'''Scorpia''' (real name '''Elaine Coll''') is a [[fictional]] [[supervillainess]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A psychotic female version of the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]], Scorpia is a long-time enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. She was recruited by [[Silvermane]] from a [[mental hospital]] and given robotic armor which enhanced her strength and speed five hundred percent.

==Fictional character biography==
Elaine Coll was a mental patient at [[Bellevue Hospital]] in Manhattan. She was chosen by [[Silvermane]] to become the new [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] after the retirement of the original. However, she opted to call herself Scorpia and was eager to get in on some action. Silvermane originally intended for Scorpia to aid [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] and [[Hydro-Man]] to deliver [[Deathlok]] to him. After interference from [[Spider-Man]], though Scorpia proved herself to be a formidable enemy, she was ultimately taken out. She recovered, and brought the surrendering Deathlok back to Silvermane. She was then ordered to ambush Spider-Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], who had infiltrated their base. She was able to wear them down, but was then betrayed by Silvermane, who shot her in the back. Infuriated, Scorpia vowed revenge, and followed Spider-Man and Daredevil to his location.  Once there, she immediately attacked, ending her dispute with the heroes and instead going right for her former employer. Mainframe, another of Silvermane's mercenaries, took control over Scorpia's cybernetic enhancements and used her to attack Spider-Man. However, she soon regained mobility and blasted Silvermane. An explosion created by [[Punisher|The Punisher]] knocked Scorpia off the building they were on, but a mentally conflicted Deathlok saved her. She then decided to flee the area, rather than be put in prison.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Power of Terror'' #2</ref>

Scorpia then joins the new [[Sinister Six]] (though there were seven members total). The team's main purpose was to stop [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] from killing any more of Spider-Man's enemies. When Kaine disguised himself as Spider-Man and attacked Hobgoblin, Scorpia immediately joined the others in the battle. However, they were not accustomed to working together, much to Scorpia's disdain. Spider-Man eventually entered the battle and was able to defeat Scorpia herself. She also participated in another battle against Spider-Man with some of her former allies, and new ones such as [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O' Lantern]]. She was defeated when Spider-Man threw Jack O'Lantern at her.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

When Mac Gargan resurfaced, Scorpia laid low for a while.<ref>''Marvel Encyclopedia'' 4: Spider-Man</ref>

Much later, Scorpia was seen attacking [[Carnegie Hall]] in search of a man named Garrison Klum, whom she had planned to assassinate in a redesigned suit. She was able to fight her way through various [[policemen]] and thugs, but was attacked by Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]. Scorpia held her own against the pair, but Black Cat was able to rip her tail off by jumping out of a hole in the wall while connected to it.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil Men Do'' #2</ref> She was later interrogated (quite humorously) by Spider-Man, where she revealed that she was hired by Alberto Ortega, the head of a local drug syndicate.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil Men Do'' #3</ref>

Scorpia appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of a group of villains in the [[Bar With No Name]] watching a fight between Spider-Man and the "Basher" on [[YouTube]]. She was among those that placed their bet with the Bookie.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #562</ref> When the real Spider-Man arrived (after it was revealed that the Spider-Man who fought Basher was actually [[Screwball (comics)|Screwball]] in disguise, Scorpia was among the villains who fought Spider-Man until Deke the bartender broke up the battle, telling them that the Bar With No Name is a sanctuary for those on the run from the law.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #563</ref>

During the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Scorpia appears as one of the female villains in the employ of Caroline Le Fay. She helps fight off [[Thanos]]' forces and later battles the [[Fearless Defenders]].<ref>''Fearless Defenders'' #10</ref> Scorpia remained in Le Fay's employ afterward, acting as one of her bodyguards during a meeting with the Mercs for Money.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Salva Espin|inker = Salva Espin|colorist = Guru-eFX|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.
