'''Malekith the Accursed''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|l|ə|k|ɪ|θ}}) is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the ruler of the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)|Dark Elves]] of [[Svartálfar|Svartalfheim]], and has come into conflict with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He once wielded the Casket of Ancient Winters.

[[Christopher Eccleston]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013).

==Publication history==
Created by [[Walt Simonson]], Malekith first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #344–349 (June–November 1984). He subsequently appeared in issues #363 (January 1986), 366-368 (April–June 1986), 485–487 (April–June 1995), and 489 (August 1995) of ''Thor''.

He made guest appearances in ''[[X-Force]] and [[Cable (comic book)|Cable Annual]]'' 1997 and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' #14 (August 1998) before again battling Thor in ''Thor'' vol. 2, #29-32 (November 2000 – February 2001). He later appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'' #134 (November 2009) and #136 (December 2009).

In 2012, Jason Aaron revived him in the ''Thor: God of Thunder'' series and he became the main antagonist in the "All New, All Different" ''Thor'' volume 4 and the crossover event ''War on the Realms''.

==Fictional character biography==
Malekith grew up during a time of war in [[Svartalfheim]]. Twelve of his older brothers died during a war with the trolls. His mother eventually sold him for two sacks of snake livers and half a barrel of pickled toads. He worked as a body burner, who cremated bodies after a battle, until he was captured by trolls. In his prison he met a wizard, who helped him escape and took him as an apprentice. Eventually the Wizard wanted to combine their powers for peace, but Malekith refused because he felt that any peace would mean that the war which forged him would have been pointless, making his existence something which wasn't meant to be. He then killed the wizard, who before dying scarred his face, and then his mother, taking the dogs of the Wild Hunt.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Malekith struck an alliance with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] on behalf of the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref>''Thor'' #344. Marvel Comics.</ref> He took control of a number of Earth humans using special food of the faerie provided by [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]. Malekith then killed Eric Willis, guardian of the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]], after learning its location.<ref>''Thor'' #345. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Master of the Hounds, Malekith hunted down Roger Willis, Eric's son and new guardian of the Casket. Malekith battled Thor, and kidnapped [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]].<ref>''Thor'' #346. Marvel Comics.</ref> Using Lorelei as bait, Malekith forced Thor to battle [[Kurse|Algrim the Strong]], one of his Dark Elf followers, then attempted to destroy both combatants by plunging them into a pool of magma. He then captured the Casket of Ancient Winters from Roger Willis.<ref>''Thor'' #347. Marvel Comics.</ref> Malekith was ultimately defeated by Thor, but not before he destroyed the Casket of Ancient Winters, releasing magical frigid force all over the Earth.<ref>''Thor'' #348. Marvel Comics.</ref> Malekith was then brought as a captive by Thor to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''Thor'' #349. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Malekith later disguised Loki as himself to take his place in the dungeon, while he disguised himself as [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], who was about to be crowned ruler of Asgard. Kurse, the being formerly known as Algrim, saw through Malekith's disguise when he reached Asgard City. Kurse then broke Malekith's neck, apparently slaying him.<ref>''Thor'' #367. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Years later, Malekith was revealed to be alive once again. Disguising himself as Balder again, he enlisted [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] to attack Alflyse, the Dark Elf Queen of the Eastern Spires, while disguised as Thor. His scheme unraveled (partially due to the appearance of Thor disguised as Hercules), and he was easily defeated by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #132, 136. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Malekith has resurfaced again intent on collecting [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]'s rings.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 5 #22, Kieron Gillen, 2014. Marvel Comics.</ref> The other ring-bearing hosts were later to meet their demise or mutilation at the hands of Malekith. In the storyline "Rings of the Mandarin", it is revealed that after reclaiming his kingdom Svartalfheim he was approached by a ring seeking a host, but bent its will to his rather than letting it control his mind. He has now begun a campaign to attack all other "Mandarins" and take their rings, desiring "the full set" before attacking [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. Though he is usually a foe of Thor and other magical beings, his opposition to Iron Man is rooted in Elves' traditional weakness towards iron.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 5 #23.NOW. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Malekith, who escaped from his prison in [[Niffleheim]], rampages across the Nine Realms in a path of revenge, targeting any Dark Elf who isn't loyal to him. Despite this fratricide, the Dark Elf Council ends up electing him as his king, as Dark Elves respect those they fear. However, the opposition to Malekith had drawn together the other races of the realms, causing a new level of understanding and cooperation. The enemies of the realms made note of this and drew together as well.<ref>''Thor: God Of Thunder'' #13 - #17 (2013 - 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Malekith the Accursed later causes Thor to lose his left arm in combat after a woman (later revealed to be [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]<ref>''Thor'' vol.4 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>) lifted Mjolnir and gained Thor's powers. Malekith's plans crossed over with the [[Minotaur (comics)|Minotaur]] of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]'s desires for more power sources.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Malekith and Minotaur came to a deal: Dario would give him the Skull of [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]] in exchange of the mineral rights of all realms Malekith conquers. Thor appeared in the roof of Roxxon Island to stop their deal, but she was attacked by the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]] who was possessing the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer Armor]].<ref>''Thor'' Vol 4 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Serpent threw Thor out of Roxxon Island and they continued battling in the oil fields below. After flying away, Malekith convinced Minotaur to celebrate their deal in the Dark Elf way and he teleported the two of them to Alfheim where they slaughtered various Light Elves.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Then Malekith and Minotaur went to Jotunheim. Using the blood of a hundred murdered Light Elves, Malekith performed a spell that resurrected King Laufey.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Malekith the Accursed appears as a member of the Dark Council alongside Minotaur, [[Ulik]], Laufey, and some unnamed Fire Demons. As before, Malekith is focusing on murdering Light Elves.<ref>''Mighty Thor'' Vol. 2 #1 (2016). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[War of the Realms]]" storyline, Malekith begins his invasion of Midgard by posing as Loki and tricking Thor into heading to Jotunheim. In addition, he did send some Dark Elf assassins after Odin. During the battle in New York, Malekith arrives with his Dark Council (consisting of [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], Kurse, Ulik, Minotaur, and a Svartalheim Bog Tiger). After Loki saves [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]] from Laufey, he fights Malekith before [[Doctor Strange]] teleports him away.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Doctor Strange tries to do magic, it is revealed that Malekith hired a coven of War Witches which prevents Doctor Strange from using his full power. After Valkyrie buys Doctor Strange time to get everyone away, she is beheaded by Malekith.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Malekith lays destruction over Europe and plans to slay [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]], and [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] with the Ebony Blade, when [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] arrives with her War Avengers (consisting of [[Deadpool]], [[Weapon H]], [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]], [[Captain Britain]], Sif and the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]) to fight against Malekith. As the War Avengers fight the Dark Elves, the Venom Symbiote tries to attack Malekith only to be absorbed into his sword.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Malekith tortures the Venom symbiote and tries to tame it as he uses a dagger of living abyss on the Venom symbiote to reshape it into [[Knull (comics)|Knull]]'s All-Black designed to kill the Asgardians. Malekith is gleeful that his forces are causing chaos around Earth. Frigga is busy fighting off the endless hordes when Malekith throws the Venom symbiote as a spear at Frigga's stomach. Before he could kill her, Odin arrives in his new armor and buys time for Frigga to destroy the Black Bifrost Bridge where its blast seemingly kills them both while defeating Malekith's forces.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> It turns out that Odin and Frigga survived where Malekith the Accursed is torturing them with the Venom symbiote at Stonehenge. When Odin shouts to Thor not to rescue them as it is a trap, Malekith stabs him to keep him quiet.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Knowing that the Thor Corps is approaching, Malekith the Accursed augments his acolytes with the Venom symbiote and then bonds with it. Frigga states to Malekith that he should flee while he still can as Malekith plans to cause the death of Thor. Odin tells Frigga to pray to Thor. When the Thor Corps arrive, Malekith uses the Venom symbiote's powers to grow wings as he declares himself the Butcher of Thors. Malekith coats Thor's golden hammer with the Venom symbiote and dubs it the Black Hammer of the Accursed. As Malekith tries to impale Jane Foster with his tongue, Thor goes into his berserker state and throws himself into Malekith as the other Thors sense the powers of the God Tempest. The younger Thor from the 6th Century cuts off Malekith's arm as Thor urges Malekith to surrender only for him to summon the Wild Hunt. However, the Wild Hunt Hounds and the Svartlheim Bog Tiger are eyeing Malekith with a hungry look as they dismember him.<ref>''War of the Realms'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Malekith finds himself in Niffleheim where Hela and Karnilla greet him and reveal that his Wild Hunt hounds and the Svartalheim Bog Tiger also died soon after devouring him where they have been poisoned by the black magic he had used to bend the Venom symbiote to his will. Karnilla explains that when they reassembled the pieces of his soul they had drawn out of the beast's stomachs, they had found the last fragment of his true self--the little boy who had suffered through his childhood as a victim of war. Hela and Karnilla tell a horrified Malekith that his punishment will be to witness his younger self spend eternity with the hounds and the Svartalheim Bog Tiger. He is then chained to a rock with his eyes sewn open by Karnilla. As Malekith begs for mercy, the Wild Hunt hounds and the Svartalheim Bog Tiger are sent through a portal to Valhalla where they are transformed into puppies and a tiger cub respectively. They are then seen happily playing with the young Malekith. As the young Malekith has finally found peace and happiness, Malekith screams at the torment of having to watch this.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 5 #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Malekith has all the normal attributes of a member of the race of dark elves, although his abilities are a result of above-average development. He possesses superhuman intellect, strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility and reflexes.

As a dark elf, Malekith also has the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a variety of effects, including teleportation, energy projection, physical malleability, flight (by transforming into mist), illusion casting, and the ability to change the shape and appearance of other beings or objects.

Malekith, like all Dark Elves, has a vulnerability to iron, which disrupts or cancels his magical spells.

Soon after, Malekith returns with an army wanting to conquer Asgard, and bring down the nine kingdoms, which was part of Loki's plan.
