Kaecilius and his Zealot followers, believing in Dormammu's promise of eternal life, proceed to destroy the Sanctums so Earth can be consumed by the Dark Dimension. But Strange manages to convince Dormammu to renounce his attack on Earth while having the entity honor his promise to Kaecilius by dragging him and his surviving followers into the Dark Dimension.<ref name="MarvelProductionBegins">{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/25486/marvels_doctor_strange_begins_production |title=Marvel's 'Doctor Strange' Begins Production |publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |date=November 24, 2015 |accessdate=November 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dHpFCvvP?url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/25486/marvels_doctor_strange_begins_production |archivedate=November 24, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref><ref name="PreludeSynopsis">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/doctor-strange-prequel-comic-hints-at-movie-secrets-introduces-another-marvel-villain |title="Doctor Strange" Prequel Comic Hints At Movie Secrets, Introduces Another Marvel Villain |last=Couto |first=Anthony |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=July 6, 2016 |accessdate=July 7, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ioaT58T9?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/codesrv/be97611739e06314e4f58a47b545ee6b.20160630155726.css |archivedate=July 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref><ref name="Kaecilius">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/29811-doctor-strange-s-villain-female-lead-confirmed.html |title=Doctor Strange's Villain & Female Lead Confirmed |last=Marston |first=George |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=June 21, 2016 |accessdate=July 6, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6io0vlf10?url=http://www.newsarama.com/29811-doctor-strange-s-villain-female-lead-confirmed.html |archivedate=July 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>
