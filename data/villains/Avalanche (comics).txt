'''Avalanche''' the name of two [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Each character is usually depicted as an enemy of the [[X-Men]].

The Dominikos Petrakis version of Avalanche is a [[Crete|Cretan]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses the ability to generate seismic waves from his hands that are strong enough to create earthquakes of varying sizes and to disintegrate any substance other than living tissue. He has been a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. The [[animated series]] ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' portrays him as Lance Alvers, a misguided mutant teenager and romantic [[Romantic interest|love interest]] of the X-Men's [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]].

===Dominikos Petrakis===
{{tense|date=September 2011}}
Avalanche's story before [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] recruits him for the second [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] is largely a mystery. It is known, however, that he is an immigrant from the Greek island of [[Crete]]. There, he lives a quiet life until Mystique invites him to join her new Brotherhood. During his first public appearance with the Brotherhood, the team unsuccessfully attempts to assassinate [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] during his hearings and testimony on his belief that mutants pose a mortal threat to humanity. The X-Men arrive to stop the assassination and battle the new Brotherhood.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #141–142</ref> After escaping the fray, Avalanche continues his support of Mutant supremacy via terrorist and criminal activities and battling the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with the Brotherhood.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #10</ref>

Avalanche briefly leaves the Brotherhood and attempts to blackmail the state of California into paying him an enormous sum to prevent him from using his power to generate an earthquake. Avalanche fights the [[Hulk]] alongside [[Outcasts (Marvel Comics Subterranea)|Landslide]] on this occasion and suffers broken arms when he attempts to use his powers against the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #263</ref> When he returns to the Brotherhood, together they encounter [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] and [[Hybrid (Jimmy Marks)|Hybrid]].<ref>''Rom'' #31–32</ref> The team later battles the X-Men as the "Brotherhood of Evil Mutants" one final time.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #177–178</ref>

After that, The Brotherhood's leader Mystique offered the group's services to the United States government. Their first mission under their new name of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]] was to capture the mutant [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] on behalf of the federal government.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #199</ref> The government then sent Freedom Force to capture the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #15; ''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #1</ref> While seeking to arrest [[Rusty Collins]], he clashed with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #8–10</ref> Freedom Force then fought the X-Men in Dallas and was present at the X-Men's apparent demise,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #223–227</ref> and battled the [[New Mutants]] in Dallas as well.<ref>''New Mutants'' #65</ref> Freedom Force then battled [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #30–31</ref> Freedom Force again tried to arrest Rusty Collins and battled the New Mutants,<ref>''New Mutants'' #78</ref> but were able to arrest Rusty and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]] as well.<ref>''New Mutants'' #80</ref> They were also dispatched to rescue Senator [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]] from a South American drug syndicate that had kidnapped him, battling the syndicate's superhuman agents in the process.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents #41''</ref> Freedom Force also had a costly battle with the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] on [[Muir Island]] where a number of members were killed or seriously injured.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #255</ref> During the [[Acts of Vengeance]], Avalanche teamed with [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] against the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #312</ref> Avalanche then joined Freedom Force's effort to stop a prison breakout at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Avengers: Deathtrap, the Vault''</ref> Avalanche then participated in Freedom Force's final mission in Kuwait. He abandoned Blob and Pyro during the battle with [[Desert Sword]] to save the seriously injured [[Crimson Commando]].<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #7; ''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #15; ''X-Factor Annual'' #6</ref>

When Freedom Force was disbanded after the botched mission in the Gulf War, Avalanche continued to work for the government as part of Project: Wideawake, but soon left when he found out that his friend [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] had contracted the [[Legacy Virus]].<ref>''X-Men Annual'' (2nd volume) #2</ref>

By the time the X-Men establish themselves in San Francisco, Avalanche, going by the alias "Nick", establishes a bar in order to make a living away from crime. When the X-Men moved their headquarters to San Francisco, Petros was frightened that they would eventually come for him for his past crimes. As he was packing in hopes of leaving his new-found life, the X-Men popped in with a friendly warning that they have a truce but will be back if he ever decides to return to a life of crime. As they leave, with his place of business and apartment trashed, Petros looks around, mumbling to himself.<ref name="X-Men: Manifest Destiny #5"/>

When Norman Osborn starts his war against Mutants in the heart of San Francisco, Gambit sees Avalanche during the riots with [[Erg (comics)|Erg]] and when [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] makes himself known, Avalanche attacks him by causing the earth to rise up under him. Ares then knocks him out by choking him.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #226''</ref> He is seen one more time, sitting drunk in his own bar together with other mutants. They are angry that humans are trying to prevent new mutant births and Avalanche participates in the riot. He has the unfortunate circumstance of being paired up against [[Daken]], who easily dodges the worried Avalanche's tremor and was about to slice him. He is taken into custody along with several other mutants who participated in the riots.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #7</ref> Eventually Avalanche and the other imprisoned mutants are freed by the [[X-Force]] and he becomes a resident of Utopia.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus #1''</ref>

While Utopia and all of San Francisco are trapped in an energy dome created by Bastion, and the mutant race face extermination at the hands of Nimrod Sentinels from the future, Avalanche is among many of Utopia's non-X-Men residents who have now taken up fighting alongside their former rivals. He can be seen fighting alongside the X-Men [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], and [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]], defending the passage of the Bart Tunnels.<ref>''New Mutants'' (vol. 3) #14 (2010)</ref> As an "X-Man", Avalanche is also called in by Cyclops during the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline to help them stop Kurrth. Avalanche uses his powers to create a chasm that Kurrth would not cross, but Kurrth creates a psychic bridge for him and his brainwashed followers to cross anyway.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #542</ref>

Avalanche is kidnapped by the [[Red Skull]] who removed part of his brain, replacing it with a machine that turned Avalanche into a puppet to attack New York City. As [[Captain America]] tries to stop him, he claimed that "the inciting act is complete" and jumped to his apparent death.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #1</ref>

===Lance Alvers===
A somehow-repowered [[Mesmero (comics)|Mesmero]] brainwashed the second Avalanche into joining his Brotherhood of Mutants which was secretly funded by anti-mutant activist Lydia Nance. Avalanche's first mission with the Brotherhood of Mutants was to kidnap Mayor Bill de Blaso and held him hostage.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> The X-Men arrived and defeated the Brotherhood of Mutants who are then arrested by the arriving S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents<ref>''X-Men Gold'' Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As Lydia Nance still had a use for the Brotherhood of Mutants, she orchestrated Mesmero's escape from the Box.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' Vol. 2 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mesmero once again lured Avalanche and the second Pyro into helping him out again. They were to attack a yacht that was owned by the Heritage Initiative at the time of its fundraiser. They group fought the X-Men alongside the NYPD.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' Vol. 2 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Brotherhood of Mutants managed to get away and fall back to their base. When Mesmero states that the Brotherhood of Mutants are still under Lydia Nance's paycheck, Pyro takes his leave since he didn't want to work for an anti-mutant activist. Avalanche then demanded from Mesmero to get Pyro's cut.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' Vol. 2 #22. Marvel Comics</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Dominikos Petrakis version of Avalanche is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the superhuman ability to generate powerful seismic waves from his hands, creating highly destructive effects. The waves can cause an inorganic object to shatter or crumble into dust and has in recent years been shown to affect organic matter as well. When directed against large objects like buildings or upon the earth itself, the seismic waves can produce effects similar to those of an earthquake or avalanche within limited areas. Avalanche need not touch an object to affect it; he can direct the waves against it from some distance away. Avalanche himself is immune to the generation of his own vibratory waves. However, if the seismic waves were reflected back at him, he would be injured. Avalanche's power originally had little or no effect on organic tissue, with the reflected vibrations from organic matter ("feedback") injuring him, as when he once tried to attack the Hulk, but lately this has appeared to no longer be the case. As yet there is no known limit to the amount of area upon which Avalanche can use his powers at one time. There is no evidence yet, however, that he could create an earthquake capable of destroying an entire city. Avalanche is a fair hand-to-hand combatant and received unarmed combat training while a member of Freedom Force. Avalanche wears an armored battle suit that gives him enhanced resistance to injury, up to and including protecting him from a [[land mine]]. While a member of Freedom Force, he used a two-way radio device for communication with other Freedom Force members.

The unidentified Avalanche has the same abilities as the first version except that he can also target organic tissue which the first version was unable to do.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Avalanche was one of the select mutants that were approached by Sinister and offered a chance to join his Elite Mutant Force. Avalanche, however, refused Sinister's offer, for which he was captured at the Breeding Pens. During an escape attempt, Avalanche was killed and his corpse turned over to the [[Dark Beast]] for experimentation.<ref>''Factor X'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies: Dead Days]]'', he is seen as a zombie alongside a zombie version of the Freedom Force fighting the suddenly zombified X-Men.<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===House of M===
In the "[[House of M]]" reality, Dominic appears as a member of the NYPD strikeforce known as the Brotherhood.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #2</ref>

===Old Man Logan===
In the pages of ''[[Old Man Logan]]'', Avalanche was among the villains that attacked the Avengers in Connecticut. After [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]] killed [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Avalanche used his powers to open up a hole in the ground and Moloids started crawling over Giant-Man enough for him to fall to the ground.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It was also mentioned that Avalanche was the one who blinded [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 3 #66. Marvel Comics.</ref> This was seen in the pages of "Old Man Hawkeye" where he vibrated Hawkeye's skull after he killed [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]].<ref>''Old Man Hawkeye'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===

* In the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' animated series, Avalanche (voiced by Christopher Grey) has been heavily re-imagined. Here, he is a high school student named '''Lance Alvers'''. He is a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]]. Originally nothing more than an aggressive thug, he eventually developed a more sympathetic, mature and serious attitude, who helps his teammates like they are brothers, and acts in a strange sort of way like a younger version of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. The close romantic relationship between Avalanche and [[Kitty Pryde]], which begins at the beginning of the second season, is a subplot throughout the series. Lance also shares an intense rivalry with [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]], which manifests on several occasions in the series (particularly in the episodes "Survival of the Fittest" and "Joyride"). In the end, he helps fight [[Apocalypse (Marvel Comics)|Apocalypse]], reunites with Kitty and is shown – along with his Brotherhood friends – joining a SHIELD-sanctioned unit (a nod to Freedom Force) in the future.
