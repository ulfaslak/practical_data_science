'''Michael Korvac''' (often called '''Korvac''' or '''The Enemy''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|Giant-Size Defenders]]'' #3 (Jan. 1975) and was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Jim Starlin]].

==Publication history==
Korvac debuted in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|Giant-Size Defenders]]'' #3 (1975), and according to creator Gerber: "The character really was a throwaway, created for one story. And I never intended to bring him back, because, among other things, I hated the name! I still think it sounds more like a [[vacuum cleaner]] than a villain."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/howard_the_duck/message/3389 |title=members only. Retrieved 11 October 2006 |publisher=Groups.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref>

However, [[Roger Stern]] and [[Len Wein]] felt that Korvac, being a native of the 31st century, made a natural adversary for the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], and wrote a story in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] Annual'' #6 (1977) which was intended to set him up in that role.<ref name="back65">{{cite journal|last=Buttery|first=Jarrod |title=Explore the Marvel Universe of the 31st Century with... the Guardians of the Galaxy|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65|pages=27|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> The Guardians of the Galaxy's own series, ''[[Marvel Presents]]'', was cancelled before ''Thor Annual'' #6 was published, cutting off Stern's plans to use Korvac there.<ref name="back65"/> Korvac instead appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #167, 168, 170 - 177 (January - November 1978), later called the "Korvac Saga". The eleven issues were written by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[David Michelinie]], with art by [[George Pérez]] and [[David Wenzel]].

A [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] edition reprinted the Korvac Saga in 1991, and included a new [[epilogue]] written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and drawn by [[Tom Morgan (artist)|Tom Morgan]]. Although the revised conclusion cast Korvac as a villain, it was removed by editor [[Tom Brevoort]] when reprinted as ''Avengers Legends Volume 2: The Korvac Saga'' in 2003.

Korvac reappeared briefly in ''Avengers Annual'' #16 (1987). He is heavily referenced in a 1991 summer annual crossover storyline: ''[[Fantastic Four]] Annual'' #24 (1991); ''Thor Annual'' #16 (1991); ''[[Silver Surfer]] Annual'' #4 (1991) and ''Guardians of the Galaxy Annual'' #1 (1991). The character returned in ''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 3, #17 - 19 (May - July 1999).

Korvac also appeared in both volumes of the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] title ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'', in issues #32 (April 1982) and vol. 2, issue #36 (April 1992). Korvac made a return to the mainstream 616 universe in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #11 (March 2011).

To tie-in with the movie ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', an all-ages retelling of the Korvac Saga was issued in December 2010 and ended in March 2011 titled ''Captain America: The Korvac Saga''. The story was condensed and focused primarily on Captain America journeying to the future in pursuit of Korvac with the help of [[Nikki (comics)|Nikki]] and [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27160|title=McCool Reimagines The Korvac Saga.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early exploits===
Michael Korvac is a computer [[technician]] in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] [[Earth-691]].<ref>''The Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Worlds'' 2005</ref> When the [[Sol System]] and its colonies are conquered by the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Badoon|Brotherhood of Badoon]] in the year 3007 AD, Korvac becomes a collaborator and traitor to the human race. Caught asleep at a machine while working, the Badoon punish Korvac by grafting his upper body to a machine, effectively making him a [[cyborg]].

Korvac is then transported through time by the [[Elders of the Universe|Elder of the Universe]] the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], who utilizes him as a pawn in battling the hero [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #3 (Jan. 1975)</ref>

It is eventually revealed that Korvac deliberately lost the fight so he can be able to discreetly scan and analyze the Grandmaster's cosmic power. Gaining several new abilities from this analysis, Korvac then kills his Badoon masters and plans to conquer the cosmos. Korvac recruits a group of aliens called the "Minions of Menace" and attempts to cause Earth's sun to go [[nova]], but is defeated by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] and the time-traveling Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Thor'' Annual #6 (1977)</ref>

==="The Korvac Saga"<!--quotation marks for story arcs-->===
Korvac flees across time and space to the [[Earth-616]] universe. Upon arrival, Korvac discovers the space station of the entity [[Galactus]]. While attempting to download the knowledge of Galactus from the station into his own system, Korvac is imbued with the [[Power Cosmic]] and becomes god-like. Korvac then recreates himself as a perfect humanoid form, and posing as a human called "Michael", travels to Earth with the intent of reshaping it into a [[utopia]]. Korvac, however, is pursued by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who join forces with the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in a bid to stop the villain.

Guardian member [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]] finds Korvac and battles him in secret. Korvac, however, disintegrates Starhawk and then recreates him, but removes from the hero the ability to perceive Korvac in any way so as to avoid future detection. The Elder of the Universe known as the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] foresees the coming of two beings that would be capable of challenging the Elders (Korvac and [[Thanos]]), and remakes his own daughter Carina into a being of incredible power to use as a weapon against them. Carina does meet Korvac, but the two fall in love and she begins to sympathize with him. The Collector is defeated by the Avengers after a failed bid to "collect" and protect the heroes from Korvac, who upon discovering the Collector's plot disintegrates the Elder.

[[Iron Man]] eventually tracks Korvac to a residential neighborhood in [[Forest Hills Gardens, Queens|Forest Hills Gardens]], in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The entire Avengers roster, aided by the heroine [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], and the Guardians of the Galaxy, confront Korvac and Carina, who pose as a middle class couple. Korvac's deception is revealed when [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]] states he cannot see the man called "Michael". Realizing that he has been discovered, and that [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]] such as [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] are now aware of his existence, Korvac is forced into battle.

Korvac slays wave after wave of heroes, and is finally caught off guard and weakened by [[Captain America]] and [[Wonder Man]]. Although able to kill the heroes, Korvac is weakened further by the combined efforts of Starhawk, Iron Man, the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Sensing that Carina now doubts him, Korvac commits suicide through an act of will. An angered Carina attacks the surviving heroes, but is finally slain by Thor. The entire battle is watched by part-time Avenger [[Moondragon]], who realizes that Korvac only wanted to help mankind, with his dying act being to restore the Avengers and Guardians to life.<ref>''Avengers'' #167 - 177 (Jan. - Nov. 1978)</ref>

==="The Korvac Quest"<!--quotation marks for story arcs-->===
It is revealed that Korvac discarded his power when near death after sensing that Galactus had activated the weapon the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] in retaliation for his previous intrusion. Korvac's suicidal act of will preserves his power and consciousness, which is sent forward through time to inhabit various descendants of his. Starhawk becomes aware of this, and the Guardians of the Galaxy pursue Korvac's essence through time. The power eventually reaches the year 2977 AD and inhabits Michael's father, Jordan, who is killed in battle with the Guardians. Jordan's widow, Myra, vows to teach the infant Michael that the Guardians were responsible for his father's death on the day of his birth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #24; ''Thor'' Annual #16; ''Silver Surfer'' Annual #4 and ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Annual #1 (all 1991)</ref>

===Later appearances===
Korvac is briefly resurrected in human form by the Grandmaster to battle [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #16 (1987)</ref> When Korvac's attempt to use Captain America in a scheme to steal the power of a [[Cosmic Cube]] from [[Red Skull]] ultimately failed, Red Skull used his internalized Cube power to scatter Korvac across six dimensions.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 3, #19 (July 1998)</ref>

In ''[[Avengers Academy]]'', Korvac's wife Carina was mistakenly resurrected by [[Veil (comics)|Veil]] (believing that she is helping to resurrect [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]). Korvac returns for her and Hank Pym offers to return Carina to Korvac, but she refuses to go with him, choosing nonexistence over him (even though she is apparently immortal, as is her father). A battle commences pitting Korvac against all current Avengers teams. He is weakened by them and then attacked by adult versions of the Academy's students.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #11</ref> After a brutal battle, Veil phases into his body, which temporarily paralyzes Korvac, and [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]] then completely annihilates Korvac with a projected blast of anti-matter.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Korvac was originally a normal man until the [[Badoon]] amputated the lower half of his body and grafted his upper body and nervous system onto a specialized computer module capable of siphoning energy from virtually any source. Korvac's mechanical module could also tap and synthesize any form of energy and concealed advanced weaponry.

After downloading information from Galactus' ship and acquiring the [[Power Cosmic]], Korvac is capable of energy projection, matter alteration, [[teleportation]], astral projection,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> and manipulation of time and space. In his perfect human form, Korvac retained all his cosmic abilities and could use these to achieve virtually any effect.

Michael Korvac is also a brilliant computer scientist, a master strategist, and a formidable hand-to-hand combatant.
