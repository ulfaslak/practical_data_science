==Publication history==
Arclight first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #210-211 (October–November 1986), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]

[[Walt Simonson]] said that "when [[Jon Bogdanove]] drew Arclight in ''Power Pack'', she had a much different figure than I gave her in ''X-Factor''. But I went back and did a little bit of revision work in my book after I'd seen what John had done."<ref>{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Sanderson | authorlink = Peter Sanderson | date = October 1986 | title = Walt & Louise Simonson | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 39 | page = 44 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>

Arclight received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #1.

==Fictional character biography==
Arclight served with the American ground forces during the [[Vietnam War]], and she is still haunted by memories of that place.<ref name="first">''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #10 (November 1986)</ref> She has redirected her rage into bodybuilding, which she uses to augment her mutant powers.  Her mutant ability enables her to create [[shock wave]]s through physical contact, usually combined with her super strength in form of punches and blows.  During a few of her appearances she has been shown to project a bright light upon impact of her hands.

As a war veteran, she is well versed in battle and is known as one of the most bloodthirsty members of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], the group responsible for the "[[Mutant Massacre]]". Her relationship with teammate [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]] has also made her second-in-command. During their first mission, Arclight kills dozens of underground-dwelling mutants known as [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].<ref name="first"/> She also took some time off to answer [[Superia]]'s invitation to join her female group of villains, the [[Femizons]].<ref>''Power Pack'' vol. 1 #27 (December 1986)</ref>

Though the details of her recruitment by [[Mister Sinister]] to the Marauders remain unrevealed, she has participated in all of the group's major operations.  Due to Sinister cloning the Marauders multiple times, it is hard to determine if the 'original' Arclight has been present in all of them.

Following [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Arclight became one of the so-called [[X-Men: The 198|198]], one of the few remaining mutants retaining their powers, and a refugee at the [[X-Mansion]].<ref>''X-Men: The 198'' #2-5 (April–July 2006)</ref> She later returns as a member of the New Marauders, alongside old members like Scalphunter and new ones like [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and [[Lady Mastermind]].<ref>[[X-Men: Legacy|''X-Men'' vol. 2]] #200</ref>

During [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah CompleX]] in the final battle on Muir Isle, she is injured by [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] who bites her in the neck.<ref>''X-Men'' #200-203 (August–November 2007)</ref> She is seen later being defeated by [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #46 (March 2008)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Arclight possesses the ability to generate seismic energies with her hands that cause shock waves and geo tremors. She also has superhuman strength, stamina, durability and resiliency.

==Other versions==
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Arclight (alongside [[Mentallo]] and Wild Child) is a member of the Red Guard that was positioned in Australia to work with Exodus.<ref>''Hulk: Broken Worlds'' #1</ref>

* Arclight appeared in the 2006 motion picture ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' played by [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] fashion [[Model (person)|model]] and [[actress]] [[Omahyra Mota]].
