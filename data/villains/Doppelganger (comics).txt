The '''Doppelganger''', also called the '''Spider-Doppelganger''', is a [[fictional character]] and [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
Doppelganger first appeared in ''[[The Infinity War]]'' #1 and was created by [[Jim Starlin]], [[Ron Lim]], and [[Al Milgrom]].

==Fictional character biography==
Doppelganger is an evil, near-mindless duplicate of [[Spider-Man]] that was created by [[Adam Warlock#The Magus|Magus]] during the battle known as the [[The Infinity War|Infinity War]]. The eight-limbed creature was one of many [[doppelgänger]]s created by Magus during this conflict. The Doppelganger possesses Spider-Man's strength, speed, wall-climbing abilities, and spider-sense, and also has six arms, claws, fangs, and the ability to produce its own razor-edged webbing. It acts like an animal, and growls and hisses rather than speaks.{{issue|date=July 2015}}

The Doppelganger began life as a living fractal, a geometric pattern in the Dimension of Manifestations, able to assume the forms and attributes of any being, real or abstract. When a mysterious Magus sets out to obtain the vast power of the Infinity Gauntlet, he contracts the ruling fractal, Prime Manifester Anthropomorpho, to transform several young fractals into monstrous versions of Earth's super heroes; the Doppelganger is one such creation, based upon Spider-Man. It and its brethren are sent to [[Earth-616|Earth]] to attack the heroes in the so-called [[The Infinity War|Infinity War]]. The Doppelganger interrupts a fight between Spider-Man and [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]], who impales the creature upon a fence. Though most of the fractal doubles were completely destroyed upon being defeated, the Doppelganger is retrieved by the demonic [[Demogoblin]], who infuses it with supernatural energy, enabling it to remain in the Earth dimension even following Magus' defeat.{{issue|date=July 2015}} Demogoblin directs the Doppelganger in a grudge against Hobgoblin, whom the altruistic Spider-Man protects. The foursome's fight joins another battle where the supernatural [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Blaze]] are fighting a group of demonic Deathspawn and Spider-Man's murderous nemesis [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. Both the Doppelganger and Demogoblin are subsequently pulled underground by the Deathspawn, with two Deathspawn briefly taking up silent residence within the Doppelganger's body.{{issue|date=July 2015}}

After being separated from the Demogoblin, the disoriented Doppelganger wanders around [[New York City|New York]] for some time. By the beginning of the ''[[Maximum Carnage]]'' storyline, it is attacked by the psychotic [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], who mistakes the creature as his mortal enemy, Spider-Man. However, Carnage's companion, the equally insane [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], takes a liking to the Doppelganger, and the deranged couple introduces their new "son" to the "pleasure" of random murder. During their spree, the three are joined by Demogoblin and [[Carrion (comics)#Malcolm McBride|Carrion]]; they also fight Spider-Man, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]], and others. The Doppelganger becomes devoted to Shriek; when Carnage attacks her for rebellious behavior, it springs to her defense, but Carnage guts it and kicks it to the street several stories below, supposedly killing it. Carnage and the others were defeated shortly afterwards.<ref>'''''Maximum Carnage''''': ''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #1–2; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #101–103; ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #378–380; ''Spider-Man'' #35–37; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #201–203</ref>

Doppelganger reappears, with a new physical configuration, trying to rescue Shriek (who he is implied to have been covertly visiting at Ravencroft) from an armored truck, but he is shot in half in the process by the [[iron rangers]]. Doppelganger is collected by Hall Industries, revives on the autopsy table, and joins Shriek in causing havoc in New York. When Doppelganger attempts to save Shriek from the new symbiote [[Scorn (Marvel Comics)|Scorn]], he is knocked aside, and forced to flee with Carnage.<ref>''Carnage'' #1–5</ref> When Carnage overtakes a Colorado town, the Mercury Team is able to locate him by attacking and following Doppelganger, who is referred to as "that creepy thing that looks like Spider-Man". Doppelganger later helps Carnage fight the Mercury Team, and is shown escaping after Carnage is captured, and a portion of the town is [[Firebombing|firebombed]] by the military.<ref>''Carnage U.S.A.'' #1–5</ref>

Doppelganger is later shown among the Spider-Totems assembled to help combat [[Morlun]] and the other [[Inheritors (comics)|Inheritors]] in ''[[Spider-Verse]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Slott|penciller = Ty Templeton and Paco Herrera|inker = Ty Templeton|story = The Little Things|title = Spider-Verse|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = 14 January 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Doppelganger eventually reunites with Carnage and Shriek again and together formed a cult dedicated in worshiping [[Knull (comics)|Knull]]. They eventually return to Doverton and got the codexes–the symbiote remnants left on the bodies of previous hosts–from the citizens who were infected by Carnage.<ref>''Web of Venom Cult of Carnage'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Doppelganger's abilities are very similar to Spider-Man's, including superhuman strength (able to lift 65 tons), agility, stamina, reflexes, and speed. It can also stick to walls and shoot razor-sharp webbing from the palms of its hands. It has two extra sets of arms, each hand possessing hardened talons that can tear through human tissue. The Spider-Doppelganger is physically stronger than Spider-Man, though the exact limit of his strength is unknown. It is noticeably unintelligent, seemingly limited to [[instinct|animal instinct]], although it was capable of following instructions from its 'mother' [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], and was capable of rudimentary speech in its reappearance. Its body was also somewhat malleable and could form different shapes, although this attribute was not seen in its appearances in ''Maximum Carnage''. According to scientists who were briefly able to study him after an apparent death, Doppelganger is "inorganic and may not have been legally alive to begin with".
