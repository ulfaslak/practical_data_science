'''Maker''', also known as '''Ultimate Reed Richards''', is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] turned [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the [[Ultimate Marvel]]'s version of [[Mister Fantastic]] who later turns into the villainous Maker; he eventually becomes part of the regular [[Marvel Universe]], serving as an enemy and evil foil to his parallel universe counterpart.

==Publication history==
Ultimate Reed Richards bears a resemblance to his [[Earth-616]] counterpart, however, he differs in many aspects: the origin of his powers is different and he is much younger. The character was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]], [[Mark Millar]] and [[Adam Kubert]], and debuted in early [[2004 in comics|2004]] in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19933 |title=NYCC: Joe Pokaski On "Ultimate Fantastic Four Requiem" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2011-02-25}}</ref>

In 2011, the character calls himself Maker and is a nemesis to the [[Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates|Ultimates]].

==Fictional character biography==
Reed Richards is a [[child prodigy|child genius]] who, as a result of demonstrating a [[teleportation|teleporter]] at a school science fair, is recruited for a government program sponsoring other young minds. He conducts his research at a facility located in the Baxter Building in [[Manhattan]], where he meets [[Alternative versions of the Human Torch#Ultimate Marvel|Johnny Storm]] and [[Invisible Woman#Ultimate Marvel|Sue Storm]], whom Reed becomes romantically involved with. [[Alternative versions of the Thing#Ultimate Marvel|Ben Grimm]] is his only friend and protector. At the age of 21, he and several others attempted to teleport organic material through an alternate [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] called the [[Negative Zone|N-Zone]]. The experiment goes awry and gives Reed superpowers, which enable him to stretch his body parts to incredible lengths and endow him with enhanced durability.

After the ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'' miniseries resulted in the death of many heroes, Reed and Sue break up and the Fantastic Four is disbanded. Reed is later seen working with aliens to pillage the artifacts stored at [[Project Pegasus|Project Pegasus]]. It becomes clear that Reed's worldview has changed to a more sinister outlook. In ''[[Ultimate Enemy]]'', he is shown to be living with his parents again before an explosion seemingly kills them.<ref>''Ultimate Enemy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In ''[[Ultimate Mystery]]'', Reed is revealed to have orchestrated his family's murders and faked his own death before allying himself with the attacking aliens.<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> ''[[Ultimate Doomsday]]'' sees Reed confronted by the remaining members of the Fantastic Four, as well as [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]], [[Mahr Vehl]], and the [[Ultimates]]. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear to his former friends that Reed is a threat to the world. Part of his motivation to become a villain is that he no longer likes his home dimension and wishes he could find another world to improve.<ref>''Ultimate Doom''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''[[Ultimate Fallout]]'', Reed is revealed to have survived his defeat and is shown trapped in the [[Negative Zone]]. He soon escapes and returns to his world, where he vows to win back his friends by saving the planet.<ref>Ultimate Fallout #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> In ''[[Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates]]'', Reed is revealed to be the Maker, creator of The City and leader of the [[Future Foundation|Children of Tomorrow]], a race of genetically engineered superhumans. He has come back to fight against the Ultimates after spending 1,000 years in the distant future - having been unable to age due to his powers - and the top of his head has been 'stretched' in order to increase his intelligence. It is not until Reed reveals his face to [[Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)|Thor]] that the Ultimates learn his true identity.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Jonathan Hickman]] | Penciller = [[Esad Ribic]] and [[Brandon Peterson]] | Colorist = [[John Rauch]] | Title = Ultimate Comics: Ultimates | Issue = 10 | Date = April 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Invisible Woman traps the Maker into a small psychic bubble, but he survives.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Jonathan Hickman]] | Penciller = [[Esad Ribic]] and [[Brandon Peterson]] | Colorist = [[John Rauch]] | Title = Ultimate Comics: Ultimates | Issue = 12 | Date = June 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Later, the Maker assembles part of the [[Infinity Gauntlet]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the primary [[Galactus]] arrives in the Ultimate Universe due to a temporal distortion,<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> the Ultimates are forced to approach Reed for help after [[Mysterio]] (who was trapped in the Ultimate universe) identifies Galactus and reveals having been defeated by Earth-616's Reed Richards in the past.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Accompanied by the new [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]], Reed travels to Earth-616 to access his counterpart's files. Before he departs, he and Miles are confronted by [[Valeria Richards]], leaving Reed shaken as he witnesses the family he and Sue could have had.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Based on his counterpart's files on Galactus, Reed defeats him by sending him to the Negative Zone, where he can starve to death due to the Negative Zone consisting entirely of anti-matter and thus providing nothing for Galactus to consume.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Secret Wars===
[[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] secretly recruits Reed to help draft counter-measures to doomsday scenarios, where he eventually starts having to fight Incursions. While working on stopping another, he finds [[Cabal (comics)|The Cabal]] escaping from another destroyed Earth.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following the final incursion, Reed and the Cabal escape the destruction of Earth-1610 in a "life-raft" created for that purpose. Learning that they are on a [[Battleworld|new world]] ruled by [[Doctor Doom|God Emperor]] using the power of the [[Beyonders]] and [[Molecule Man]], Reed works with his Earth-616 counterpart to devise a means of defeating Doom. However, they are divided due to their morals, as Ultimate Reed wishes to kill their enemy while 616-Reed is more concerned with ensuring that the world can survive without him.<ref>''Secret Wars'' (2015 series) #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> After they find Molecule Man, the Maker attempts to eliminate 616-Reed by devolving his counterpart into a monkey. However, Molecule Man intervenes, returning Reed to normal while turning the Maker into pepperoni pizzas.<ref>''Secret Wars'' (2015 series) #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===New Avengers===
Despite this, the Maker survives and emerged in the new Prime Earth, where he forms the science-based terrorist organization W.H.I.S.P.E.R. to continue experimenting for his own gain. His first experiment focuses on harnessing the souls of the dead to try and capture the souls of previous universes.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol 4 #1</ref> Maker also assembles a new incarnation of the [[Revengers]], with plans to have them face the New Avengers. They consist of Asti the All-Seeing, [[Paibok]], [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], [[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|White Tiger]], and alternate versions of [[Angar the Screamer]] and Skar.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Civil War II]]" storyline, the New Revengers gain City's O.M.N.I.T.R.O.C.U.S form as its latest member.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #12</ref> As [[Advanced Idea Mechanics#Avengers Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] is facing off against [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Maker takes advantage of this by sending his New Revengers to attack them.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #13</ref> While O.M.N.I.T.R.O.C.U.S. keeps [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] trapped in his office while having his own defense system attack him, Angela del Toro fights her aunt [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|Ava Ayala]] while the other Revengers members attack the rest of the New Avengers and the staff of Avengers Base Two.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #14</ref> Donning a variation of the Rescue armor, [[Toni Ho]] manages to slay the alternate Skar. Also, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] managed to get free from O.M.N.I.T.R.O.C.U.S.' clutches with the help of [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] while Ava frees Angela from the combined influences of the Tiger God and the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #15</ref> The remaining members of the New Revengers face off against the New Avengers and A.I.M. While the remaining members of the New Revengers are defeated, Maker escapes.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sunspot later confronts Maker aboard fake [[Air Force One]] and defeats him. Sunspot then delivers Maker to the government, which imprisons him in a special cell.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Maker later appears as a member of Project Oversight. He was seen interrogating [[Eddie Brock]] about the incident revolving around the Grendel symbiote and Knull while stating that he is not the Mister Fantastic that he is familiar with. In addition, he talked about how the Venom symbiote has lost its personality, saying it just a guard dog now, that it can't give Eddie powers anymore. Maker throws a scalpel at Eddie, the Venom symbiote emerges from his shirt and catches it. When Eddie asks Maker if he would be able to restore it, Maker states that the only way to do that is to connect it to the symbiote hive mind and the last person to do that was the late [[Flash Thompson]]. As Maker comments that he has ways of extracting the information he needs, Eddie asks in a distraught voice if Flash is really dead.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>
Some time after, Maker reveals to Eddie that he got hold of Venom's remnants left in Flash's body prior to becoming [[Anti-Venom (comics)|Anti-Venom]], which contained his genetic memory and tells Eddie that it can help restore the symbiote. Maker also tells to Eddie that he's planning to get more samples from Flash's dead body, but Eddie who now considers Flash as a brother, unleashes the symbiote to Maker and gets the sample. Afterwards, he tries to escape the facility, but the sample goes to his symbiote taking the form of Flash's version of the suit. Now the symbiote with the mind of Flash Thompson helps Eddie to escape. After that, Maker goes to his office revealing that he had been seeing the entire event of [[Infinity Wars]].<ref>''Venom #7''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ultimate Reed Richards's power of elasticity have been increased in comparison to his [[Mister Fantastic|counterpart]]. He can stretch his eyes, specifically the lens so that he does not need his glasses or any other visual augmentation but can only sustain this for short periods. It's revealed that his abilities allow him to stretch his brain in order to accommodate and solve almost any problem thus making him effectively a human computer so Reed is a genius with an [[IQ]] of at least 267 at age 16.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Ultimate Reed has a limit to the length he can stretch to, catching the falling [[Carol Danvers]] after being dropped by the Silver Surfer, to which he admits that it hurt him to stretch that far.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #44. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Ultimate Reed experiences an increase in his intellect from the accident that empowered him, making his "mind as flexible as his body". He has shown a reduced need for sleep due to the hyper-efficient workings of his brain.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultimate Reed's body has been radically transformed, his only internal organ being a "bacterial stack" that generates energy to fuel his body.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> This obviates the need to explain, for example, how his [[circulatory system]] can pump his blood when his body is stretched the length of a football field; he simply has none. Lacking a digestive system, he has no need to eat or drink. Similarly, because he has no lungs, Ultimate Reed does not need to breathe in any conventional human sense and can survive in environments lacking oxygen; during his time in the N-Zone, where the atmosphere is essentially acid and contains [[anti-matter]], he is able to survive.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ultimate Reed is extremely durable, surviving a nova flame attack from the [[Alternative_versions_of_the_Human_Torch#Ultimate_Marvel|Johnny Storm]], ionic attacks from the [[Alternative_versions_of_the_Thing#Ultimate_Marvel|Ben Grimm]] and having his brain blown up by [[Alternative_versions_of_Invisible_Woman#Ultimate_Marvel|Susan Storm]]'s force fields.<ref>''Ultimate Doomsday''</ref> The Maker can split himself into multiple sentient beings that can operate separately from one another.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates'' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret War]], The Maker was split into an infinite number of beings by the [[Molecule Man]] who placed one version of the Maker in each of the newly formed universes being created by his Earth-616 counterpart and [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]. Each of these versions shares the same consciousness, allowing them to operate independently. This also enables him to teleport by switching between different versions of himself from different universes, and to transport weapons from other universes, which makes it difficult to disarm him.<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' Vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Brashear fields can be used to block his access to other dimensions.

==Other versions==
During the "Eternity War" arc, an alternate version of the Maker (sharing the same consciousness as the one imprisoned by the New Avengers) arrives on [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] to collaborate with [[High Evolutionary]] to "evolve the entire multiverse".<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' Vol. 2 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Maker uses the High Evolutionary's machinery to destroy the Superflow that keeps the different universes separate, merging them into one reality to help Eternity fight the First Firmament.<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' Vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also uses the machine to revive the Earth-1610 Ultimates ([[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]], [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]], [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]], Wasp and Hulk) in case anyone tries to reverse his universal fusion.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' Vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Earth-616's version of Ultimates arrive on Counter-Earth to confront Maker (who has made it easier for the First Firmament to "digest" Eternity), Maker doesn't believe them and orders the Earth-1610 Ultimates to attack. As both versions of Ultimates conclude that there is no reason to fight each other, Maker kills Ultimate Captain America for disobeying his orders. After having been frozen by [[Monica Rambeau|Spectrum]] and shattered by the High Evolutionary, both Ultimates help Eternity to defeat the First Firmament. Afterwards, the Earth-1610 Ultimates pursue the Makers across the universe.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #100. Marvel Comics.</ref>
