'''Bolivar Trask''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a military scientist whose company Trask Industries is well known as the creator of the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. He is also the father of [[Larry Trask (comics)|Larry Trask]] and [[Madame Sanctity]].

The character was portrayed by [[Bill Duke]] in [[X-Men: The Last Stand]] and by [[Peter Dinklage]] in [[X-Men: Days of Future Past]].

==Publication history==
Bolivar Trask was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #14 (November 1965).

==Fictional character biography==
Bolivar Trask was an anthropologist who saw the rise of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] as a threat to humanity. Bolivar was the father of [[Larry Trask (comics)|Larry Trask]], ironically revealed to be a mutant [[precognition|precognitive]]. Bolivar had realized this, and gave his son a medallion which suppresses his power.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #59 (1969)</ref> Bolivar is also the father of Tanya, a mutant whose ability to travel through time causes her to vanish but is rescued by [[Rachel Summers]] in a far future and become a part of the [[Askani]] under the alias [[Madame Sanctity]].{{issue|date=December 2012}} Tanya's travels through time would result in property damage to Trask's land. This mysterious situation would only further cement his attitudes.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Bolivar decides that humanity has to fight back against the mutants and develops robotic guardians for humanity, known as the Sentinels. Larry was shielded from the Sentinels' ability to detect mutants due to the medallion Bolivar had given his son. Bolivar publishes articles on the threat of mutants. One of these articles showed an illustration of mutant overlords keeping humans as slaves. This illustration would become a symbol for human/mutant relations and several years later [[Quentin Quire]] and his [[Omega Gang]] would base their appearance on this picture.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

[[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] invites Trask for a public debate on human/mutant relations. Xavier argues that mutants are just like humans and not evil, but that does not convince Trask revealing the Sentinels. But Trask and his scientists had apparently created a too adaptive, open-ended tactical/strategic programming, and as a result the Sentinels turn against him, claiming that they were superior to humans. The Sentinels left with Trask and brought him to his first creation, the [[Master Mold]], who orders him to construct more Sentinels.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #15 (1965)</ref>

To stop the Sentinels, Xavier summons the [[X-Men]]. The X-Men fight the Sentinels, but [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] is captured. To reveal the X-Men's secrets, the Sentinels tell Trask to use a device to read Beast's mind. Trask discovers that the X-Men were mutants protecting humanity and realizes that he had been wrong. He helps the X-Men defeat the Sentinels by sacrificing himself to destroy the Sentinel's base.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #16 (1965)</ref>

Recently in [[X-Force]], [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] having been reactivated by the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] has apparently resurrected Bolivar Trask through use of a Technarch to be part of a team of the world's foremost mutant killers. He was apparently given credit for the deaths of all mutants, being the inventor of the Sentinels, had the highest record of mutant kills: 16,521,618.<ref>''X-Force'' (3rd series) #03 (2008)</ref> Consistent with the remorse he had displayed at the time of his death, Trask killed himself after escaping Bastion's mental control.<ref>''X-Factor '' #206</ref>

==Legacy==
Bolivar Trask's death would not be the end of the Sentinels:

* Master Mold would return and Bolivar's son [[Larry Trask (comics)|Larry Trask]], still unaware of his own mutant status (who had prophetic dreams), would follow in his father's footsteps and create new Sentinels to avenge his father.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' 57-59</ref>
* Later, Bolivar's nephew '''Donald Trask III''' would be recruited by the villain [[Cassandra Nova]] to gain control of a group of Sentinels in [[Ecuador]]. The machines, now varying in size, will not harm Trask DNA. They obey Donald's orders. However, once Nova is done copying all of Donald's DNA, Nova kills Donald and takes over the robots.<ref>''New X-Men'' #114-115</ref>
* Bolivar Trask has a brother named '''Simon Trask''', the founder of [[Humanity's Last Stand]].<ref>Uncanny X-Men Annual 1995</ref>

==Other versions==

==="Age of Apocalypse"===
In the 1995 storyline "[[Age of Apocalypse]]", Bolivar Trask married [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira Kinross]] and together they designed heavily armed Sentinels to fight Apocalypse. These Sentinels were better programmed and even capable of reasoning with mutants if they protected humans (their primary objective). Bolivar participates in a plan to bomb North American Apocalypse forces, though this would mean extensive civilian deaths.{{issue|date=May 2014}} He returns in the 2012 launched ''Age of Apocalypse'' ongoing series, as one of the leaders of the remaining human resistance. His daughter Francesca is a main operative in the [[X-Terminators]] (code-named "Fiend") alongside [[William Stryker|Prophet]], [[Donald Pierce|Good Night]], [[Graydon Creed|Horror Show]], and Zora Risman aka DeadEye though she and Bolivar have a rocky relationship.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Civil War: House of M''===
In the 2008 miniseries ''[[Civil War: House of M]]'', Bolivar Trask is sworn in as the Vice-President of the U.S.A. and creates Sentinels to fight against Magneto in his rise to power.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #3 (January, 2009)</ref> Magneto confronts him on board the Helicarrrier. Trask summons Sentinels in self-defense, but they go into non-lethal mode as the ship is staffed with humans. Trask over-rides this, causing the death of many SHIELD agents. Magneto then throws Trask into a Sentinel beam, causing his disintegration.<ref>''[[Civil War: House of M]]'' #5 (March 2009)</ref>

===''X-Men Noir''===
In the 2009 - 2010 miniseries ''[[X-Men Noir]]'', Bolivar Trask is a multitalented doctor of anthropology, and sociology, who is also a [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] sci-fi writer, and a public proponent of [[eugenics]], though not a racist, as his leading characters possess the "finest" qualities of different ethnic groups. He is the writer of the pulp sci-fi series, "The Sentinels", about a race of genetically superior beings in the year 2013 who protect humanity from the grisly deformed "Mutants". His characters include [[Steven Lang (comics)|Stephen Lang]], creator of the Sentinels; [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], leader of inadequates/muties; sentinel commander [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], perfect sentinels [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] and [[Rachel Summers|Rachel]] as well as the mad Egyptian [[Apocalypse (comics)|En Sabah Nur]].{{issue|date=May 2014}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Bolivar Trask is featured in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' as the architect for the US Government '[[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel Initiative]]', a response to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s terrorist attacks on Capitol Hill. Initially, the Sentinels patrolled [[Los Angeles]] and then [[New York City]], destroying any human containing mutant genes. However, these attacks ceased after the X-Men rescued the President's daughter from the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. He discovered the [[Savage Land]]'s location, and dispatched to destroy Magneto's paradise by order from the [[President of the United States]]. This proved to be a foolish move when Magneto easily reprogrammed the chromium-built machines to destroy humankind. After a subsequent Sentinel attack on [[Washington, D.C.]], the Sentinel Initiative was shut down.{{issue|date=May 2014}} He has recently appeared in the Sentinels story arc of ''Ultimate X-Men'', revealed as being employed by the [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris twins]] to build the new Sentinels currently attacking mutants. This would suggest that the government no longer employs him, perhaps due to the failure of the Sentinel Initiative. Feeling horrified by all that he has done, he allows himself, during [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]]'s attempted saving, to drop into the heart of an explosion and is killed.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #87</ref>

Another iteration of the character is also featured in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' as the employer that stole the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|cancer cure project]] created by Edward Brock Sr. and [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]]. Because of being more interested in military applications, he deliberately crashed a plane carrying Edward, Richard and Mary Parker just to gain full control of his employees' project (which is legally his property). Trask later hires [[Silver Sable]] and the [[Wild Pack]] to capture Venom ([[Eddie Brock|Eddie Brock Jr.]]) to experiment onto with [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Dr. Adrian Toomes]]'s help, however, the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] abruptly breaks into Trask's facility which allows Venom to escape.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #128 (January 2009)</ref> The story continues in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game. He and Toomes attempt to re-create the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] suit. To do that, Trask hires Silver Sable and the Wild Pack to once again capture Eddie Jr. and later Peter Parker. After Peter is freed from the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] symbiote, Venom goes after Trask. Upon [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] confronting Bolivar about info on Richard (and obtaining the files), Venom attacks with Bolivar making way to a helicopter...which he doesn't know how to operate. Spider-Man had to fight Venom to save Trask. Trask is later arrested by the arriving S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and later confronted in an offshore prison by Brock. Venom finally kills Trask off-screen for what he made Venom do.

===Television===
* Bolivar Trask appeared in the 1990s [[X-Men animated series|animated series]], voiced by [[Brett Halsey]]. This version is the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]' creator and co-conspired with [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] and [[Cameron Hodge]] against mutants. But when [[Master Mold]] endangers [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]]'s life, he ultimately sacrifices himself to destroy his creation but survived unlike his comic book counterpart.
* Colonel Bolivar Trask appeared in ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'', voiced by [[John Novak]]. This version is a former member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and a noted [[anthropologist]] and cyberneticist studying the process of [[genetic mutation]]. Trask concluded the mutants would one day replace [[human]]s as the dominant [[species]] on [[Earth]] if left unchecked. He decided to prevent this by designing an army of [[robot]]ic guardians who would apprehend mutant kind. In "Day of Reckoning" Pt. 1, he kidnapped [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] as a test subject for his Sentinel prototype. The Sentinel was able to defeat Wolverine. After his Sentinel prototype was destroyed and the [[X-Men]] were cleared, Trask was arrested and placed in prison. In "Uprising", S.H.I.E.L.D. superiors release Trask from prison so that he can continue his Sentinel project under [[Nick Fury]]'s supervision so that the world would be ready for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s threat.
* Bolivar Trask appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. In "Thieves Gambit", he is shown as a scientist working for Senator Kelly alongside Dr. Sybil Zane on the Sentinel Program's creation. Though the building it was being developed in was destroyed in a fight with Wolverine and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], Bolivar and Dr. Zane escaped. In "Badlands", Trask ran a laboratory that Wolverine, [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] infiltrated. When Wolverine ended up captured, Bolivar figured out about the mutant's adamantium skeleton, resulting in [[Nimrod (comics)|advanced-type Sentinels]] that the future X-Men encountered 20 years later. In "Backlash", Trask had managed to create Master Mold to create the Sentinels. He was with Senator Kelly, Warren Worthington II and Dr. Zane when they watch the Sentinels fight the X-Men and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. In "Foresight", Trask ends up launching the Sentinels to [[Genosha]] under orders from Mystique (disguised as Senator Kelly) and later gets knocked out by Mystique.
* Trask Industries is mentioned in the 2017 live-action series ''[[The Gifted (U.S. TV series)|The Gifted]]'' as well as operating the Hound Program under [[Ahab (comics)|Roderick Campbell]] and develop Sentinel Services.

===Film===

* Bolivar Trask was included in the first draft for the 2000 film ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', written by [[Andrew Kevin Walker]], but had to be removed for the film to be greenlit by the studio.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Andrew Kevin Walker]] | title = X-Men First Draft | publisher = Simplyscripts | date = June 7, 1994| url = http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/x-men_walker3.html | accessdate=July 13, 2007}}</ref>
* The character appears in the 2006 film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', played by [[Bill Duke]]. This version is African American and is the head of the [[Department of Homeland Security]].<ref>Hoare, James (May 14, 2014). [http://www.scifinow.co.uk/news/bryan-singer-hopes-youll-forget-x-men-continuity-errors/ "X-Men: Days Of Future Past director Bryan Singer talks X-Men continuity"]. SciFi Now.</ref> He is now considered a different character from the character that appears in the later films.{{cn|date=December 2017}}
* Trask Industries is alluded in the mid-credits scene of the 2013 film ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]''. As [[Professor X]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] warn [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] of an upcoming threat to mutant-kind, a television at an airport security checkpoint displays an ad for Trask Industries.
* Bolivar Trask appears as the main antagonist in the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' portrayed by [[Peter Dinklage]]. In the film, Trask learns of mutants' existence from Charles Xavier's dissertation from [[Oxford University]], provoking him to seek harnessing mutant powers for his weapon-making agendas as well as creating the Sentinel program. He does not seem to have a personal hatred for mutants, and views them as a means to bring about world peace by uniting humanity against a 'common enemy'. This leads some to view him as insane and callous. [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] discovers Trask conducts inhumane and fatal experiments on mutants, including some of the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. In the original timeline, Mystique kills Trask in retaliation, resulting in both his martyrdom and a dystopian future where [[Nimrod (comics)|more advanced versions]] of Sentinels have pushed both mutants and humans to the brink of extinction. The film revolves around the X-Men having the time-displaced Wolverine rally the younger versions of Xavier and Magneto to prevent this future from coming to pass. They are able to spare Trask from his 'original' death, but the ensuing fight as Magneto tries to kill Mystique to ensure that she cannot have another chance to kill Trask later, resulted in Magneto, Mystique and the younger version of [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] being witnessed fighting in public, prompting President Richard Nixon to approve of Trask's Sentinel program. At the subsequent unveiling, Trask is again targeted by Mystique, this time the event attacked by Magneto having laced the prototype Sentinels with metal to turn them against their creators. Mystique stops Magneto's attack and prepares to kill Trask, and stops only when Xavier persuades Mystique to stand down via telepath conversation. By doing this and sparing Trask, history is rewritten: Mystique's stopping Magneto's attack and leaving without causing further harm becomes a convincing demonstration to the world that not all mutants are against humanity, and the U.S. cancels the Sentinel program. At the end of the film, a newspaper article states that Trask was arrested for attempting to sell his Sentinel designs to foreign countries. A mid-credits scene in the ''Rogue Cut'' shows Trask incarcerated inside the cell that once held Magneto underneath the Pentagon.

===Video games===

In the game's continuity, worklogs accessed by the player as they search his base reveal that Trask initially did not have anything against mutants and simply took part in the Sentinel project for the scientific value. However, after witnessing a violent incident which involved a mutant test subject, he came to see mutants as a menace, believing that humanity could only be protected if mutants were eliminated, describing them as freaks of nature. He is seen in the future epilogue of the game in which the Sentinels rule the Earth (a la [[Days of Future Past]]). Notably in the game, he loses his left hand to Wolverine (similar to the losing of [[Weapon X]]'s [[Professor Thorton]]'s right hand) requiring Trask's handprint to get through a door in the facility that he is searching, only to have it replaced with a cybernetic hand in the future.
