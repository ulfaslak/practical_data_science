==Publication history==
Belova, the second modern [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] after [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Natasha Romanova]] (Natasha Romanoff), was initially a post-Soviet [[Russia]]n spy of the [[GRU]]. She debuted briefly in ''[[Inhumans]]'' vol. 2, #5 (March 1999), and was fully introduced in the 1999 Marvel Knights mini-series ''Black Widow''. A second miniseries, also titled ''Black Widow'' and featuring Natasha Romanoff and Daredevil, followed in 2001. The next year, she did a solo turn in her own three-issue miniseries, also titled ''Black Widow'' (officially ''Black Widow: Pale Little Spider'' in the series' [[United States Postal Service|postal]] [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]]) under the mature-audience [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] imprint. The June to August 2002 story arc, by writer [[Greg Rucka]] and artist [[Igor Kordey]], was a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to the story of her becoming the second modern Black Widow, in events preceding her ''Inhumans'' appearance.<ref name="CBRrevisit">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/revisiting-marvels-beezer-belova/|title=Revisiting Marvel's Beezer &amp; Belova|last=De Blieck Jr.|first=Augie|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date= July 16, 2013|accessdate=June 16, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616051339/https://www.cbr.com/revisiting-marvels-beezer-belova/|archivedate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Belova is an [[Amorality|amoral]] [[espionage|spy]] and [[assassination|assassin]] who was trained at the [[Red Room (comics)|Red Room]] by the same spymasters who trained [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]], the first Black Widow. After the death of her trainer, Pyotr Vasilievich Starkovsky, she is activated as the new Black Widow and deployed to investigate. She apprehends and eliminates his killer, unaware that both his murder and the investigation were part of a ploy to get Belova to assert herself as the new Black Widow.<ref>''Black Widow: Pale Little Spider'' #3 (August 2002)</ref> Believing herself to be the rightful successor to the title of "Black Widow", Yelena enthusiastically volunteers for a mission that will put her at odds with Natasha, although the meeting and confrontations between the two do not lead to a decisive battle. Natasha refers to Yelena as "little one" and "russkiya", meaning "Russian", and encourages her to find what makes her unique and her personal identity rather than blindly devote herself to her nation. Natasha later subjects Yelena to a cruel-but-necessary manipulation in order to shatter her illusions about the "Black Widow" title and teach her the reality of the espionage industry.<ref>''Black Widow'' vol. 1, #1-3 (June - August 1999)</ref> Belova eventually retires to Cuba, where she becomes a successful businesswoman and model.<ref>''Black Widow 2'' vol. 1, #1 (November 2005)</ref>

She is lured back, however, by the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and becomes involved in the agency's mining of [[vibranium]] in the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[Savage Land]].<ref>''New Avengers'' vol 1, #5 (April 2005)</ref> Shortly afterward, she barely survives an attack by [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]], receiving severe burns and being subsequently approached with an offer for revenge against S.H.I.E.L.D. and the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].<ref>''New Avengers'' vol 1, #6 (June 2005)</ref>

Belova is genetically altered by the terrorist organization [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], as she had suffered debilitating and disfiguring injuries after her last encounter with the New Avengers in the Savage Land. HYDRA recruited her with the prospect of revenge and after hiring the services of A.I.M. transferred her mind into a new version of '''[[Super-Adaptoid]]'''. This body appeared as Belova had originally until it began to absorb powers, at which time it changed as the original did, though now yellow in color. Now equipped with the ability to copy all of the New Avengers' powers, she engages the superhero team in combat. She is eventually defeated by a combination of Tony Stark's 49<!--# per Stark in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #530 or 531--> successive [[Iron Man]] armors—from the first, ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #39, to the then-current—and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry's]] use of his [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Void]] persona, which she absorbs with the rest of the Sentry's powers and energy. When she is defeated, HYDRA disables her using a remote self-destruct mechanism they had implanted in her, rather than let her reveal intelligence to the New Avengers.<ref name="SP">''New Avengers Annual'' vol 1, #1 (June 2006)</ref>

She has returned working with a vigilante group, the [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)#Vanguard|Vanguard]].<ref>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' vol. 2, #5 (March 2008)</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Quasimodo researched Yelena Belova for [[Norman Osborn]].<ref>''Dark Reign Files'' vol 1, #1 (April 2009)</ref> Yelena Belova appeared to join Osborn's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 1, #128 (March 2009)</ref> However it was eventually revealed to be actually [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Natasha Romanova]] in disguise, acting as a double agent for [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 1, #134 (July 2009)</ref> She believed she was disguised as Belova on Fury's behalf, planted for Osborn to find and invite into the Thunderbolts. However, Osborn revealed to her that he had tricked her into taking on Belova's appearance in order to get her to do his dirty work.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 1, #135 (September 2009)</ref> After Natasha's escape from the Thunderbolts, Osborn then revealed the true Yelena in stasis to [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Scourge]] and warned him that she could be his replacement on the team.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 1, #136 (September 2009)</ref>

The real Yelena is later freed from stasis by members of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] who install the female Adaptoid on the High Council of A.I.M. (alongside [[Andrew Forson]], [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], Jude the Entropic Man, [[Mentallo]], [[Superia]], and an undercover [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]) as the Minister of State in [[Bagalia]] (a country populated by supervillains).<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2, #2 (March 2013)</ref>

After the death of the original Black Widow at the hands of [[Captain America]]'s Hydra doppelganger then defeat at hands of the real Captain America in ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'', Yelena began to reassume the Black Widow identity once again, but now to honor the late-Natasha. Sometimes during the world's restoration from Hydra's mess, Yelena travels around the world to assassinate the world's infamous generals and remaining Hydra's remnants, which caught the attentions of Natasha's former lovers, [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Secret Empire: Omega'' vol. 1, #1 (September 2017)</ref><ref>''Tales of Suspense'' vol. 1, #100 - #101 (December - January, 2018 - 2019)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Black Widow is in peak athletic condition. She also has extensive military, martial arts, and espionage training.<ref>''Black Widow'' vol. 1, #1 (June 1999)</ref>

As a Super-Adaptoid, she was mutated by material synthesized from the Super-Adaptoid where she could adapt the powers of anyone around her like [[Luke Cage]], [[Iron Man]], [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in rapid succession.<ref name="SP" />

Upon [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Man]] arriving, the two [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] helped Natasha to fight Yelena, Strucker and Winter Hulk until Yelena later goes against Strucker's orders. While Captain America and Iron Man fought to keep Winter Hulk from reaching a civilian location where a HYDRA base is, Natasha continues to fight with Yelena even when she activated the Red Room's mind-controlled washouts. But Romanova disables the mind-controlled Red Room washouts and Yelena is personally defeated yet managed to get away.
