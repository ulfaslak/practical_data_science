'''Knull''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (Cletus Kasady)|Carnage]]. The character is depicted as an evil [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|deity]], who created the weapon known as All-Black the Necrosword and the alien races known as the [[Klyntar]] and Exolons. The character would go on and have more major role in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
The character was first introduced as an nameless being in ''Thor: God of Thunder'' #6, before making his full appearance in ''Venom'' #3. The character would be mentioned in various issues of ''[[Venom (comic book)|Web of Venom]]'', ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and "[[War of the Realms]]".

After that, Knull was revealed to be the antagonist in Donny Cates’ ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]: Black'' #1.

==Fictional character biography==
Knull was a [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|primordial deity]], who existed before the universe itself and was content to drift through the endless void of space, until the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] arrived to "evolve" the universe. Knull, seeing that his endless void was being touched, created All-Black the Necrosword and decapitated one of the Celestials. Seeing this, the other Celestials banished Knull and the severed head deeper into the Void. He then used the head to forge the symbiote and combined it with the cosmic energies of the head, which would eventually become [[Knowhere]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1022604840051109888|title = Yep! The severed celestial head in VENOM #4 would someday erode and decay and become Knowhere! Good catch!|last = Cates|first = Donny|publisher = [[Twitter]]|date = 26 July 2018 |website = twitter.com|accessdate = 27 July 2018}}</ref> In doing so, he unintentionally gave the symbiote its weaknesses to sonic attacks and fire. He created a symbiote armor and, with All-Black, started killing the other [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|deities]], until he crash landed on an unnamed planet where [[Gorr (comics)#Gorr the God Butcher|Gorr]] took All-Black and incapacitated Knull.<ref>''Thor God of Thunder'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Knull eventually reawakened and discovered he could bond his living abyss to "lesser creatures" and control their new form as vessels. He created an army of symbiotes with himself in the center of the hive mind and uses them to spread over the universe, establishing the Symbiote Imperium and killing the light and creation in the process.

He continued killing Gods, while also enslaving others whom he spared with the use of his abyss. At some point, he was approached by the time displaced [[Silver Surfer]], who had been weakened after the Surfer had created a little star in order to free a world from Knull's control. After a brief fight, Knull was able to bond a symbiote to the Surfer, but the latter was saved by [[Ego, the Living Planet]].<ref>''Silver Surfer: Black'' #1-2. Marvel Comics</ref> 

When one dragon-like symbiote composite arrived on medieval Earth to claim the planet as part of the Symbiote Imperium, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] arrived in aid of the Viking villagers and defeated the dragon, which the villagers called "Grendel," causing the connection between Knull and the symbiote hivemind to break. The symbiotes over the universe, now free from Knull's control, began bonding to benevolent hosts and learning about the [[Divine light|Light]]. The Symbiotes rebelled against their god and trapped him inside an artificial planet formed of thousands of symbiotes, which they called called Klyntar — "cage" in their language.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After thousands of years,  [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] discovered the body of the Grendel and bound the pieces of the dragon to soldiers in order to create Super-Soldiers to fight in the [[Vietnam War]]. The procedure was dubbed the [[Weapon Plus#Weapon V|Sym-Soldier program]]. This reawakened Knull, allowing him to take control of the Sym-soldiers who went rogue before being captured by [[Nick Fury]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]], except one piece, named Rex, which escaped Knull's control.<ref>''Web of Venom Ve'nam'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Years later, [[Eddie Brock]] ([[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]) unknowingly freed the dragon and, after a battle against Eddie and [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]], the dragon began searching for Rex in order to free Knull.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Venom merged with Rex and eventually trapped the Grendel in a blast furnace, incinerating it and Rex both.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #5-6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterward, the Maker and Project Oversight retrieve the Grendel's codex from the furnace.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''Carnage Born'', it is revealed that, when [[Cletus Kasady]] died at birth, he came in contact with Knull, who revived Cletus in order to  free Knull from the Klyntar. After [[Scorn (Marvel Comics)|Scorn]] formed a [[cult]] worshiping Knull, they stole the codices of Grendel and Cletus' damaged body and, after implanting the codices inside Cletus, the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage symbiote]]'s codex is absorbed by Grendel, causing Grendel to become god-like. After the contact with Knull, Cletus decided to free Knull by collecting every codex of every host who had at some point bonded to symbiotes in order to overload the symbiote hive mind and scatter the Klyntar.<ref>''Web of Venom Carnage Born'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It's also revealed that Knull had also created the Exolons—parasites that attach to a host, while feeding on their soul. [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Zak-Del]], whose body houses Exolon, plans to find Knull in order for the latter to remove the parasite from him.<ref>''Guardians of Galaxy'' Vol 5 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Cletus reunited with [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], they reformed the cult dedicated in worshiping Knull and returned to Doverton, Colorado, where they got the codices from the citizens and animals who were infected by Carnage during ''Carnage USA''.<ref>''Web of Venom Cult of Carnage'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{See|Symbiote (comics)#Powers and abilities}}
Knull is a [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|primordial deity]], having super strength, agility, immortality<ref>{{cite tweet |user= Doncates|number= 1120132305777983489|date= 21 April 2019|title= Nothing can kill Knull}}</ref> and healing factor. He possesses Supreme Umbrakinesis, as he can manifest darkness to create weapons and creatures, whom he calls the "Living Abyss", which he can control and also augment their power which allowed Venom to unlock new abilities and also allowed one of Knull's dragon to be unaffected by the symbiotes' classic weaknesses and to be as fast as the Silver Surfer. He also possesses limited shapeshifting ability, including the ability to turn his human-like mouth into fanged jaws with an elongated tongue — this feature was passed on to the symbiotes. He's also an expert combatant, utilizing All-Black to kill [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] and other [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|gods]], while wearing an armor made from symbiote with a red dragon and spiral emblem, which was based on Spiral of [[Carcosa]] from the ''[[True Detective]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stegmanandfriends.podbean.com/e/venom-boiz-wdonny-cates-venom-1-q-and-a//|title=VENOM BOIZ! w/Donny Cates: Venom (2018) #1 Director’s Commentary|date=22 June 2019}}</ref>

Despite his connection to the symbiotes being severed, his influence can still be seen such when Gorr, [[Galactus#King Thor|Old Galactus]],<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #24.

Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Thor'' Vol. 5 #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> Venom formed a similar emblem with mixed design of Knull's emblem and [[Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter)|Spider-Woman]]'s.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #8.

==Other versions==
In [[Ultimate Marvel]], [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]] and [[List of Marvel Comics characters: B#Carl Brock|Eddie Brock Sr.]], were the ones who created the [[Ultimate Venom|Venom suit]] with Richard's DNA as a cure for cancer.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #33.
