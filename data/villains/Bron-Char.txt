In addition to being an expert at hand-to-hand combat, he jokes about finding Korath attractive. Bron-Char is first seen when he and Starforce head to look for a compromised Kree scout named Soh-Larr. This leads to an ambush by a faction of the Skrulls led by Talos which ends with Vers getting captured. After Vers escapes to Earth and contacts Yon-Rogg, Bron-Char accompanies Starforce and some Kree soldiers in their trip to Earth where it was discovered that [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]] hid some Skrull refugees on her ship. After Carol Danvers fights the [[Supreme Intelligence]]'s control and burns out the implant that limits her abilities, she fights Starforce and subdues Bron-Char.
