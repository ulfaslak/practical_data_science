'''Tombstone''' ('''Lonnie Thompson Lincoln''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A hulking [[albino]] man with filed teeth, Tombstone is a notorious crime boss in [[New York City]]. He is primarily an enemy of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and the father of [[Janice Lincoln]].

The character has appeared in various media including two animated series (''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''), and the animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' with his voice provided by [[Krondon|Marvin "Krondon" Jones III]].

==Publication history==
[[File:Tombstone comic.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Tombstone on the cover of ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #139.<br>Art by [[Sal Buscema]].]]
The character was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Alex Saviuk]] and first appeared in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #36 (March 1988). The character was immediately established to have a history with longtime Spider-Man [[supporting character]] [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], and was brought on as a regular in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', which was then being written by Conway. Conway explained why he created Tombstone: "My general motivation was a need to work with the characters who weren't central to ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' title, since that was the main book. That meant I needed to focus my attention not on [[Aunt May]] or [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]], or even [[J. Jonah Jameson]], but on second- or even third-tier supporting characters. Joe Robertson was one of those. The second motive had to do with my desire to bring back the ruthless gangster [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] had been, but not Hammerhead himself. It just came to me as a character type. One thing led to another, and as his backstory expanded, readers responded well to it."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 17|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Born as Lonnie Thompson Lincoln in [[Harlem]], in [[New York City]], he started out as troubled youth who was bullied by his peers because he was Harlem's only [[African Americans|African-American]] [[Albinism|albino]]. Taller and stronger than the other children, he became a school bully, extorting [[protection money]] from his classmates. The school newspaper, edited by [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], was going to run a story on Lonnie's activities, but pulled it when Lonnie used scare tactics to intimidate Robertson. Lonnie allowed his personal demons to direct the course of his life and he turned to a life of serious crime.{{issue|date=December 2017}} As a [[hitman]] and enforcer, he used his albinism to his advantage. He filed his teeth and nails to points, giving him the appearance of a [[vampire]]. This frequently caught his opponents off-guard, making it easier to kill them. He also lifted weights and engaged in many street fights to hone his fighting skills. One night, Robertson, now working for a local paper, went to meet a source only to see the source being killed by Lincoln. He threatened to kill Robertson if the story was brought out. Robertson kept the secret for over twenty years whilst Lincoln became a powerful mob enforcer, killing many others.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #137. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Now known as "Tombstone" on the street, he returned to New York City as the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s hitman.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref> Tombstone threw the [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] out of the [[Arranger (comics)|Arranger]]'s window.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #38. Marvel Comics.</ref> Tombstone captured a mutant known as the [[Persuader (Marvel Comics)|Persuader]] for the Arranger.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #138. Marvel Comics.</ref> Lonnie returned to Robertson's neighborhood. Eventually Robertson went to the police which resulted in Tombstone's incarceration, but not before Tombstone confronted and seriously injured Robertson, nearly permanently damaging Robertson's spine.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #139. Marvel Comics.</ref> Tombstone then encountered [[Spider-Man]] in Atlanta, Georgia; Tombstone was defeated and sent to the Philadelphia State Penitentiary.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #142. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Robertson was also incarcerated for suppression of evidence. On learning this, Tombstone obtained a transfer to Lewsiburg State Penitentiary where Robertson was incarcerated. In prison, Tombstone killed Robertson's befriended bodyguard Bruiser. Tombstone eventually broke out of prison but was confronted by [[Spider-Man]]; he eluded capture after a harrowing battle in which he nearly beat Spider-Man to death before Robertson stopped him. Tombstone and Robertson were knocked into the Susquehana River.  Tombstone brought a badly-injured Robertson to an Amish family so that Robertson could recover enough to give him a decent fight. When Tombstone finally made his move to kill Robertson in retaliation for turning on him during the fight with Spider-Man, Robertson stabbed Tombstone with a pitchfork and then escaped. Tombstone joined a criminal organization, headed by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], and then saved Robertson from Hobgoblin so that he could kill Robertson himself.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #150, 153, 155, 157, 161. Marvel Comics.</ref> Robertson was then given a full pardon for helping recapture Tombstone.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Tombstone eventually gained a [[superhuman]] physical constitution. Tombstone encountered Robertson at the Osborn Chemical Plant. Robertson shot Tombstone and trapped him in an airtight test chamber which contained an experimental gas. The gas was absorbed into Tombstone's bloodstream and had a mutagenic effect on his body, enhancing his strength and heightening his other physical abilities. Tombstone then called off his vendetta against Robertson in gratitude.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #66-68. Marvel Comics.</ref> Tombstone was later defeated by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Punisher]] while competing against [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] in a real game of [[Assassin (game)|Assassin]] sponsored by the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #292-293.

==Powers and abilities==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
Originally, Lonnie Lincoln had no superhuman powers, but has gained them through artificial means as a result of a mutagenic reaction to an experimental preservative gas absorbed into his bloodstream. He possesses physical strength that has been increased beyond his original limits to superhuman levels. Tombstone's body is highly resistant to physical injury and is capable of withstanding extreme temperatures, great impact forces, high caliber bullets and toxic gases without sustaining injury. His reflexes, speed, and stamina are likewise heightened beyond a range attainable for normal human beings.

Aside from these advantages, he is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with years of street fighting experience and, even before gaining powers, was easily capable of killing someone with his bare hands. He now combines his street-fighting skills with his superhuman strength to create a unique fighting style. He is also highly proficient with conventional firearms and well connected in the underworld of organized crime.

As an albino, Tombstone is sensitive to sunlight due to a natural deficiency of [[melanin]]. He is usually depicted as only being capable of speaking in whispers. However, after the exposure to gas at OsCorp, he has been depicted speaking in tones approaching normal vocal tones.

Tombstone has filed all his teeth into razor-sharp points.

==Other versions==
===MC2===
An older version of Tombstone appears in the ''Spectacular Spider-Girl'' digital comic series, set in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe. He had been paid by [[Silvermane#MC2|Silvermane]] to carry out a hit on [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]]. Despite his advanced years, Tombstone still proved to be a tough opponent to defeat.<ref>[http://marvel.com/digitalcomics/titles/Spectacular_Spider-Girl.2009.3 ]{{dead link|date=August 2019}}</ref>

He met Spider-Girl and did battle with her. But when he saw [[Alternative versions of Venom#Mayhem (April Parker)|another Spider-Girl]] saving people from a burning building on TV, Tombstone grew furious and rapidly finished her off. {{Issue|date=July 2009}}

When Tombstone met the Blue Spider-Girl, he revealed to her that he killed the other Spider-Girl, which caused her to attack him in rage. Tombstone was surprised that she has symbiote powers and was defeated. At first thinking he will be on the streets again soon since he believes heroes cannot kill, the Blue Spider-Girl suffocates and kills him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Marvel Noir===
Tombstone appears in ''[[Luke Cage Noir]]'', as an albino Harlem crime lord.<ref>''Luke Cage Noir'' # 1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Marvel Adventures===
In the ''[[Marvel Adventures]]'' reality, Tombstone is a hired muscle of the Torino crime family. After his fellow mobsters were arrested, Tombstone secretly stole Captain [[George Stacy]]'s cellphone and lured [[Gwen Stacy]] to the subway where he sent the pictures he took of them to George. Spider-Man arrived telling him to get away from Gwen. Tombstone stated that he didn't abduct or harm Gwen and backed away without a fight. When Captain Stacy arrived to arrest Tombstone and his fellow mobsters, Spider-Man and Captain America arrived. It took the combination tactics of Spider-Man, Captain America, and Captain Stacy to defeat Tombstone.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man'' #55. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Secret Wars===
During the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, a version of Tombstone lives in the [[Battleworld]] domain of Arachnia.

Tombstone's revenge attempts on his former childhood friend puts him in regular conflict with [[Spider-Man]] while under the employ of various crime figures (like [[Silvermane]] and [[Richard Fisk]]). 
* Tombstone/L. Thompson Lincoln appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced initially by [[Keith David]] ([[Survival of the Fittest (The Spectacular Spider-Man)|pilot episode]]) and subsequently by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] (subsequent episodes).<ref name="BTVA"/> This version is a calculating and intelligent [[Boss (crime)|crime lord]] known as the "'''[[Big Man (comics)|Big Man]]'''" of crime with the public image of a benevolent wealthy [[philanthropist]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] as a henchman. He hires the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] to take out Spider-Man (first in the pilot and then later personally as the New Enforcers thanks to [[Tinkerer]]). Tombstone then enlists [[Norman Osborn]] to engineer super-villains (such as [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]), and even allows [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] to eliminate their enemy. A gang war later breaks out between Tombstone, [[Doctor Octopus]] and Silvermane over control of New York's underworld, culminating in a summit where his own enforcer pits the three crime lords against each other. After a lengthy battle with Spider-Man, Tombstone is finally defeated and exposed as the Big Man, leading to his arrest. Although he is later let out of prison, he discovers that his Big Man position has been taken over by the Green Goblin, who has manipulated Hammerhead to get Tombstone arrested, so that he could then take over his criminal empire.

===Film===
Tombstone appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', voiced by [[Krondon|Marvin "Krondon" Jones III]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/black-lightning-tobias-whale-tombstone-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse/|title=Black Lightning Star Is a Marvel Crime Boss in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse|last=Zachary|first=Brandon|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=December 1, 2018|accessdate=December 3, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181202222340/https://www.cbr.com/black-lightning-tobias-whale-tombstone-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse/|archivedate=December 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> This version of the character is under the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s employ and acts as his personal bodyguard; he usually wields two pistols, but is shown to also be a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. Tombstone is present when Kingpin unmasks and kills [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]], before ordering Tombstone to dispose of the body. Later, Tombstone accompanies Kingpin and his other henchmen - [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]], and [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] - to attack the spider-people at [[Aunt May]]'s house, in order to retrieve the USB drive that can be used to stop the [[Alchemax]] Super Collider, which Kingpin plans to use to access different dimensions and reunite with an alternate version of his family, after they died in a car crash. In the final battle at the Collider, Tombstone is defeated by [[Spider-Man Noir]], and is later seen being arrested by the police alongside Kingpin and those involved.

===Video games===
* Tombstone appears in ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]].<ref name="BTVA"/>
* Tombstone appears as a side mission [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] in the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game, voiced by Corey Jones.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/7/17819416/spider-man-ps4-villains-guide|title=A guide to the Spider-Man PS4 villains|first=Petrana|last=Radulovic|date=September 7, 2018|website=Polygon}}</ref> This version of the character is a notorious and well-known crime lord in New York City, and a powerful hand-to-hand combatant, but is portrayed as also being the leader of a biker gang, and is bald-headed, wears biker clothes instead of a suit, and his skin is much less visibly white than that of a normal person. The game also provides a different origin for his superhuman powers, having been exposed to a chemical in his youth that hardened and turned his skin white, while also completely eliminating his sense of pain. Because of this, Tombstone is nearly impervious to any form of physical harm; Spider-Man comments that he could punch Tombstone for an entire day and he would still feel nothing, and, on one occasion, Tombstone even goes so far as shooting himelf point-blank in the head to intimidate one of his bikers. Alongside [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Tombstone serves as one of Spider-Man's oldest enemies, having fought him several times during the hero's past eight years career, and, although Spider-Man managed to defeat him numerous times, Tombstone would always escape from prison and return to his life of crime, with the help of his gang. In the main story of the game, [[Mary Jane Watson]] discovers and infiltrates Tombstone's garage during her investigation on the Inner Demons gang led by [[Mister Negative|Martin Li]]. Staying hidden from Tombstone's crew, Mary Jane discovers that they are building some sort of armored vehicle for the Inner Demons (which is later used by Li to steal the Devil's Breath virus), before escaping the garage and telling Spider-Man about it. Later, in a side mission, Spider-Man, with the help of the information provided by Mary Jane, discovers that Tombstone is using Li's money to finance the theft of certain chemicals so he can create "Grave Dust", a drug similar to the one that empowered him that confers temporary invincibility on users. Spider's Man then tracks down Tombstone at his garage and engages him and his goons in a fight. After dispatching of Tombstone's goons, Spider-Man is able to deploy a drug meant to fix Tombstone's condition, which makes him vulnerable enough to bleed and feel pain. Spider-Man eventually defeats Tombstone and, as he leaves him for the police, Tombstone realizes that being "mortal" makes his life of crime more exciting, stating that he can't wait for a rematch with Spider-Man. In his character biography, Spider-Man states that Tombstone sees every loss as "another great challenge on the horizon", and that, amongst all the villains he has fought over the years, Tombstone is one of the hardest to put down, as he loves fighting and never gives up until he's defeated, which is difficult even for Spider-Man to accomplish.
