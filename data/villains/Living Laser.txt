The '''Living Laser''' ('''Arthur Parks''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #34 (November 1966). He would become a recurring enemy of [[Iron Man]] and plays a key role in the end of the "Iron Man: The Inevitable" mini series.

Arthur Parks started out as a scientist that invented small, wrist mounted lasers and used them for criminal pursuits. At one point he was a member of the [[Lethal Legion]] and at another point he was poised to take over the world due to his possession of the [[Serpent Crown]], but is foiled by the Avengers. At one point it appeared that the Living Laser exploded in space, but in reality his body was transformed into [[photon]] form, making him an actual living laser.

==Publication history==
The Living Laser debuted in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #34 (Nov. 1966) as Arthur Parks, a scientist who created wrist-mounted laser units and a costume (writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] stated "Arthur Parks was a scientist sufficiently proficient to design laser projectors small enough to wear on his wrists, quite the achievement in 1966.")<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

Following his appearance in the following issue, the Living Laser resurfaced in ''Avengers King-Size Special'' #1 (Sept. 1967).

The real Laser reappeared in an extended storyline in '' Avengers'' #151 (Sept. 1976); #153 (Nov. 1976) & ''Avengers'' Annual #6 (1976).

After appearing as part of a [[pseudo]] Lethal Legion in ''Avengers'' #164–166 (Nov. 1977 – Jan. 1978), the character returned in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #152–153 (Nov.–Dec. 1981) and ''Iron Man'' #211 (Oct. 1986). The Laser featured in the [[Acts of Vengeance]] storyline in ''Quasar'' #6 (Jan. 1990) and reappeared in a new [[photon]] form in ''Iron Man'' #259–263 (Aug.-Dec. 1990) before returning in ''Quasar'' #30 (Jan. 1992) and ''Iron Man'' #289 (Feb. 1993).

The Living Laser met the Avengers again when he tried to conquer a small South American country, who defeated and incarcerated the villain.<ref>''Avengers'' #34–35 (Nov.–Dec. 1966)</ref>

Discovering that the amplification caused a build-up of energy in his body that is reaching a critical, and potentially fatal, level, the Laser seeks the aid of [[East German]] scientists, who offer to help by draining off the excess energy and using it to power a network of weapons [[satellite]]s. The plan, however, is stopped by [[Iron Man]] and in battle with the hero, the Laser's energy levels build to critical mass. Although the Laser begs for help, Iron Man has no choice but to hurl the character into the [[atmosphere]] where he [[detonate]]s and apparently dies.<ref>''Iron Man'' #152–153 (Nov.–Dec. 1981)</ref> Eventually revived, the Laser battles Iron Man once again;<ref>''Iron Man'' #211 (Oct. 1986)</ref> and during the [[Acts of Vengeance]] storyline battles the hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #6 (Jan. 1990)</ref>

The Laser returns as an employee of the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM)]] villain [[MODOK]],<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11'' #1–5 (Sept. 2007 – Jan. 2008)</ref> and later as a member of the criminal army formed by the villain the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #35 (Oct. 2007)</ref> The villain sides with the heroes during the [[Secret Invasion]] storyline in a pitched battle with the [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] [[Skrull]]s,<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #1–8 (June 2008 – Jan. 2009)</ref> and has a number of encounters with various teams of Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' #46 (Dec. 2008); #50 (April 2009); ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25 & 27 (Aug. & Oct.); #61 (March 2010) & #63 (May 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
A gifted research scientist with expertise in [[laser]] technology and a [[Ph.D]] in physics, Arthur Parks began his criminal career using wrist-mounted laser projection units, and later implants miniature laser [[diode]]s into his skin which absorb energy. With the diode implants, Parks is capable of energy projection, [[light refraction]] for [[invisibility]] and [[illusion]] generation.

Parks's material body is eventually replaced by photons due to an overloading of the diode implants. By increasing the [[density]] of the photons comprising his form, Parks can achieve "solidity", project photons as energy beams, and create [[three-dimensional]] [[holographic]] images. The character also possesses limited telepathic abilities and can [[Speed of light|travel at light speed]].
