==Fictional character biography==
===Family===
[[Image:Tomseanmaeve.png|210px|A young Tom and Sean Cassidy meet Maeve Rourke. Art by [[John Bolton (comics)|John Bolton]].|thumb|left]]
Black Tom was born in [[Dublin]]. He is the cousin of Sean Cassidy, the [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], a member of the [[X-Men]]. He was also once the only friend of the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].

His original principal power was that he could generate blasts of heat through a [[wood]]en medium, such as the [[Shillelagh (weapon)|shillelagh]] that he often carries. He has a rivalry with Sean, mainly because Sean won both Cassidy Keep, their estate, and the family fortune from Tom in a game of dice. They were also rivals for a woman named Maeve Rourke, whom Sean married.

While Sean was away, working for [[INTERPOL]], Maeve gave birth to their daughter, Theresa. Not much later, Maeve died in an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing. With no means to contact Sean, Tom took care of Theresa.

When Sean returned to learn of his wife’s death, he was devastated. Before Tom could even tell him of the existence of his daughter, Sean lashed out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve.

While Sean flew away in anger, Tom fell into a chasm, breaking his leg as a result of the attack, which left him with a limp. Angrily, Tom swore to make Sean pay and vowed to never tell him about his daughter, raising her himself instead.

===Supervillain===
Later Tom became a criminal and came into conflict with the law and was apprehended. While serving time in prison, Tom met and befriended [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. The two became close friends and allies, and worked together on missions. As part of his revenge scheme against Sean, Tom murdered a lawyer ally of Banshee.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #99</ref> Black Tom and Juggernaut then took Banshee and the other X-Men prisoner at Cassidy Keep. He was defeated in a duel by Banshee.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #101-103</ref> Black Tom and Juggernaut next hired [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] to kill the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #122</ref>

Alongside Juggernaut and Theresa (now under the codename [[Siryn]]), Tom went to [[San Francisco]] and stole the USA's entire [[vibranium]] supply. Several X-Men and the original [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] subsequently liberated the vibranium and captured Black Tom and Siryn. Convinced a life of crime was too dangerous for Theresa, Black Tom exonerated her of responsibility for the theft,<ref name="SW">''Spider-Woman'' #37-38</ref> and wrote a letter to Sean explaining who she was.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #148</ref> Juggernaut broke him out of prison the same day.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #38</ref>

Tom next sent the Juggernaut to abduct [[Madame Web]], observing Juggernaut's battle with [[Spider-Man]] from afar.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #229-230</ref> Black Tom was briefly endowed with half the powers of Juggernaut by the Ruby of [[Cyttorak]], and then teamed with Juggernaut against Spider-Man and the X-Men.<ref name="MTU150">''Marvel Team-Up'' #150</ref>

Black Tom next took [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]] and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] hostage on behalf of Arianna Jankos. He used an interdimensional teleporter to return the Juggernaut to Earth. He then battled Siryn and her teammates in [[X-Force]]. [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] shot Tom, and [[Deadpool]] took Tom to [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Mr. Tolliver]].<ref>''X-Force'' #1-5</ref>

===Transformation===
After being shot by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], Tom was taken to [[France]], where doctors grafted a wood-like substance onto his wounds, healing him and allowing him to channel his bio-blasts directly through his fists. Unfortunately, due to a genetic virus the substance spread over Tom's body, and only the mutated cells of the mercenary [[Deadpool]] (due to his healing factor) were able to help Tom stop the spread of the plant growth.<ref name="DPV2I3">''Deadpool, Volume 2'', #3 (1994)</ref> Although the original plan was to capture Deadpool and copy his cells, one of Black Tom's minions managed to sever Deadpool's hand. Its attachment to the stump of Tom's intentionally severed hand was enough to save him.<ref name="DPV2I3" />

The effect of Deadpool's cells did not last for long. The spreading began again, to the point where Tom was completely composed of plant matter. As a result, his powers included control and manipulation of all manner of plant life, to the point where he could make plant doppelgangers of himself, or anyone else. He was completely insane as a result.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}

During this time, Black Tom resurfaced as a member of the latest incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].{{issue|date=May 2012}} Earlier, [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] had infiltrated the X-Men for him as part of the Brotherhood's plan, though Juggernaut slowly changed during his time with the X-Men, mostly due to the positive influence of the young boy [[Sammy Paré]]. Juggernaut rejoined the Brotherhood, secretly planning on turning them when the time was right. Sammy stumbled upon the group, and assuming that Juggernaut was betraying the X-Men, started lashing out. In retaliation Tom brutally murdered the boy, causing Juggernaut to attack Cassidy, dismembering him. Due to Tom's new plantlike physiology, this did not hurt him.<ref>''X-Men'' 163 (2005)</ref>

Juggernaut managed to escape and warn the X-Men, while Black Tom led an attack on the X-Mansion. Besides killing the school's cook, their mission was a failure. In the end [[Xorn]] sucked Black Tom and the rest of the Brotherhood into a [[black hole]].<ref>''X-Men'' 164 (2005)</ref>

===M-Day===
After [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Black Tom woke up as a human again, losing his secondary mutation but possibly still retaining his old powers, along with his sanity. The organization [[Black Air]] hired Tom to attack the new incarnation of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], of which Juggernaut was now a member. Though he easily defeated the others, Juggernaut confronted his former friend and convinced him to turn himself in for the death of Sammy, saying "He was a kid, Tom. An' you an' me, for all our faults, we used ta be better than that."

Tom also showed remorse for killing the child, "That wasn't me, Cain, you know that. I wasn't in my right mind... You've got to understand... that mad life, before... it was like some dream."

===''Deadpool''===
Black Tom reappears in ''[[Deadpool]]'', where he was hired by [[Black Box (comics)|Black Box]] to hunt Deadpool.<ref>''Deadpool'' #58 (2012)</ref>

===X-Men: Blue===
Black Tom resurfaces with the Juggernaut attacking a luxury yacht, but they are confronted by the time-displaced [[All-New X-Men|young X-Men]], with Jean knocking Black Tom out while Beast - who has been training in magic - creates a dimensional portal that passes through Hell before sending Juggernaut to Siberia.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #1</ref>

===Dawn of X===
Thomas was one amongst many within Homo Superior, both heroes & villains alike, whom accepted the invite to the new mutant home nation of [[Krakoa]] on the grounds that all whom call it home forgo any petty rivalries or their criminal ways.<ref>''House of X'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Terms of which that Black Tom'd gratefully accepted; eventually taking a job at internal/external security through a physiological union between himself and the living isle to better articulate his powers. Tragedy would strike while he was on watch however, as mercenaries with Reaver like bioaugments would descend upon the mutant nation by going around they're security systems using flesh samples peeled off the body of one of their own.<ref>''X-force'' Vol. 6 #1 (Nov, 2019)</ref> They quickly began gunning down Krakoan citizens left and right, Tom and many of the X-Men had managed to depose of their assailants, but not before one of them had gunned down Professor X.<ref>''X-force'' Vol. 6 #2 (Nov, 2019)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Black Tom was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] whose principal power was the ability to generate and discharge [[concussive]] blasts of force and heat through any wooden medium. He typically carried a [[Shillelagh (weapon)|shillelagh]], a traditional [[Ireland|Irish]] wooden fighting stick, which he used as a focus for his power. He was immune to [[Banshee (comics)#Powers and abilities|Banshee's sonic powers]], as the two cousins' powers cancel each other out on contact.

Black Tom is a good hand-to-hand combatant, and skilled with bladed weapons:  he has carried a sword and battle-axe on occasion. He is also a master of terrorist strategies and tactics.

Black Tom very briefly possessed the powers of the Juggernaut at half their full might.<ref name="MTU150"/>

Later, his [[physiology]] and [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] were radically changed, and he became a humanoid plant form capable of living in several different bodies and infecting foliage and trees to make them a part of his body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #410</ref> This made him difficult to restrain or destroy because it was nearly impossible to destroy every part of his body, as much of it could be kept underground.<ref>''Generation X'' Vol. 1 #25 (March, 1997)</ref> Because he could invade other plants with his life force he could assimilate them into himself adding the excess plant mass to his own body.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #164 (Jan, 2005)</ref>

Through this Secondary Mutation, Thomas also had the ability to generate plantlike clones of himself and/or others. Even recreating their powers like he done through a clone of Mondo he'd been controlling for months.<ref>''Generation X'' Vol. #1 (Nov, 1994)</ref> 

While in his plant form, he was also able to directly supplant a person's physical motor skills by latching vines/coils directly into their nervous system to hotwire their motor skills.<ref>''Generation X'' Vol. 1 #25 (March, 1997)</ref> These specialized tendrils could also be used to [[siphon]] off the life energy of living beings by sending them into living [[body cavity|body cavities]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 1 #411 (Oct, 2002)</ref> However, the process seemed to have affected his mind, and he was not in full control of himself.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 1 #412 (Nov, 2002)</ref>

After M-Day, in which most mutants lost their powers, he lost his [[secondary mutation|alterations]] and his human form was restored,<ref>''New Excalibur'' #7</ref> though he has since demonstrated both his bio-blast and tree control powers.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol 2 #59</ref> Thomas also leaned to channel energy through his walking stick in different ways, either creating an energy barrier or increasing its bludgeoning power if need be.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

Having come to Krakoa, the new mutant homeland for all Homo Superior, Cassidy has gained new powers and abilities reminiscent of those he lost as part Decimation. Black Tom now has a deep gestalt link with the living island and can focus his mutant power through its facilities, with Krakoa's sentient landmass now serving as an extension of his own skillset. Broadening his senses beyond physical and visual reach, giving him control over its topographic and geographic landscaping, such as causing earthquakes, raising stone bedding, making trees collapse and altering plants and foliage to attack adversaries.<ref>''X-force'' Vol. 6 #1-2 (Nov, 2019)</ref>

==Other versions==
===X-Men Noir===
"Blackie" Cassidy is depicted as an Irish drug dealer with ties to the Brotherhood, a secret society of corrupt police officers and detectives.<ref>''X-Men Noir'' #1. December 2008</ref>

Cassidy is referenced to be a contact of Ultimate [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] in [[Ultimate X-Men]] and is said to be an Irish arms dealer.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #53</ref>
===Days of Future Past===
Black Tom is mentioned in thought by [[Rachel Summers]] as having been alive [[Days of Future Past|in her original timeline]], where the Juggernaut shared the power of the Cyttorak Jewel with him and they assisted the mutant resistance in their fight against the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] for a time.<ref name="MTU150"/>

==In other media==
===Television===
Black Tom appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episodes "Phoenix Saga (Part 3): The Cry of the Banshee" and "Phoenix Saga (Part 4): The Starjammers".

===Film===
[[Jack Kesy]] portrays Black Tom Cassidy in ''[[Deadpool 2]]''.<ref name="CutMutants">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/deadpool-2-mutants-black-tom-sluggo-mr-x/|title=Deadpool 2 Almost Had More Mutants Using A Lot More Mutant Powers|last=Faierman|first=Leo|website=Screen Rant|date=May 17, 2018|accessdate=May 19, 2018|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6zVcFmyae|archivedate=May 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> He is seen as an inmate at the Icebox, a prison for mutants. His powers are never shown as he wears a collar preventing him from using them. [[Deadpool]] and [[Rusty Collins|Russell (Firefist)]] encounter him and he and his goons beat them up. Later when the prisoners are being transported, Deadpool and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] show up and begin fighting. During the fight, Cable's gun goes off and he accidentally shoots Cassidy, killing him instantly. For most of the movie, there is a running gag about Cassidy's name as Deadpool mistakenly believes he is African-American due to the fact the word "black" is in his name and as a result believes Cable to be a racist.
