'''Hippo''' is the name of a fictional supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Hippo first appeared in ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: The Sinister Spider-Man'' #1 and was created by Brian Reed, [[Chris Bachalo]], and Tim Townsend.

==Fictional character biography==
Hippo is an ordinary zoo [[hippopotamus]] named "Mrs. Fluffy Lumpkins" (this was the name given to the hippopotamus despite the fact that it was a male) who was turned into a humanoid version of himself by the [[High Evolutionary]]. While on a crime spree upon being unable to find work in this form, he had his left leg eaten by [[Mac Gargan|Venom]] (who was masquerading as [[Spider-Man]] during the time when he was a member of the [[Dark Avengers]]).<ref name="Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man #2">''Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After that experience, he joined up with the Redeemers alongside Dementoid, Doctor Everything, Eleven, and General Wolfram in a plan to redeem "Spider-Man".<ref>''Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the meeting of the Redeemers' allies, Hippo mentions his background as those who had their limbs eaten off by Venom are outfitted with cybernetic parts.<ref name="Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man #2"/> When it came time for the Redeemers' gang to attack "Spider-Man", Hippo is rammed into General Wolfram when "Spider-Man" delivers a strong headbutt that did this.<ref>''Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hippo is later seen fighting [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] members Spider-Man and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]]. During this appearance, Hippo is shown to have his original left leg as if it was somehow restored. Both of them have a hard time taking down Hippo, who is ultimately defeated when [[Luke Cage]] falls on him.<ref>''New Avengers: Luke Cage'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Hippo is among the supervillains gathered by [[Doctor Octopus]] to secure specific items for him in exchange for a reward.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hippo next visits an underground casino in New York City that catered to the supervillain clientele where Hippo does badly at the tables. When [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] crash the casino, [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]] asked Hippo for help. Hippo declined since he had enough losses for the night.<ref>{{Cite comic

Hippo later appears as a member of the Menagerie which also consists of [[Skein (comics)|Skein]], [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], and a new villain called Panda-Mania. They were on a rampage stealing expensive eggs from an auction until Spider-Man arrives. Hippo throws cars at Spider-Man while claiming that the eggs would "secure his future." He and the Menagerie are defeated by Spider-Man despite the fact that Skein used her powers to destroy Spider-Man's outfit.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #1.

Later, Hippo appeared by himself attempting to rob a bank that was being guarded by [[Squirrel Girl]]. After a brief fight with Squirrel Girl, Chipmunk Hunk, and Koi Boi, he was convinced by Squirrel Girl to look into a job in [[demolition]] at which point he agrees and leaves without issue. Hippo did state that if this doesn't work out, he'll be returning to the bank to finish the job.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Ryan North|penciller = Erica Henderson|inker = Erica Henderson|colorist = Rico Renzi|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Wil Moss|title = The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl|volume = 1|issue = #6|date = 3 June 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

At the time when a Duplicate Squirrel Girl defeated most of Earth's superhumans and banished them to the [[Negative Zone]], she found that she overlooked Hippo. Squirrel Girl assembled Hippo, [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], and [[Rocket Raccoon]] to help her and her allies make a stand against the Duplicate Squirrel Girl. While the Duplicate Squirrel Girl found Hippo to be "easily-tossable," he and the others bought Squirrel Girl some time to rescue the other superhumans from the Negative Zone and defeat Duplicate Squirrel Girl.<ref>''Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Beats Up the Marvel Universe'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hippo appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "Bring on the Bad Guys" Pt. 1, voiced by [[Zack Shada]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Bring On the Bad Guys Pt. 1|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=33|airdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref> This version sports a cybernetic leg and his previous name of Mrs. Fluffy Lumpkins is often mentioned. He and Panda-Mania came to New York City from Toledo to attend the meeting and commit a heist which attracted the attention of Spider-Man. After collapsing part of the subway to distract Spider-Man, Hippo and Panda-Mania make their way to the meeting. When they hear from a mysterious person (later revealed to be Doctor Octopus' mind in [[Living Brain]]) that there is a bounty on Spider-Man, Hippo and Panda-Mania take their leave as Panda-Mania agrees to take Hippo to the local wax museum.
