'''MODOK''' (also written as '''M.O.D.O.K.'''; an [[acronym]] for '''M'''ental/'''M'''obile/'''M'''echanized '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''K'''illing) is the name of different [[character (arts)|fictional]] [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

The first MODOK is a former employee of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]], an arms dealing organization specializing in futuristic weaponry, who undergoes substantial [[mutagen]]ic medical experimentation originally designed to increase his intelligence. While successful, this experimentation results in a freakishly overdeveloped head, causing the character's signature look and use of a flying chair for mobility. After the experiments, he rebels against his masters and takes control of AIM. Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], MODOK has appeared in over four decades of Marvel continuity, and starred in the [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''[[Super-Villain Team-Up|Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11]]'' #1–5 ([[cover-date]]d September–December 2008) and a self-titled [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue ''MODOK: Reign Delay'' #1 (Nov. 2009).

MODOK has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[video game]]s and [[animation|animated]] [[television series]] and merchandise such as [[trading card]]s and toys. [[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked MODOK as #100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/100.html|title=Top 100 Villains: #100|publisher=IGN.com|accessdate=February 22, 2013}}</ref>

==Publication history==
MODOK first appeared in the title ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #93–94 (September–October 1967), and became a recurring foe for [[superhero]] [[Captain America]] where he was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] stated "Inevitably, he (MODOK) returned to plague Captain America, whose physical perfection he so resented."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

MODOK reappeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #120 (December 1969) and #133 (January 1971). The character also featured in a storyline in ''Sub-Mariner'' #49 (May 1972), before becoming the major villain in an extended storyline in ''[[Hulk (comic book)|Hulk]]'' #167–169 (September–November 1973). MODOK also participated in the "War of the Supervillains" storyline in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #74–75 (May–June 1975).

MODOK has a series of encounters with heroine [[Ms. Marvel]] in ''Ms. Marvel'' #5 (May 1977); #7 (July 1977) and #9-10 (September-October 1977). Constant battles against the Marvel heroes followed, including ''Iron Man Annual'' #4 (December 1977); ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #104 (April 1981) and ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #81–82 (November–December 1981). Following a failed bid to use fellow Hulk foe the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] to achieve his ends in ''Hulk'' #287–290 (September–December 1983), MODOK is assassinated in ''Captain America'' #313 (January  1986). The character's body makes a ghoulish return in ''Iron Man'' #205 (April 1986).

During the ''Taking A.I.M.'' storyline in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' #386–387 (May–June 1995); ''Captain America'' #440 (June 1995); ''Avengers'' #388 (July 1995) and ''Captain America'' #441 (July 1995), MODOK is resurrected. More typical attempts to better the character's situation followed in ''Iron Man/Captain America Annual 1998''; ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' vol. 2 #9–10 (November–December  2001); ''Wolverine'' #142–143 (September– October 1999); ''Captain America and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]'' #9 (January 2005) and ''Cable & Deadpool'' #11 (March 2005).

The character then made three humorous appearances, in ''Wha...Huh?'' #1 (September 2005); ''Marvel Holiday Special 2006'' (January 2007) and ''GLA-Xmas Special'' #1 (February 2006). After appearing briefly in the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] titles ''X-Men'' #200 (August 2007) and ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #488 (September 2007), MODOK was featured in ''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #14–17 (June–September 2007) and appeared in two miniseries: ''[[Marvel 1985]]'' #1–6 (July-December 2008) and ''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11'' #1–5 (August–December 2008).

MODOK also featured in ''Hulk'' #600 (September 2009); ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' vol. 2 #2 (May 2009) and the one-shot publication ''MODOK: Reign Delay'' #1 (November 2009).

MODOK later gained a counterpart in MODOK Superior where the character first appeared in ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #29 and was created by [[Jeff Parker (comics)|Jeff Parker]] and Gabriel Hardman.

==Fictional character biography==
===George Tarleton===
'''George Tarleton''' is a [[technician]] for the organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (A.I.M.). He was born in [[Bangor, Maine]]. Having recently created the [[Cosmic Cube]], the AIM scientists use advanced [[mutagen]]ics to alter Tarleton and create the super-intelligent '''MODOC''' (acronym for '''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''C'''omputing) to study and improve the object. MODOC, however, becomes ambitious, kills his former masters and takes control of A.I.M.. Calling himself '''MODOK''' ('''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''K'''illing), he comes into conflict with the hero [[Captain America]], who is intent on rescuing [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Sharon Carter]] from A.I.M..<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #93–94 (September–October 1967)</ref>

MODOK becomes a recurring foe for Captain America, battling the hero on three more occasions, with the last encounter revealing the villain's origin.<ref>''Captain America'' #112 (April 1969); #120 (December 1969); and #133 (January 1971)</ref> MODOK also battles [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and [[Doctor Doom]], the latter intent on claiming the Cosmic Cube.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #49 (May 1972)</ref>

MODOK reappears and kidnaps [[Betty Ross]], changing her into the mutate Harpy with gamma rays in a bid to destroy the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. The character follows the Hulk and the Harpy to a floating [[wikt:eyrie|aerie]], where the Hulk's [[alter ego]] Bruce Banner cures Ross of her condition. MODOK and an A.I.M. team arrive in time to kill the creature known as the [[Bi-Beast]], the guardian of the aerie, but not before activating a [[self-destruct]] mechanism, forcing the characters to flee.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #167–169 (September–November 1973)</ref> MODOK also accepts the offer of the other-dimensional being the [[Black Lama]] and participates in the "War of the Supervillains", but fails to capture the prize when defeated by [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #74–75 (May–June 1975)</ref>

A.I.M. becomes dissatisfied with the lack of scientific advancement under MODOK's leadership and MODOK's obsession with seeking revenge against [[Metahuman#Marvel Comics|metahuman]]s, ousting him from power. MODOK attempts to regain control of the organization and prove his worth by unleashing a [[nerve agent]] on [[New York City]], which is prevented by [[Ms. Marvel]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]].<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #5 (May 1977)</ref> MODOK seeks revenge against Ms. Marvel, first attempting to [[mind control]] the heroine<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #7 (July 1977)</ref> and then hiring the [[Shi'ar]] assassin [[Deathbird]] to kill her;<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #9 (September 1977)</ref> Ms. Marvel overcomes both of these obstacles and finally defeats MODOK.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #10 (October 1977)</ref>

MODOK's ambitions grow and he seeks world domination, but is thwarted by Iron Man and superhero team the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]].<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #4 (December 1977)</ref> After an attempt to plunder the resources of the [[Savage Land]] and a battle with [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] and the Hulk,<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #104 (April 1981)</ref> the character develops a new [[biological agent]] called Virus X. MODOK's attempts to test the agent on the [[homelessness|homeless]] is prevented by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], Sub-Mariner and Captain America, although the villain escapes and the Thing almost dies when exposed to the virus.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #81–82 (November–December 1981)</ref>

Abandoned by A.I.M. for these failures, the character revives long-time Hulk foe the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], planning to use the monster against his superiors. The plan fails when the Abomination is revealed to be mentally unstable, although during the course of the storyline MODOK transforms [[Kate Waynesboro|Dr. Katherine Waynesboro]] (an associate of Bruce Banner) into Ms. MODOK, a female version of himself. Horrified by MODOK's callous disregard for life, Waynesboro demands to be restored to human form, and MODOK complies.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #287–290 (September–December 1983)</ref> Wishing to disassociate themselves from MODOK, A.I.M. hires the [[Serpent Society]] to assassinate the villain. They succeed, with [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]] striking the killing blow.<ref>''Captain America'' #313 (January 1986)</ref> The Serpent Society return MODOK's body to A.I.M., with the organization using it as a [[supercomputer]]. A rogue A.I.M. agent remotely operates MODOK's body in a bid to destroy Iron Man, with the battle ending with the body's destruction.<ref>''Iron Man'' #205 (April 1986)</ref>

Although MODOK had died, A.I.M. temporarily replaced him with his more loyal, and in some ways more effective, second female counterpart [[MODAM]].<ref>''Quasar'' #9</ref>

During the ''Taking A.I.M.'' storyline, MODOK is resurrected because A.I.M. needs MODOK to assist with the creation of another Cosmic Cube. Eventually MODOK is stranded in an alternate dimension, but manages to return with the unintended help of the villainous group the [[Headmen]].<ref>''Avengers'' #386–387 (May–June 1995); ''Captain America'' #440 (June 1995); ''Avengers'' #388 (July 1995); ''Captain America'' #441 (July 1995)</ref> After attempting to steal a device that boosts mental power,<ref>''Iron Man/Captain America Annual 1998''</ref> MODOK agrees to aid the Headmen in their plans of conquest, but after taking control of A.I.M. once again, he reneges on the agreement to avoid an encounter with the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #9–10 (November–December 2001)</ref> MODOK clashes with [[Canada|Canadian]] superhero team [[Alpha Flight]]<ref>''Wolverine'' #142–143 (September–October 1999)</ref> before being captured by a group composed of [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|U.S. Naval intelligence]] and a [[drug cartel]]. MODOK is [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]] and employed to infiltrate [[spy satellite]]s and manipulate the [[stock market]], but he recovers and exploits the situation until captured and taken into custody by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].<ref>''Captain America & The Falcon'' #9 (January 2005)</ref>

During the ''GLX-Mas Special'', MODOK and A.I.M. fought [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and his [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] squad but were defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]] and her sidekick Tippy-Toe.<ref>''GLX-Mas Special'' #1</ref>

MODOK then seeks a sample of the [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] species the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]],<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #11 (March 2005)</ref> and after brief encounters with the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[X-Men]],<ref>''X-Men'' #200 (August 2007) & ''Uncanny X-Men'' #488 (September  2007)</ref> battles Ms. Marvel once again, the heroine aided by fellow [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Wonder Man]] during an elaborate scheme by renegade A.I.M. branches to kill MODOK, with one of the rogues being MODOK's long-lost son, who seeks revenge for his abandonment.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' (vol. 2) #14–17 (June–September 2007)</ref> Employing an elaborate scheme and [[wikt:double-cross|double-cross]], MODOK restores his personal wealth and power and establishes himself as the leader of A.I.M. once again.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11'' #1–5 (September–December 2008)</ref>

It is also revealed that MODOK was involved in the creation of both the [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] and the [[Red She-Hulk]] and belongs to the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]], a secret organization of genius-level supervillains.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #600 (September 2009)</ref>

MODOK was seen in [[Puerto Rico]] attempting to create an army of genetically enhanced monkeys called A.I.Monkeys to eliminate the recession in A.I.M., until he was defeated by [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Invisible Woman]] and the rookie Puerto Rican hero known as El Vejigante.<ref>''Fantastic Four in Ataque del M.O.D.O.K.'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Fall of the Hulks]]'' storyline, it is revealed that MODOK is a member of the Intelligencia, who had a part in the creation of both Red Hulk and Red She-Hulk.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Alpha''</ref> They captured some of the smartest men and brought about the events that would lead up to the ''[[World War Hulks]]'' storyline.

When several heroes are subjected, by the Intelligencia, to the Cathexis ray which can transfer radiant energy from one subject to another, [[Amadeus Cho]] is affected as well. Unlike the others, who become "Hulked-Out Heroes", his mind expands and becomes so powerful he gains the ability to warp reality within a 10-foot radius. Using this power, he reverses the process that created MODOK, turning him back into George Tarleton, who knows no better than to get away as quickly as possible.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #610</ref>

George Tarleton was taken into custody by the U.S. military and remains confined, where Bruce Banner occasionally calls on him to help defuse the "doomsday plans" MODOK installed in the case his master plan should fail. Tarleton, however, appears to remember next to nothing of his time as MODOK and, in fact, seems to be either traumatized or just a simple-minded man.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #28</ref>

===MODOK Superior===
Unknown to everyone, the doomsday plans left behind by MODOK serve as a distraction. The plans themselves are coordinated by a 'cluster' of brains, cloned from MODOK's own, who act as one non-sentient [[supercomputer]]. This cluster is destroyed by the Red Hulk and the doomsday plans are stopped. However, one of the cloned brains, rather than being utilized as an organic computer, is allowed to develop naturally and then uploaded with MODOK's memories. This new MODOK (apparently free from the weaknesses of the original) declares himself '''MODOK Superior''' and prepares to make his own mark on the world.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #29</ref>

Cooperating with the Intelligencia once again, MODOK Superior and the Intelligencia attempt to study the body of a Spaceknight, which had crashed on Earth for unknown reasons. When the Avengers attempt to stop them, the body is revealed to be the latest vessel for the consciousness of Ultron. In the battle with the Avengers, MODOK Superior takes on Thor, claiming he has the power of a god - and being immediately struck down.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 4) #12.1</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, MODOK Superior reviews the attacks by Skadi and tells his followers that she is actually [[Red Skull]]'s daughter [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] who has tapped into the powers of the [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardians]]. He then views from his surveillance that Red Hulk is fighting Thing (in the form of Angrir: Breaker of Souls). When he learns that Zero/One and Black Fog are also after Red Hulk, MODOK Superior plans to get to Red Hulk first.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #37</ref> MODOK Superior prevents Black Fog from killing Red Hulk. MODOK Superior becomes intangible to keep himself from getting attacked by Angrir (who shoots down Zero/One's Helicarrier). MODOK Superior has his encounter with Zero/One and both of them declare a truce to help fight the soldiers of the Serpent. During that time, MODOK Superior starts to develop a crush on Zero/One.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #38</ref>

In the prologue to the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, MODOK Superior targets an ex-A.I.M. scientist named Dr. Udaku who was being escorted to the Pentagon by Wakandan forces. Before MODOK Superior could burn Dr. Udaku, [[Scarlet Witch]] arrives and fights MODOK Superior while smaller MODOK pawns surround Scarlet Witch. In the nick of time, [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]] and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] arrive and help to defeat MODOK Superior and A.I.M..<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0</ref>

MODOK Superior and some rogue A.I.M. Agents joined up with S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to make a deal to take down [[Andrew Forson]] (the current leader of A.I.M.).<ref>''Secret Avengers'' (vol. 2) #12</ref>

After a brief retirement, MODOK Superior returned and opened up a group of assassins called the Agents of MODOK ('''M'''ercenary '''O'''rganization '''D'''edicated '''O'''nly to '''K'''illing) where they killed bad people. However, he made the mistake of recruiting [[Gwenpool]] when she killed his top assassin and took credit for his kills.<ref>''Unbelievable Gwenpool'' #2</ref> When he found she was not a superhuman and had no special training, he attempted to eliminate her, but she turned on him and sent him into space with an injured eye and damaged equipment.<ref>''Unbelievable Gwenpool'' #4</ref> She then took over his agency for a brief time, but when her plans defeated a group of alien arms dealers, but did not get them any money (having turned the client, an old [[Doombot]] who escaped from a fight in the past with Squirrel Girl, against them) the agency was disbanded and everyone went their own way.<ref>''Unbelievable Gwenpool'' #10</ref>

MODOK Superior and a group of A.I.M. members attacked a HYDRA airship to capture Shiklah, who was in its custody. [[Deadpool]] saved her, and stole MODOK Superior's chair.<ref>''Deadpool: The Gauntlet Infinite Comic'' #7</ref> MODOK Superior was taken to the hospital where he vowed vengeance on Deadpool for stealing his chair.<ref>''Deadpool: The Gauntlet Infinite Comic'' #8</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, MODOK Superior appears as a member of the Army of Evil and took part in the attack on Manhattan in retaliation for what happened at Pleasant Hill during "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]".<ref>''Secret Empire'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
George Tarleton was subjected to a mutagenic process that transformed him into MODOK and grants him [[superhuman]] intelligence, including a computer-like memory, the ability to scour and retain large data-banks of information very quickly, and solve abstract mathematical problems nearly instantaneously. He also has the ability to calculate the mathematical probability of any given event occurring, which is so strong that it borders on [[precognition]]. However, his creativity remains at an average human level. MODOK's vast intelligence makes him one of the few beings that can analyze and comprehend the workings of the [[Cosmic Cube]], which was the very purpose for his creation.

As MODOK, he also has [[psionics|psionic]] powers enabling him to contact others through telepathy, cast illusions, mentally control individuals and large groups, generate [[force shield|force fields]] able to withstand minor nuclear explosions, and focus his mental power into devastating beams through a headband. A side effect of the mutation was the growth of Tarleton's head to the point whereby his body can no longer support its weight, needing to rely on an [[exoskeleton]] and a [[hovercar|hoverchair]] called the Doomsday Chair for movement. The Doomsday Chair is equipped with a variety of weapons, including missiles and [[laser]]s. 

Occasionally, Tarleton had the use of a giant humanoid robot body that was proportionally sized to fit his head.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #167–169 (September–November 1973) and ''Iron Man'' #74–75 (May–June 1975)</ref> Tarleton's organs also wear out quickly, necessitating the use of harvested clones, whose organs are used to sustain him.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk'' #1 (March 2010)</ref> As the leader of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], MODOK has advanced technology, resources, and a personal army at his disposal.

MODOK Superior has the same intelligence and mental powers as the original MODOK, but apparently none of his weaknesses.

==Other versions==
===''Marvel Adventures''===
A version called "MODOC" ('''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''C'''onquest) appears in the title ''[[Marvel Adventures: The Avengers]]'', briefly turning the Avengers into (superior) versions of itself before being defeated.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: The Avengers'' #9 (March  2007)</ref>

===''Ms. Marvel''===
Over the course of her two series, [[Carol Danvers]] ([[Ms. Marvel#Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]) had several interactions with A.I.M. and MODOK; among others, she was both saved from being disincorporated by 24 embryonic MODOCs who had been outfitted with reality-altering powers when working in unison and separated into two separate entities to fulfill her fondest wish.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' (vol. 2) #45</ref> Also, reference was made, by A.I.M. personnel, to many actual MODOCs who, apparently, really did function in the way that MODOK was originally supposed to have done (namely, as docile organic supercomputers).<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' (vol. 2) #39</ref>

===MODOT===
'''MODOT''' ('''M'''obile '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''T'''alking), formerly [[Nobel Prize]] hopeful '''Dimitri Smirkov''', appears in the third ''[[Howard the Duck]]'' miniseries and, unlike his predecessor MODOK, can walk without the aid of a hoverchair. He had no designs of world conquest, but instead was only interested in making money; this may be because the branch of A.I.M. that created him did so specifically so he could ''talk'' the head office into increasing their budget. He ended up practically ruling the airwaves, influencing millions of viewers through 100 android hosts, anchormen and reporters, all controlled directly by him.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' (vol. 3) #1–4 (Nov. 2007–Feb. 2008)</ref>

===MODOG===
Iron Man has an encounter with '''MODOG''' ('''M'''obile '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''G'''enocide) in the second volume of ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]''. Iron Man dispatches him with ease, dumping him in outer space.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' (vol. 2) #2 (Aug.  2008)</ref>

===Marvel MAX===
The limited series ''U.S. War Machine'', published under the mature-audience [[Marvel MAX]] imprint, showcases another version of MODOK salvaged by S.H.I.E.L.D. when it is discarded by A.I.M., apparently a victim of [[racial prejudice]].<ref>''U.S. War Machine'' #1–12 (Nov. 2001–Jan. 2002)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the character features in the title ''[[Ultimate Vision]]'', experimenting with a [[Galactus#Ultimate Marvel|Gah Lak Tus]] probe on an A.I.M. space station. Although he starts the story as the amoral genius cyborg George Tarleton, after he is infected by Gah Lak Tus, he is eventually reduced to a disembodied head.<ref>''Ultimate Vision'' #1-5</ref>

Another version of MODOK appeared in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars|Ultimate Armor Wars]]'' #2, when the devious [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]] revealed that he, too, was a cyborg and harbored a tiny MODOK inside his hollow head.<ref>''Ultimate Armor Wars'' #2</ref>

===Nextwave===
At least four versions of MODOK, apparently based around [[Elvis Presley]], were created by the [[Beyond Corporation]] to defend their secret weapons factory, State 51. They were defeated by the [[Nextwave]] Squad. Their principal mode of attack seemed to involve shooting cheeseburgers at their target.<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #11</ref>

The following issue revealed that the Beyond Corporation was being run by a disguised infant MODOK, apparently conceived by a MODOK and a MODAM. This MODOK escapes the Nextwave Squad, but it is subsequently killed by its master, [[Devil Dinosaur]].<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #12 (March 2007)</ref>

===Amalgam Comics===
A version of the character features in ''Iron Lantern'' #1, a one-shot title that is a part of the [[Amalgam Comics]] line, which is a [[sequel]] to the ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' miniseries. MODOK is merged with [[DC Comics]] character [[Hector Hammond]] to form '''H.E.C.T.O.R.''' ('''H'''ighly '''E'''volved '''C'''reature '''T'''otally '''O'''riented  for '''R'''evenge), who is the leader of the Weaponers of A.I.M. (a merging of DC's the [[Qward#Fictional history|Weaponers of Qward]] and Marvel's A.I.M.).<ref>''Iron Lantern'' #1 (June 1997)</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
An alternate version of MODOK is seen being eaten by zombified versions of [[She-Hulk]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. Later, it is discovered that this universe's [[Ash Williams]] had watched this MODOK be devoured.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness'' #3</ref>

===Earth X===
An alternate version of MODOK appeared in ''[[Earth X]]''. In recent history, MODOK, like every other telepath on the planet, was killed when the [[Red Skull]]'s powers first manifested. MODOK's hoverchair, ironically, was later recovered by the Skull's army and the Skull used it as his personal throne.<ref>''Earth X'' #2</ref>

===MODORD===
A [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]-centered story, "Disco Highway", in issue #4 of the miniseries ''[[X-Men]]: Serve and Protect'', released in February 2011, features a character named '''MODORD''' ('''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''R'''oller '''D'''erby).<ref>''X-Men: Serve and Protect'' #4</ref>

===MODOK: Assassin===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, the [[Battleworld]] domain of Killville is based on a reality where MODOK killed every known superhero, which resulted in its citizens being in constant danger from every supervillain and killer in Killville.<ref>''MODOK: Assassin'' #1</ref>

===Spider-Gwen===
In the pages of ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' that is taking place on Earth-65, Captain America fights against '''MODAAK''' ('''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''A'''s '''A'''merica's '''K'''ing).<ref>''Spider-Gwen Annual'' #1</ref> The author based this character on American then-presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Suebsaeng|first1=Asawin|title=Marvel Artist Who Made a Trump Supervillain Thinks Donald Is a ‘Goddamn Idiot’|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/06/marvel-artist-who-made-a-trump-supervillain-thinks-donald-is-a-goddamn-idiot.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref>
