'''Master Mold''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Since his primary purpose was to act as a portable [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]]-creating factory, and the Sentinel robots were primarily used to hunt [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], Master Mold has almost exclusively appeared in the [[X-Men]] and related, mutant-themed, comic books.

==Fictional character biography==
Master Mold was created by Dr. [[Bolivar Trask]] during the original run of X-Men comics. In the 1960s, out of fear of a race of superhuman mutants that could dominate the whole world and enslave normal human beings, Trask makes Master Mold, a super-computer, in the shape of a giant [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robot, that will control and facilitate the construction of the Sentinels, mechanical warriors programmed to hunt and capture superhuman mutants. Unbeknownst to all, the original Master Mold is also programmed by the time-traveling Tanya Trask ([[Madame Sanctity]]), part of the Askani Sisterhood, with the mission to find and destroy [[Apocalypse: The Twelve|The Twelve]]: a group of mutants that are linked to the rise of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], which the ruthless Sanctity considered an event that must be stopped at all costs.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Minus 1'' (1997)</ref> For unknown reasons, some of the mutants that are cataloged as the Twelve are not part of the group. The Master Mold has Trask captured, and it decides to take over humanity to keep it safe.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

The original Master Mold is eventually destroyed when Trask sacrifices himself by causing an explosion to prevent the Sentinels taking over humanity, but several other Master Molds are later built by other people who want to manufacture Sentinels. In the late 1980s, the remains of Master Mold merges with [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]], an advanced Sentinel from the future, thanks to the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] to form the being called [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], which acts like an almost-human Master Mold during the late 1990s and early 2000s.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Another Master Mold appeared in ''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #7. It claimed to be [[Steven Lang (comics)|Steven Lang]] who was thought to be dead after Project Armageddon. It said that he (as Lang) did not die immediately from the crash of his flying gunship; he managed to pull himself out of the wreckage and crawl to his greatest weapon, Master Mold, which merged with Lang when he tried to activate it. It was nearly destroyed by the [[Hulk]] who was with [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] in Master Mold's meteor space base. It was completely destroyed when the base exploded, after Hulk, Angel, and Iceman managed to escape.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Master Mold also claimed the name and identity of Stephen Lang during a story arc ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #17–24, later reprinted in the graphic novel ''Cyclops: Retribution'': Master Mold creates the Retribution Virus, designed to wipe out mutantkind. It blames [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] entirely for its death as Stephen Lang. He hypnotizes [[Moira MacTaggart]] and uses her to unleash the virus, infecting Cyclops, [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], and [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], who is completely incapacitated. However, MacTaggart breaks free of his grasp. While she attempts to cure the virus, Cyclops and Callisto team with Conscience (another artificial construct developed from Lang's brain engrams) to stop Master Mold and save mutantkind as well as all  humanity, which had become threatened by the virus. Cyclops, though weakened from the effects of the disease, nearly single-handedly destroys the Master Mold before finally succumbing to his illness and falling unconscious. As Master Mold prepares to kill Cyclops and finish unleashing the virus, he is suddenly attacked by a cured Banshee who uses his sonic scream to "finish the job that Cyclops started" and destroys Master Mold. The virus is then cured before it has a chance to spread.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Another Master Mold is built in secret in the jungles of [[Ecuador]]. This particular Master Mold builds a new breed of Sentinels, known as Wild Sentinels, which are capable of assimilating non-organic materials to assume different shapes, most of them insectoid, as well as a breed of Nano-Sentinels. This Master Mold is taken over by [[Cassandra Nova]] who uses the Wild Sentinels to destroy [[Genosha]] and in her subsequent plan to destroy the X-Men. Following their defeat at the hands of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s X-Men team, the [[Children of the Vault]] escaped and regrouped in the Ecuadorian Master Mold.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

In ''[[X-Men: Second Coming]]'', [[X-Force]] travels to the [[Days of Future Past]] timeline where there are two Master Molds, one of them producing Nimrods and another one protecting the first Master Mold.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

After the latest [[Tri-Sentinel]] was destroyed by an Isotope Genome Accelerator duplicate of [[Spider-Man]], a saddened [[Mendel Stromm]] was approached by a mysterious benefactor who began to give him a Master Mold that specializes in creating Tri-Sentinels.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the two Spider-Men reunite into one body, Spider-Man was able to take remote control of the Tri-Sentinels and send them back to the Master Mold base to destroy it.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In House of X, the Orchis Project, a grouping of Earth scientists centered on human survival in the face of an ascendant Mutant population creates the Mother Mold, a Master Mold variant designed to create Master Molds. <ref>''[[House of X]]'' #1</ref> It is later revealed that the Mother Mold will be the Sentinel generation that lead directly to the creation of Nimrod.<ref>''[[Powers of X]]'' #2</ref>

==Capabilities==
Dr. Bolivar Trask equipped Master Mold with powerful weaponry and the ability to speak; Master Mold was also mobile so that it could defend itself from mutant attackers or so that it can be relocated easily if Trask had to find a new headquarters. The Steven Lang Master Molds were also capable of self-repair.

==Other versions==
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe equivalent of Master Mold are two individuals: 
* The first equivalent has a possible future where [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is used as an original template to create an army of Sentinels which share his personality traits. However, present day [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and Wolverine discover the mutilated body and he asks them to kill him in order to cease the production.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four/X-Men'' Annual #1</ref> 
* The second equivalent is [[Jason Stryker|William Stryker]]'s mutant power to [[Technopathy|infuse some of his brain patterns]] on the [[Nimrod (comics)|new Sentinels]] to built a giant Sentinel called Master Mold which houses his mind.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #11</ref>

In the alternate reality of ''[[Weapon X]]: Days of Future Now'', one of [[Madison Jeffries]]' Boxbots dubbed ''Bot'' becomes the new Master Mold and traps Jeffries within its body in order to use his powers to build new Sentinels without exhausting Jeffries.<ref>''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' #1</ref>

In ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] Forever Master Mold'', Master Mold is bonded to [[Cameron Hodge]] by Apocalypse to form '''Master Meld'''.<ref>''X-Factor Forever Master Mold''</ref>

In ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]] Age of Ultron'' series set in an alternative future, Wolverine, the Hulk, Peter Parker and a Ghost Rider travel to the [[Savage Land]] in order to confront an older [[Ezekiel Stane]] using a surviving Master Mold to reproduce Stark Iron Man armors. Stane uses an unnamed girl, described as an orphan, the sole remaining Trask descendant, and referred to only as 'Ms. Trask', in order to operate the Master Mold that had apparently been left behind in the Savage Land. Seeking to unleash a wave of the armors upon the world, Stane is stopped and this Master Mold ultimately destroyed.<ref>''What If? Age of Ultron'' #2</ref>

===Television===

====''X-Men: The Animated Series''====
[[Image:Mastermold2.jpg|Master Mold in the ''X-Men Animated Series''|right|thumb]]
Master Mold served an important role during the mid-1990s [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]], voiced by [[David Fox (actor)|David Fox]] (Season 1) and [[Nigel Bennett]] (Seasons 3-4). During season one, the X-Men [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] are kidnapped by [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], sent by [[Bolivar Trask]] and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], while vacationing on the fictional [[Genosha]] island. There, the three X-Men and several other mutants are enslaved by Trask and Gyrich that are harnessing the mutants' powers to create a massive [[dam]] in Genosha whose [[water power]] will be used to run the newly developed Master Mold program. The [[X-Men]] eventually escape Genosha and destroy most of the Sentinels by Storm's flooding the dam. In the season finale, the X-Men later learn that Trask has lost control of Master Mold, now stationed in [[Washington, D.C.]] Master Mold has [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] (and dozens of other important world leaders) kidnapped and demands that Trask replace their brains with computers that can be controlled by Master Mold. He had plans to kidnap world leaders from around the world and replace their brains with computers so that the world would fall under his control. Master Mold had concluded that mutants were humans, therefore humans must be protected from themselves. He planned to bring order and peace to the world in accordance with his programming to protect humans from mutants. As Trask tries to stop his own creation and the X-Men rescue Kelly, [[Professor X]] seemingly destroyed Master Mold's body by flying an explosive-filled [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] into the robot's chest, escaping at the last minute with [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto's]] help. However, season four revealed that Master Mold's head and intelligence had survived. Master Mold was commissioning Sentinels to steal top-secret, indestructible lightweight plastics in order to create a new body for himself. He also had Sentinels kidnap Trask and Gyrich (as he felt the two had betrayed him) as well as Professor X as he plans on grafting Xavier into his new body to acquire the Professor's brain and powers. The X-Men eventually freed Master Mold's captives and [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] seemingly destroyed Master Mold's head once and for all. But in [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop's]] timeline, Master Mold rules the United States, hunting down mutants that are put in concentration camps and using [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] as a personal enforcer.

====''Wolverine and the X-Men''====
Master Mold appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Gwendoline Yeo]]. Unlike the conventional version, this iteration sports a [[Danger (comics)|feminine characterization]]. Her first reference is during the episode "Thieves Gambit", where the name appears on a screen in the MRD lab. In the episode "Future X", Master Mold's MRD-dominated [[Days of Future Past|future]] has gained complete control over the world. She has her Sentinels detain mutants and take the captives to replicate their powers so that the Sentinels can evolve. Humans such as [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|Colonel Moss]] were made into cyborgs and placed as the detention facilities' wardens. When Professor X gets sighted, Master Mold ordered Professor X to be captured alive, in order that she may use her replicated version of [[Cerebro]] to locate all of Earth's mutants. During the episode "Backlash", she was created by Bolivar Trask in the present to create and control the Sentinels as a processing terminal. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] destroyed Master Mold's body, but she transferred her programming into a damaged Sentinel, which initially repaired its programming and managed to escape; It's implied that this Sentinel will be the ruler of the future. In the series finale, Master Mold physically appears when the future X-Men team launched a full-scale attack, however, the X-Men were overpowered by her immense power. Although this battle's results are not shown, the efforts of the X-Men's present team prevented Master Mold's post-apocalyptic future from happening.

===Video games===
* Master Mold appeared in ''[[Spider-Man and the X-Men in Arcade's Revenge]]'' as the final boss for [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]'s stage. But his name was mistakenly put as '''Master Blast''' on the back of the box of the cartridges and the advertisements.
* Master Mold appeared in ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]'' in the background of the Sentinel processing plant combat area. He lifts off if the Sentinel wins and is destroyed if the Sentinel loses.
