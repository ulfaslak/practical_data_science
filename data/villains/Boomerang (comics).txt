==Fictional character biography==
Fred Myers was born in [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory]], [[Australia]] and was raised in the United States. As a young boy he developed a love for [[baseball]], and spent years training and perfecting his pitching arm. By the time he was a young adult, Fred had realized his dream of [[Pitcher|pitching]] for a major league team. However, he foolishly began accepting bribes, and was drummed out of the major leagues after being discovered. Shortly thereafter, Myers was contacted by the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]], an international criminal organization that saw the potential of his skills. Myers agreed and was given a new costume and an arsenal of deadly [[boomerang]]s, from which he derived his new code name. He battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] after taking [[Betty Ross]] hostage to get plans, but the Hulk rescues Betty.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #81</ref>

After the Secret Empire collapsed, Boomerang returned to his native Australia and laid low for a few years, perfecting his deadly aim and making modifications to his weapons. Once he was ready, he returned to America and began offering his services as a freelance assassin-for-hire. His first mission was to assassinate [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], though he was defeated.<ref>''Iron Fist'' #13</ref> He was next hired as part of a large group of superhuman criminals employed by [[Libra (Marvel Comics)|Libra]] to battle the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #64</ref> He was hired by [[Madame Hydra|Viper]] to participate in a plot against [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and battled [[Spider-Man]], [[Nick Fury]], [[Shang-Chi]], and the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #83-85</ref> Boomerang next sought to kill Spider-Man in order to impress the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] of Crime and thus gain employment; however, he was defeated by the wall-crawler and apprehended by the police.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #67</ref> He was seen next helping the [[Punisher]] escape from prison.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #81</ref> Boomerang was eventually released from prison. He was hired by Max Stryker to coerce Bruce Banner into using an experimental cancer cure that uses gamma rays on Stryker, but wound up battling the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Banner's alter ego, instead.<ref>''Hulk'' #294-295</ref>

Boomerang was then recruited by [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] into the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. As part of that team, he battled Spider-Man, [[Silver Sable]], and the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #280-281</ref> Then, he was hired by Louis Baxter III to attack a yacht, and again battled Spider-Man.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #144-145</ref> He then battled [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] at the instigation of a disguised [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #27</ref> Next, he teamed with [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]] and [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]] II to help [[Iron Man]] battle the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #239</ref> He was then employed by [[Justin Hammer]], and battled [[Cardiac (comics)|Cardiac]] and Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #345</ref> With the Sinister Syndicate again, he participated in a crime spree. During these events, Boomerang vied with [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] for [[Leila Davis]]'s affections.<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1</ref> Boomerang was among several of the hired killers who responded to an open bounty on [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] that was put out by [[Samuel Silke]] as part of an elaborate plan to usurp the Kingpin's empire.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel NOW!===
During the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Boomerang is operating as a crime boss of Newark. After Captain America was turned into a HYDRA agent by [[Red Skull]]'s clone using the powers of [[Kobik]] and take over the world after killing [[Red Skull]]'s clone, Boomerang offers a shelter for [[Maria Hill]], [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], and her [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] to devise a plan to rebel against HYDRA's regime. Later on, his safehouse is attacked by [[Punisher]] who is now apparently in the employ of HYDRA.<ref>''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' #3</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Fred Myers has no superhuman powers, but he has the strength, speed, agility, dexterity, reflexes, coordination, and endurance of a professional athlete from his days as a baseball player. He can throw small objects with nearly unerring accuracy, and his aim is nearly the peak of what a non-superpowered human can accomplish. Only characters like [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] can match his accuracy.

Boomerang's most dangerous asset is, naturally, his arsenal of specialized boomerangs designed by [[Justin Hammer]]. He has modified and improved on them over the years, but the most common ones are exploding "shatterangs" (with enough explosive power to destroy an automobile), "gasarangs" that release large doses of tear gas to disable a target, razor-bladed "razorangs", sonic blasting "screamerangs", and whirling "bladarangs" which cut like buzzsaw blades.

Boomerang wears light body armor supplied by Hammer, with a wide variety of hidden pockets and pouches for his smaller, specialized boomerangs, in addition to attachments for securing the seven larger primary boomerangs. Boomerang also has jet boosters in his boots which are controlled by mental command through cybernetic circuitry in the cowl, that allow him to fly through the air at speeds up to {{convert|30|mi/h|km/h}}, and can be used as an offensive weapon when fired at close range.

Boomerang has knowledge of basic street-fighting techniques.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate version of Boomerang appeared briefly in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #61</ref> Spider-Man saved him from being shot by the [[Punisher]] during a heist. Boomerang thanks and then offers Spider-Man thousands of dollars to save him from the police, but Spider-Man webs him up along with his would-be assassin/thief. Like the [[Shocker (comics)#Ultimate Shocker|Shocker]], his Ultimate self is a much weaker, almost parody version of himself.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #61</ref>

===JLA/Avengers===
{{main|JLA/Avengers}}
Boomerang is among the enthralled villains defending [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold, and is defeated by [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]'s Flash.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>

===Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows===
During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline in the pages of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows]]'', Boomerang works as an enforcer of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Regent|Regent]] where he, Rhino, and Shocker beat up [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]] for protesting against Regent's rules.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Regent later recruits Boomerang, Beetle, and Rhino to fill in the membership gaps in the Sinister Six following the deaths of Doctor Octopus and Hobgoblin and Vulture being incapacitated. He and the Sinister Six attack S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secret base after Regent probed Sandman's mind.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>
