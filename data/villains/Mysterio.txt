'''Mysterio''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly as enemies of [[Spider-Man]]. The first and most high-profile incarnation of Mysterio is '''Quentin Beck''', although several other characters have since used the Mysterio alias.

The character has appeared in numerous Spider-Man cartoons and video games. In 2009, Mysterio was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 85th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/85.html Mysterio is number 85] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103130918/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/85.html |date=November 3, 2013 }} [[IGN]].

==Fictional character biography==
Debuting in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #13, Mysterio is Quentin Beck, a [[special effect]]s wizard and stunt man working for a major Hollywood studio with dreams of making a name for himself in the film industry. However, he came to see his career in special effects as a dead-end job. His attempts to become an actor were poorly received, but he realized that his expertise in illusions could make him an effective criminal.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In his first battle with Spider-Man, after he frames Spider-Man for robbing the Midtown Museum, Mysterio obstructs the hero's spider-sense with gas and dissolves Spider-Man's webbing with a chemical abrasive. However Spider-Man tricks Mysterio into revealing he robbed the museum, then Spider-Man revealed he had captured it on tape. Mysterio was then jailed, blaming Spider-Man for his ruined career.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #13</ref> Mysterio later joins the [[Sinister Six]] in an attempt at revenge on Spider-Man, and battles him using robots of the [[X-Men]]. After this Spider-Man gets a card that enables him to go on to battle [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref>

Mysterio later creates the alias of world-renowned psychiatrist '''Dr. Ludwig Rinehart''', using technology and [[hypnosis]] in an attempt to make Spider-Man lose his mind, and nearly convincing him to unmask, though ironically Spider-Man was helped by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] suddenly bursting into the house. Spider-Man then unmasked Mysterio.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #24</ref> Mysterio then establishes a brief partnership with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] in a plot to kill Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]] on a Hollywood movie set by pretending to enroll them in a film. However they were both defeated and arrested.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #4</ref> He threatens to destroy the city while on TV, and goes on to convince Spider-Man he is {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=}} tall using a post-hypnotic suggestion and a miniature funfair, but Spider-Man sees through the illusion and captures Mysterio yet again.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #66–67</ref>

While Beck is incarcerated, his cellmate Daniel Berkhart briefly becomes Mysterio on the original's behalf.<ref name="AMS141">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #141–142</ref> Out of prison, Beck resumes his Ludwig Rinehart identity to manipulate Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]] into revealing the whereabouts of a lost fortune hidden in her house.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #198–199</ref> Beck used bogus alien disguises to frighten May Parker into revealing the location of the fortune, but then learned that the money had long ago been eaten by [[silverfish]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #50–51</ref> In his next appearance, Mysterio tricks Spider-Man into believing that he had caused the death of a bystander.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #311</ref> Mysterio then attempts to scare the tenants from an apartment complex in a real estate scam thwarted by the preteen superhero team, [[Power Pack]],<ref>''Power Pack'' #55</ref> much to his later humiliation. He is recruited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to form the second Sinister Six, and battles Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335–339</ref>

In other encounters, Mysterio has faked the death of Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]],<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #200</ref> and made deals with demons from [[Otherplace|Limbo]].<ref>''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #5</ref> Despite this, however, Mysterio was constantly beaten by Spider-Man and usually arrested. He joined Doctor Octopus' Sinister Six on several occasions, but this never gave him the edge against his foe that he desired. Eventually, he began to lose credibility as a supervillain, with his defeat at the hands of Power Pack being a particularly humiliating moment.{{issue|date=March 2012}}

After his final imprisonment during the ''[[Guardian Devil]]'' storyline, Mysterio was given an early release, as he had been diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]] and [[lung cancer]], both caused by the chemicals and radiation from his equipment. He was given one year to live, but this imminent death caused prison psychiatrists to grant him an early release.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #7</ref> Obsessed with exacting his final revenge on Spider-Man, he was disappointed when he deduced from newspaper articles that the current Spider-Man was just a [[Ben Reilly|clone]] and saw no dignity in overpowering a 'copy' of the real thing (even though by then, the clone had been killed and the current Spider-Man was indeed the original).<ref name="Dv2#1-7">''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #1–7</ref> Mysterio decided to change his plan and focus on [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], whom he had encountered recently during an insurance scam that the hero had thwarted; Mysterio believed that he had found a 'kindred spirit' in Daredevil, in the sense that both were [[wikt:second-stringer|second stringers]] with little reputation outside their homes.<ref name="Dv2#1-7"/>

After the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] gave Mysterio all the information he possessed about Daredevil's past, Mysterio developed an elaborate plot to drive Daredevil insane using a special designed drug to influence Daredevil's mood, presenting him with a baby girl and conflicting reports that she was the second coming of Christ or the [[Antichrist]], with the drug rendering Daredevil violent if anyone suggested that the child was innocent.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #1</ref> In the course of the scheme, [[Karen Page]] was killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] after Mysterio had convinced her that she was suffering from [[HIV]] due to her time as a [[pornographic actor|porn star]],<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #5</ref> Matt Murdock's partner [[Foggy Nelson]] was framed for murder after cheating on his current lover,<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #3</ref> and Daredevil nearly lost his mind as he appeared to be tormented by the forces of Hell{{clarify|date=January 2019}}.<ref name="Dv2#1-7"/>

However, Daredevil's will proved stronger than Mysterio expected, and once [[Doctor Strange]] discovers and magically removed the drug from Daredevil's bloodstream, Daredevil unmasked Mysterio as the mastermind, shattering the villain's helmet in fury and revealing his now languishing appearance. Beck had thought Daredevil would kill him upon discovery, which in his eyes, was a "grand way to end his final show". Daredevil denied him this and instead dismissed Mysterio's scheme as a basic 'B-movie' plot and calling Mysterio a 'human Xerox', incapable of having an original thought in his life; if nothing else, the Kingpin had already attempted to drive Daredevil insane and he had used the 'supernatural intruding on our world' idea in a previous attack on [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Broken in every sense of the word, Mysterio, saying he was stealing an idea from [[Kraven the Hunter]], pulled out a gun and shot himself dead. While Mysterio has faked his own death several times in the past, this act was apparently legitimate, as Mysterio literally had nothing left to live for.<ref name="Dv2#1-7"/>

Sometime later, Quentin Beck suddenly appears in the Midtown High School auditorium in a dark red version of his costume during the three-way battle between Spider-Man and the two successor Mysterios. He confronts Francis Klum before leaving him for Berkhart to deal with. Quentin Beck then confronts [[Miss Arrow]], revealing that half his head is missing from the gunshot wound and explains that, having gone to Hell for suicide, his "superiors" in the afterlife sent him back to Earth to maintain a cosmic balance. His superiors want Spider-Man to continue working at the school and Beck knows Miss Arrow has a similar role for the "other side".

Berkhart and Klum briefly battle one another before Spider-Man captures Berkhart. While trying to escape, Klum runs into Arrow and tries to take her as a hostage, only to be stabbed by one of her stingers. He then teleports away, badly bleeding.<ref name="FNS-M11"/><ref name="FNS-M12"/><ref name="FNS-M13"/> Neither Berkhart nor Klum have been seen since. Though Berkhart was incarcerated, Klum's status is uncertain.

In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #581, a flashback shows that, prior to his suicide, Beck had been hired by Norman Osborn to fake his son Harry's death.

[[Image:Spider-Man Enter-the-Gauntlet Mysterio.jpg|145px|Mysterio returns in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' Art by [[Marcos Martin]].|right|thumb]]
Mysterio reappears during ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline, which re-introduces several past Spider-Man villains with new twists. This Mysterio claims to be a returned Quentin Beck who had faked his death, though it's unclear how this fits in with his aforementioned appearance. He is under the employ of Maggia crime member Carmine, creating androids of various deceased Maggia (including their dead leader [[Silvermane]]) to give them a credibility boost in their gang war with [[Mister Negative]]. Beck controls the Silvermane robot himself and plants seeds of rebellion in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], who had left the Maggia under the belief that Silvermane was deceased. He also tries to drive Spider-Man mad by making him think he's accidentally killed several gang members, while trying to convince him that a returned [[George Stacy|Captain George Stacy]], who claims to have always been the gangster known as the [[Big Man (Marvel Comics characters)|Big Man]], also faked his death years earlier. This turn makes Spider-Man realize that Mysterio must be behind the recent mysterious return of so many deceased individuals, and he vows to have Mysterio pay for making it personal. Shortly after, Mysterio uses the Silvermane robot to murder Carmine in an attempt to secretly seize control of the Maggia and its fortune. Spider-Man eventually exposes and confronts Mysterio, who flees. He later runs into [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], who tells him that he has some friends who are "dying" to meet him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618–620</ref>

The "friends" Chameleon was talking about happens to be the Kravinoffs. He was present at the ritual where Spider-Man is seemingly sacrificed in order to revive [[Kraven the Hunter]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Mysterio is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his villains' team where he is promised that he will receive a reward.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> Mysterio went after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant. He manages to trick Spider-Man into giving him the child by projecting an image of Avengers Mansion and uses his illusions to try to frighten Spider-Man. Ultimately, Spider-Man recovers the baby from Mysterio after figuring out the villain's involvement.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #644</ref>

Mysterio is next seen as part of the new Sinister Six organized by Doctor Octopus. He first works with Chameleon to distract Spider-Man and the Future Foundation, faking an attack in the Caribbean by zombie pirates while the rest of the Six steal something from the Fantastic Four's headquarters.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #659–660</ref> He also participates in an attack by the Six on the [[Avengers Academy]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #14</ref> When the Sinister Six launch an attack on the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]] and their new doomsday weapon, Mysterio is responsible for taking down the [[Red Ghost]] and his [[Super-Apes]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #676</ref>

Doctor Octopus and Mysterio later coordinate the Octobots that have infiltrated the Apogee 1 Space Station. When Mysterio notices that some of the Octobots were disabled, Doctor Octopus orders the Octobots to finish their mission and then destroy the space station. Spider-Man, Human Torch and [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] later discover that some of the space station's crew members have been taken over by the Octobots making them Octobot-controlled zombies that obey Doctor Octopus' commands.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #680</ref> While in their undersea base, Doctor Octopus and Mysterio discover that their Octobot-controlled zombies have passed out. After Apogee 1 Space Station is destroyed and the crew is evacuated by Spider-Man, Human Torch and John Jameson, Doctor Octopus tells the rest of the Sinister Six that his master plan is about to begin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #681</ref>

Although Mysterio aids Doctor Octopus in his attack against the Avengers and his plan to 'heal' the world during the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, he agrees to help Spider-Man, [[Silver Sable]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] defeat Doctor Octopus's plans after Spider-Man convinces him that Doctor Octopus will not honor any deal he has made with the Six as he will almost certainly scorch Earth if his plan succeeds. Mysterio leads Spider-Man and his allies to a Mayan temple where Doctor Octopus's base is located (claiming that he was responsible for the choice of location due to the [[2012 Doomsday Prophecy|supposed Mayan prophecies of the world ending in 2012]]), leaving them to face the mind-controlled Avengers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #686</ref> After disabling the Octobots that were controlling the Avengers, Mysterio lends Spider-Man and Silver Sable his vehicle and provides them with the location of Dr. Octopus' base. He then disappears in a cloud of smoke and leaves the heroes to deal with Octavius.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Men]]'' storyline, Mysterio has crossed over to the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] multiple times only to encounter the mainstream Spider-Man after his last travel. In the struggle, Spider-Man is transported to the Ultimate Universe, where Mysterio reveals that his Ultimate counterpart is simply a [[Life Model Decoy|robotic avatar]] controlled remotely.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #1</ref> Refusing to allow Spider-Man to escape, Mysterio sends a robot avatar after Peter and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|the new Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spider-Men'' #2</ref> Despite using chemical weapons to create the hallucination that both Spider-Men are fighting an army of their greatest foes, Peter's greater experience allows him to focus through Mysterio's illusions and destroy the avatar. Mysterio subsequently departs, reflecting that it is more appropriate to leave Spider-Man trapped in a world where he is dead, leaving [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Iron Man]] to examine his discarded technology.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #3</ref> Mysterio is preparing to cement his victory by destroying the portal and trapping Spider-Man in the Ultimate universe forever. But unable to resist the temptation to see how his enemy is faring, he keeps the portal open long enough for Peter and the Ultimates to capture him. Despite his best efforts to throw them off with their worst fears, Mysterio is quickly defeated. Fury decides to keep him prisoner in the Ultimate universe due to his knowledge of Peter's secret identity.<ref name="Men4">''Spider-Men'' #4</ref> He is later questioned by the Ultimates when [[Galactus]] is accidentally transferred into the Ultimate universe after they determine that Galactus originates from Mysterio's world. Beck reveals that Galactus's past assaults had been defeated by his world's [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]],<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #2</ref> allowing the Ultimates to send [[Ultimate Mister Fantastic|their Reed]] to Earth-616 to hack his counterpart's files on Galactus.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #3</ref>

Eight months after the events of ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'', Mysterio attacks [[Parker Industries]] with the intention of using the company's Webware technology to cause [[mass hysteria]] by beaming imagery directly into the minds of the product's users. The plot is thwarted by [[Deadpool]], who runs Mysterio over with his "Dead-Buggy".<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Joe Kelly|penciller = Ed McGuinness|inker = Mark Morales|colorist = Jason Keith|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Nick Lowe and Jordan D.

After being beaten by the likes of Deadpool and other superheroes, Quentin Beck left the supervillain business and relocated to [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer= Peter David|penciller = William Sliney|inker = William Sliney|colorist = Jason Keith|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Axel Alonso |story = |title = Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider|volume= 1|issue = #9|date = October 25, 2017| publisher = Marvel Comics|location= United States}}</ref> His daughter Misty Beck shows up in order to persuade him to become Mysterio again.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer= Peter David|penciller = William Sliney|inker = William Sliney|colorist = Rachelle Rosenberg|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Devin Lewis, Allison Stock, Nick Lowe |story = |title = Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider|volume= 1|issue = #10|date = November 15, 2017| publisher = Marvel Comics|location= United States}}</ref> [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]] shows some awareness of this, as she warns [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]] about Mysterio,<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #13</ref> but when Reilly visits the villain, he accepts Beck's explanation that he has decided to retire.<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #14</ref> Misty later involves her father in a ritual that would grant her great power if she sacrificed something she truly loved in exchange. But when she attempted to kill Beck, Reilly's intervention distracted her long enough for Beck to accidentally stab her resulting in him gaining the power himself as he places his left hand on the altar while shedding Misty's blood. Now possessing power drawn from [[Cyttorak]], Beck recreates his Mysterio costume and attacks the Scarlet Spider. Scarlet Spider defeats his foe by cutting off the hand that touched the altar, taking away Beck's power. Although it is implied that something is reborn through Misty,<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #19</ref> but it is soon revealed that Misty is actually android that Beck wanted a "daughter".<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #25</ref>

Mysterio later created the illusion of an alien invasion that lured every superhero team to fight them. Spider-Man discovered Mysterio's plot and defeated him. Mysterio stated that he wanted to become more than a lesser criminal as Spider-Man webbed him up for the police. When in court, [[Janice Lincoln]] appeared as Mysterio's lawyer as an unidentified entity's vision appeared in the courthouse claiming to be the one who revived Mysterio.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Ryan Ottley|inker = Cliff Rathburn|colorist = Laura Martin|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe and Kathleen Wisneski|title = Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 5|issue = #1|date = July 11, 2018|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Quentin Beck does not possess superhuman abilities but he is an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master [[hypnotist]] and [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] and an amateur chemist and [[roboticist]]. He has extensive knowledge of hand-to-hand combat techniques learned as a stuntman, allowing him to engage in combat with Spider-Man despite his foe's superior physical abilities and using his skills at misdirection as a further method of self-defense.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13 (June 1964)</ref> Mysterio's suit includes many devices to aid him. His helmet is made of one-way [[plexiglas]], meaning he can see out but no one can see in. The helmet also includes an air supply to protect him from his own gases, sonar to navigate within his mist cloak and a [[holographic]] projector to create 3D illusions. His boots contain magnetic coil springs which allow him impressive leaps as well as the ability to cling to surfaces. Mysterio's costume contains nozzles in the boots and wrists that can release a constant stream of smoke that shields his movements. He can mix other chemicals into this smokescreen for various effects, including a gas that dulls and inhibits Spider-Man's spider-sense, a gas that causes paralysis for 30 minutes, an abrasive that eats away Spider-Man's webbing, hypnogens that make those around him more susceptible to his will and hallucinogens to cause vivid hallucinations. A combination of the hypnogens and hallucinogens, along with his holographic projectors, are how Mysterio achieves most of his illusions. The costume sometimes also includes offensive weaponry, such as lasers or knockout gas nozzles in the eye emblems on his shoulders, or electric coils within his cape to electrocute those who touch it.

After Quentin Beck, there have been several other characters who became his successors after taking his mantle as Mysterio. The second Mysterio ('''Daniel Berkhart''') was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Ross Andru]] and first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #141 (February 1975). The third Mysterio ('''Francis Klum''') was created by [[Kevin Smith]] and [[Terry Dodson]], and he first appeared in ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]'' #1 (August 2002), and became Mysterio in the final issue of the miniseries.<ref name="SMBC6">''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do'' #6</ref> The fourth Mysterio (called "'''Mysterion'''") was created by [[Christopher Yost]] and [[David López (artist)|David Lopez]] and first appeared in ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #22 (June 2013).

===Daniel Berkhart===
After the original Mysterio seemingly dies in prison during an escape attempt, [[J. Jonah Jameson]] hires Daniel Berkhart, a stuntman who had previously worked with Beck, to torment Spider-Man while claiming to be Mysterio's ghost. After he is defeated by Spider-Man, Berkhart explains that Beck had bequeathed some of his equipment to him after his "death", and he felt he owed it to Beck to get revenge. The story leaves it ambiguous whether there is any truth to Berkhart's story or if he was simply covering up Jameson's role in the affair. Berkhart is arrested, despite there being no witnesses to his harassing Spider-Man. He tries to force Jameson to get a lawyer for him by threatening to reveal his involvement to the police, a plot thread which is never resolved.<ref name="AMS141"/>

Later, after Beck's suicide, someone claiming to be Mysterio appears with the revised [[Sinister Six]], making references to his "death", stating how after fighting Daredevil he had exited in a "most spectacular fashion". There was some confusion to this Mysterio's identity until ''Spider-Man: The Mysterio Manifesto'' hinted that it was again Daniel Berkhart. This issue was not addressed again until a Mysterio briefly fought Spider-Man and was captured.<ref>''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' vol. 3 #7</ref> Berkhart was later confirmed to be this second Mysterio by Quentin Beck.<ref name="FNS-M12">''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #12</ref>

The Jack O'Lantern fought by [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] claims to have killed off all of the surviving previous Jack O'Lanterns, leaving Berkhart's status uncertain.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #10–11</ref>

===Francis Klum===
Francis Klum, a mutant with the ability to teleport, was sexually abused by his older brother Garrison (Mr. Brownstone) and forced to use his powers to assist Garrison's illegal activity as a heroin dealer. When Garrison dosed the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] with heroin and attempted to rape her, Francis decided to stop his brother's cruelty for good, teleporting within and blowing up Garrison's body.<ref name="SMBC4">''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]'' #4</ref>

Eventually learning the details of Francis' abusive relationship with Garrison and his role in his brother's death, Felicia nearly convinced Francis to turn himself into the authorities; but [[Spider-Man]], believing that Francis was trying to throw the Cat from the bridge on which they were talking, brutally attacked Klum. Believing that Felicia set him up, he fell from the bridge, teleported in mid-fall and sustained severe physical injuries, losing his left leg below the knee.<ref name="SMBC6"/>

Hungry for revenge against Spider-Man, he contacted the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and purchased the paraphernalia of the currently-deceased Mysterio (Quentin Beck). He reasoned that by using an old enemy's costume, he could put Spider-Man off-guard; Spider-Man would assume he knew who he was dealing with until Klum demonstrated his powers and it was too late for the wall-crawler to do anything about it.<ref name="FNS-M11">''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #11</ref>

However, Klum's plans to kill Spider-Man at Midtown High were interrupted when he was stabbed in the chest by school nurse [[Miss Arrow]]'s stingers after an altercation with the other two Mysterios (Quentin Beck having returned from the dead).<ref name="FNS-M12"/> Klum teleported to safety, although Arrow (who was later revealed to be Ero, a being composed of hundreds of spiders) would later state that her stingers were fatal to anyone except Spider-Man.<ref name="FNS-M13">''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #13</ref> Klum has not been seen since.

===Mysterion===
An unknown African-American individual purchases the suit of Mysterio from [[Roderick Kingsley]] and calls himself Mysterion. He fights the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body) and [[Punisher]]. While keeping Punisher from killing Mysterion, Superior Spider-Man captures Mysterion and places him in containment with Sandman, Electro and Chameleon in his hidden underwater lab.<ref>''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #22</ref> He is later forcibly put under mind control by the Superior Spider-Man and forced to join his Superior Six superhero team.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6</ref> Mysterion escapes with the other members after being freed from Octavius' influence.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7</ref>

Mysterion later attacks [[Liberty Island]] with an army of robot dinosaurs, which are defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]] and other superheroes.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Ryan North|penciller = Erica Henderson|inker = Erica Henderson|colorist = Rico Renzi and Erica Henderson|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Wil Moss|title = The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl|volume = 1|issue = #5|date = May 6, 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

* Mysterio appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]].<ref name="TVoM"/> In the episode "Persona", Quentin Beck was a film special effects expert and stuntman who eventually became one of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s henchmen alongside Phineas Mason.

He bests Spider-Man twice, but Spidey discovers his lair and defeats him after realizing that he does not use magic, but technology and illusions. The tech itself is not a threat, while the illusions cannot fool his spider-sense. Mysterio is seemingly taken to jail, but in the end, it is revealed it was actually a [[robot]] made in Beck's image. When asked why he did this by Tinkerer, he stated that he did not want anyone else taking the credit for his performance as Mysterio.

Since that incident, Spider-Man gave his helmet to Doctor Strange for safekeeping at the Sanctorum. Following his apparent death, his daughter Frances Beck (voiced by [[Mary Kate Wiles]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Mary-Kate-Wiles/|title=Behind The Voice Actors – Mary Kate Wiles|work=Behind The Voice Actors}}</ref> uses his helmet in an attempt to exact revenge on Spider-Man as a female Mysterio only to discover that Quentin Beck's soul is trapped within the helmet. Recalling Doctor Strange's saying "The Enemy of my Enemy is my Friend", Spider-Man casts the spell that would enable Frances' pursuer [[Moon Knight]] to enter when it comes to Mysterio summoning evil elves, giant gingerbread men, snow monsters created from snowmen and animated toys. Using a specific wand that the Moon Knight told him to wield, he stabs the helmet with the wand. Spider-Man pretends to follow the Moon Knight by telling him to free Frances from the helmet's control, after ending up inside the helmet where he sees Quentin in the helmet as a result of a deal with Dormammu.

During the credits, he is sitting in a jail cell feeding goldfish in a bowl.
