==History==
Fabian Stankowicz is a lottery winner who used his winnings to gain notoriety as a supervillain by using his [[engineering]] talent to invent [[powered armor]] suits.<ref name="Avengers #239">''Avengers'' #239. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Under the alias of the Mecho-Marauder, Fabian Stankowicz challenged the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] when he arrived at [[Avengers Mansion]]. Unfortunately for him, the Avengers recognized from the start that he was not a major threat, but rather an annoyance instead. For instance, during his first assault on the Avengers, Fabian Stankowicz was challenged by [[Iron Man]]. The armored hero considered this dilettante so minor a problem that when several fellow Avengers passed by at various times and inquired if their ally needed assistance, Iron Man casually declined and they departed from the scene without comment.<ref>''Avengers'' #217. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After that defeat, Fabian Stankowicz attempted to attack the team multiple times. Using a larger suit of armor, Fabian Stankowicz crashed an Avengers female recruitment [[tea party (social gathering)|tea party]] which was made up of [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], [[Invisible Woman]], [[She-Hulk]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].

Yet Fabian Stankowicz was defeated by [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #96. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He attacked a group of Avengers when they appeared on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. The superheros were at a stalemate, partly because the innocent audience members were in danger and the villain's use of forcefields. [[David Letterman]] recognized that he was in reach of the man; he knocked out Fabian Stankowicz with one swing of a large prop doorknob. Fabian tried to run away, but was caught by [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].<ref name="Avengers #239"/>

Wanting to reform, Fabian Stankowicz under the alias of Mechanaut joined [[Blue Shield (comics)|Blue Shield]], [[Gladiatrix (comics)|Gladiatrix]], and [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] into applying for membership in the Avengers.
