==Publication history==

==Fictional character biography==
In 1972, nearly twenty years before [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] was romantically involved and abducted with [[Silver Fox (comics)|Silver Fox]] at Windsor snow lodge, Professor Thorton experimented on numerous mutants including [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and [[Mastodon (comics)|Mastodon]].{{issue|date=January 2015}} He hired [[Carol Hines]] as his assistant and the scientist [[Abraham Cornelius]]. His experiments on Wolverine are responsible for his adamantium-laced skeleton.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #73</ref> He is also connected to the creation of [[Alpha Flight]] on to developing super-soldiers for the US government.{{issue|date=January 2015}} During the adamantium-lacing process, the physical trauma causes Wolverine to regress to violent animal behavior, prone to attacking anyone who comes near.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #74</ref> At one point, Thorton's mysterious "master" takes control of Wolverine and has him attack everyone in the facility, cutting off Professor Thorton's right hand and killing him.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #79-83</ref> Though an ending scene clarifies to the reader that this was a virtual reality simulation of an escape attempt by Wolverine,<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #84</ref> in later appearances Thorton has a metal hook in place of his right hand.

Years later, Professor Thorton and Carol Hines lure Wolverine into an abandoned warehouse in Canada which was once the secret location for the Weapon X program. Codenamed Project X, Wolverine discovers Weapon X was funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and sheltered in Canada. Professor Thorton activates a robotic android named Shiva which is programmed to destroy all of Project X's test subjects starting with Wolverine. Silver Fox (who works for another secret organization called [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]) is revealed to be behind the entire plan and steps forward to interrogate Professor Thorton at gunpoint. He tries to grab the gun from Silver Fox, and she shoots him fatally.<ref>''Wolverine'' #50</ref>

It was shown that [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]] was in control of Weapon X and gave orders to Truett both observing Wolverine as he was unconscious.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #33</ref> Although it is stated that Romulus had known Logan in a past life, it is unclear if he knew of Logan while he was young and living at the Howlett estate if this he did then he would have known of Truett's connection to Logan.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #36</ref>
