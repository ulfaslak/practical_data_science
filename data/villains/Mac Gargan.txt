==Fictional character biography==

===Scorpion===
[[File:Scorpion (Mac Gargan) early depiction.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mac Gargan as Scorpion, as he initially portrayed in the retelling of his origin on ''Spidey'' #11 (October 2016). Art by Nathan Stockman.]]
Mac Gargan was a [[private investigator]] initially hired by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to find out how Peter Parker is able to obtain incredible pictures of [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #19</ref> Gargan's efforts set off Peter's spider-sense and the teen easily evades the detective. Jameson then decides to hire Gargan as the subject of a barely-tested process that would endow him with the useful characteristics of a particular animal with the help of Dr. [[Farley Stillwell]]. Dr. Stillwell also outfits him with a club-like mechanical tail. In this case, a [[scorpion]] is the base for the purposes of creating a powerful agent capable of defeating Spider-Man as the scorpion is a natural predator of the spider. The Scorpion proves to be more than a match for Spider-Man, defeating him twice, but the mutagenic treatment seriously affects Gargan's mind, driving him [[Insanity|insane]] as the predatory instincts of the scorpion take over. He promptly turns on his benefactor but Spider-Man intervenes, and finally defeats the Scorpion in their third battle.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #20">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #20</ref> The Scorpion becomes a professional criminal and returns to indulge in a vendetta against Spider-Man and Jameson, only to be defeated again.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #29</ref>

He is later hired by a spy ring to follow [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Sharon Carter]], but is defeated by [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #122</ref> Scorpion is acquired by Mr. Kline, who creates an android duplicate of him.<ref>''Daredevil'' #82</ref> The real Scorpion and Mr. Hyde launch a campaign of terror against S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, but are defeated by Captain America and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].<ref>''Captain America'' #151-152</ref> After being released from prison for good behavior, the Scorpion hunts down Spider-Man and tries drowning him in a cement vat, hoping to use the boost to his reputation to become an underworld boss. Scorpion learns that Spider-Man survived the encounter, and the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] gives him Spider-Man's location. The Scorpion arrives at a hospital room with Peter Parker and his [[Aunt May]]. Not recognizing Spider-Man in his civilian identity, he threatens May and demands to know where Spider-Man is. After she faints, Scorpion rampages through the hospital. A furious Spider-Man beats the Scorpion and makes him apologize to May.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #145-146</ref>

The Scorpion fights [[Ms. Marvel]] after a botched revenge attempt against Jameson; the Scorpion becomes more psychotic than usual after this, resulting in his being dumped in acid.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #1-2</ref> In the sewers, his sanity deteriorating, Scorpion comes to believe that his costume cannot be taken off. After a quick encounter, Spider-Man proves that his belief of being a monster is only in his mind.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #21</ref> Gargan forms an extortion racket to sabotage the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', but is thwarted by Spider-Man and Captain America.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #106</ref> He is freed from prison by agents of [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], who wants him to join the third [[Masters of Evil]] alongside [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] and [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]]. The team fight the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] but are defeated.<ref>''Avengers'' #222</ref> Scorpion kidnaps Jameson's bride Marla Madison on their wedding day but she is rescued by Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #18</ref> Jonah publicly confesses to his role in creating the Scorpion when the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] tries to use that secret to blackmail him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #251</ref> Despite his encounters with other foes, Scorpion has always had a special hatred for Spider-Man and Jameson, which extends to when he attempts to become a mercenary for [[Justin Hammer]], who has the Scorpion's battlesuit modified. He ruins his prospects on his first mission, to capture a war hero, when he cannot resist creating a [[hostage situation]] simply to bring Jameson to him for revenge. In reaction, Hammer sends [[Blacklash]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] to subdue Gargan and confiscate the tail enhancement equipment for abrogating his contract.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #318-319</ref>

During the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'', he tries to enter Canada to avoid the Super Power Registration Act. The [[Tinkerer]] meets him at the airport and provides him with a modified scorpion tail for his costume. He, [[Asp (comics)|Asp]], [[Nekra]], and [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] (who are under the control of [[Llan the Sorcerer]]) are repelled by [[Alpha Flight]] and [[Gamma Flight]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #79-80</ref> He is then hired by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to kill a depowered Spider-Man. He is defeated by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #342-343</ref> The Scorpion's constant defeats at the hands of Spider-Man drive him to depression. He wanders the sewers, his mind becoming clearer than it had been since his transformation, and decides to quit being the Scorpion. He encounters a depressed and crisis-ridden Spider-Man. Ignoring Gargan's plea that he is a changed man, Spider-Man beats him savagely.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #215-216</ref> In his next appearance, Gargan is back to being psychopathic. He battles and is defeated by Spider-Man's clone [[Ben Reilly]].<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #13</ref>

Scorpion temporarily works for [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]] and helps them in their phony "rehabilitation therapy". Roxxon updates the Scorpion's powers and costume and promises he will get back at his enemies. Spider-Man convinces Scorpion that he is only being used. Scorpion then turns on Roxxon and is then defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #22</ref> Gargan reappears in the aftermath of the [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] that was organized by [[Nick Fury]] against [[Latveria]]. He is among the supervillains who were supplied with enhanced technology by Latverian dictator [[Lucia von Bardas]] and sent to attack the heroes involved in Fury's Secret War. The villains' technologies are hijacked by von Bardas, supplying her with power, potentially at the cost of the villains' lives, but the assembled heroes defeat von Bardas and apprehend Scorpion and the others{{Issue|date=April 2009}}.

===Venom===

{{Main|Venom (Marvel Comics character)}}
Later on through circumstances yet to be revealed, [[Norman Osborn]] reveals Spider-Man's true identity to Gargan and gives him orders to kidnap Peter's Aunt May should Osborn ever be captured and imprisoned. When Spider-Man defeats Osborn, he is imprisoned and Gargan carries out Osborn's orders in kidnapping Aunt May. Gargan eventually summons Peter and tells him the only way he can see his aunt again is to break Norman out of jail. Shortly thereafter, the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote approaches Gargan,<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #9</ref> offering him new abilities, and Gargan becomes bonded with the creature.{{issue|date=September 2018}} This would later give him an extra edge as part of Norman Osborn's [[Sinister Six|Sinister Twelve]].<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #10</ref> Even with these additional powers he is still swiftly defeated by Spider-Man, as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] deal with the rest of the Twelve.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #11</ref> Though incarcerated,<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #12</ref> Gargan is unfazed, as with his new powers come the respect of becoming an "A-list" villain at last.{{issue|date=September 2018}}

Alongside Spider-Man and other villains and heroes, Venom is [[Beyond!|kidnapped by other-dimensional forces]]. He succeeds in killing Spider-Man, who is really the original [[Space Phantom]] in disguise.<ref>''Beyond!'' #1</ref> For his crimes, the [[Inhumans]] matriarch [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] orders his execution and almost carries it out herself. Later, he tries to kill the other participants for the [[Beyonder]]'s wish fulfillment prize for the winner,<ref>''Beyond!'' #2</ref> but fails and is returned to Earth alongside the rest of the group.<ref>''Beyond!'' #6</ref>

===Thunderbolts===
Gargan later becomes a member of a sub-group of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]],<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #4</ref> which has been drafted by the Avengers to hunt down the members of the fugitive Secret Avengers and is currently run by the Commission for Superhuman Activities.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: Choosing Sides]]'' #1</ref> It is then revealed that he has been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the Venom symbiote in check.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #2</ref> As a Thunderbolt, he is seen as a hero by the general public and has his own action figures.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #110</ref> Gargan displays his new raw power as Venom in a battle with [[Jack Flag]], after pummeling Flag for a bit, the hero manages to stab Gargan, who is protected by the symbiote. Gargan becomes enraged and ferociously man-handles Flag, and is about to eat him when his electrical implants kick in and temporarily subdue him, allowing Flag to live.<ref name="Thunderbolts #111">''Thunderbolts'' #111</ref> Gargan expresses fear of the control the symbiote possesses over him, yet he has become addicted to the raw unearthly power it brings to him and cannot even begin to imagine life without it, similar to a drug addict.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #112</ref> An attack from [[Steel Spider]] and [[Shadowoman|Sepulchre]] makes him lose control again, briefly becoming a huge monster once more, while Moonstone is incapacitated and thus cannot coordinate control of his electrical implants.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #114</ref> Afterwards he returns to a normal form with no ill effects. He also bites off and devours Steel Spider's arm during a fight.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #115</ref>

Gargan is later ordered by Osborn to hunt down [[Namor]]. After shooting him with a Thunderbolts-supplied weapon, Gargan disables Namor by ripping off his feet-wings. The Sub-Mariner manages to render Gargan unconscious and then rips out the symbiote's tongue,<ref>''[[Sub-Mariner]]'' 2007 limited-series{{Issue|date=December 2010}}</ref> although the symbiote easily makes a new one. Gargan begins to hallucinate that the symbiote is speaking to him, telling him to "feed (it)". He later attacks and devours a guard and declares that "the only way out of Thunderbolts Mountain is when I decide to let you die".<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #118</ref> It is later revealed that the psychic criminal [[Blue Streak (comics)#Bluestreak (psychic)|Bluestreak]] is controlling Gargan's actions, although it is uncertain whether the symbiote was actually speaking to him or not.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #119</ref> Venom goes up against the [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]], who stabs Gargan through the chest, using his powers to force the symbiote away from his sword. Gargan is wounded, but lives.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #120</ref> After healing, he retains his monstrous form, rarely returning to his usual size.

==="New Ways to Die"===
Gargan reappears during the "New Ways to Die" story arc of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', no longer possessing the knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16246 |title=CBR News: Enemies at the Gates: Wacker Talks "Amazing Spider-Man" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2011-02-08}}</ref> Gargan and the Thunderbolts are called back to New York to capture Spider-Man. While on a search for the wall-crawler, Gargan's symbiote senses a former host nearby. Gargan suspects that it is Spider-Man but instead finds [[Eddie Brock]] at the F.E.A.S.T center (a soup kitchen). The Venom symbiote attempts to leave Gargan to re-bond with Brock, much to Gargan's (and Brock's) dismay. Upon making contact with Brock, his skin is shown to be caustic to his former symbiote, and as a white substance seeps out of his pores covering his body, Brock uses the [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]] symbiote and battles Gargan. With some help from Spider-Man, Anti-Venom subdues Venom and nearly destroys the symbiote.<ref>{{Comic book reference| writer=[[Dan Slott]]| penciller=[[John Romita Jr.]]| story="New Ways to Die"|title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]| volume=| issue=#569| date=August 2008|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]| page=| panel=}}</ref> Norman Osborn uses a sample of Anti-Venom's DNA from Mac Gargan and creates a poisonous counter to its healing powers by combining the sample with the immune system of [[Freak (Marvel Comics)#Freak (Spider-Man villain)|Freak]]. Mac Gargan is injected with the "cure" and is given a new Scorpion battlesuit, which contains the venom, until the symbiote can recover.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #572</ref> Anti-Venom tracks down Gargan at Oscorp. After a grueling battle "Ven-orpion" injects the toxin into Anti-Venom and seemly kills the suit. He then attempts to kill Brock but the symbiote tries holding him back, still feeling love for its former host. The symbiote gains its strength and breaks though the Scorpion suit. Gargan gives up but promises that he will get past this problem and will someday finish Brock.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #573</ref>

===''Secret Invasion''===
Gargan was seen being thrown from Thunderbolt Mountain by [[Captain Marvel (Khn'nr)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #3</ref> Gargan was later seen with the other Thunderbolts in Washington. The [[Skrull]]s attempt to trick him into killing normal humans in order to find out which of them are Skrulls.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #123</ref> Osborn attempted to prevent the symbiote from killing anyone by threatening to kill Mac Gargan and promising to help satisfy his "urges" later, only for Gargan to reveal that the threat he appeared to pose to civilians was a ruse in order to draw out a disguised Skrull. Venom played a huge part in fighting the Skrulls. He was seen slashing and eating the Skrulls all at once.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #124</ref> He soon joins the Thunderbolts and the remaining heroes for the final battle against the Skrulls. During the battle, he was a force to be reckoned with.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7</ref>

Venom, along with most of the Thunderbolts team, attempts to kill partner [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] on the orders of Osborn. Facing Venom, Songbird was defeated and almost eaten by Venom, but escaped with help from the Swordsman.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #127</ref>

===''Dark Reign''===
[[File:Dark Reign Sinister Spider-Man.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Mac Gargan as Spider-Man. Art By [[Mike Deodato Jr]].]]
Norman Osborn forms the [[Dark Avengers]], providing new identities to some of his former Thunderbolts. After feeding a [[Skrull]] to a hungry Venom that has become more bestial than human, Osborn gives him a medication that resets the symbiote to the size it was when it possessed Spider-Man originally. Gargan can transform into his larger Venom form at will.

Norman introduces Gargan and the symbiote as "'''[[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Other Spider-Men and Women in the Marvel Universe|Spider-Man]]'''" of the Dark Avengers.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1</ref> During their first mission against [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgana le Fay]], Morgana transforms "Venom-Spidey" into a giant, demonic monster who then tries to eat [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]].<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #2</ref> Venom later coughs up Ares; however, Morgana's magic continues to affect Venom, causing him to lose and gain control of himself randomly.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #3</ref> After Morgana is defeated in the past by Iron Patriot and [[Doctor Doom]], Mac returned to his "Spider-Man" form with only a slight headache. [[Bullseye (comics)|Hawkeye]] promised to kill Mac one day for trying to eat him while he was under Morgana's control.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #4</ref> Once they arrive home, he is seen arguing with Hawkeye.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #5</ref>

Later, attempting to find out Norman Osborn's plans for his son [[Harry Osborn|Harry]], the real Spider-Man, with the aid of the [[Invisible Woman]], manages to capture Gargan by using a sonic generator and takes his place to infiltrate the Dark Avengers. Gargan is thrown into the [[Negative Zone]],<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #596</ref> but is later seen back with the Dark Avengers.

Against Osborn's wishes, Gargan is seen heading out into the city to "fight crime" solo. At one point, he is seen defeating a bank robber called General Wolfram. After making out with two girls at once and getting cheered by a large crowd, he takes the robber to an abandoned rooftop and consumes his arm. He then takes the money Wolfram stole and swings away. Gargan is then seen at a [[strip club]] with the money and discovers his new favorite stripper. After getting reprimanded by Norman Osborn for eating Wolfram's arm, Gargan kills the stripper and places her dead body in J. Jonah Jameson's bed while he is gone in an attempt to frame him for her murder. At the same time, Redeemer visits the injured General Wolfram and recruits him alongside other villains who have had limbs bitten off by Gargan (namely Dementoid, Doctor Everything, Eleven, and Hippo) in a plan to take down "Spider-Man" (who is believed to be the root of their problem).<ref>''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #1</ref> In another attempt to antagonize Jameson, Gargan instigates a turf war between two rival street gangs, hoping to wear Jameson down through stress and exhaustion from continuously putting out stories to cover the crime wave. At the same time, the Redeemer arms his group with cybernetic limbs to defeat Spider-Man. J. Jonah Jameson goes to Osborn for help and is given Spider-Man to help solve the city's gang problem.<ref>''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #2</ref>

Gargan continues to instigate the gang war and aggravate Jameson in person. A bomb threat is placed by Redeemer to lure Spider-Man into an intervention, though Gargan instead devours Hippo and Eleven, badly injures Dementoid, and beats Doctor Everything into submission before turning him over to the police. He then eats Redeemer's limbs. With Redeemer, Wolfram, and Dementoid the only ones still remaining of the group (albeit hospitalized), Redeemer sends photos of Gargan's actions to Jameson in an attempt to expose him as a cannibalistic psychopath to the world.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #3</ref> Jameson first goes to Osborn, who decides to cut Gargan loose by sending Bullseye and [[Daken]] (in their old costumes) to kill him. At the Big Apple Festival, the two attack him, with Dementoid, General Wolfram, and both gangs involved in the turf war entering the fray to try to kill Spider-Man. Gargan ends up defeating all of them, and J. Jonah Jameson shoots a gun in the air to stop the fight. As a result, everyone credits Jameson and Spider-Man with successfully working together to stop criminals and save the festival. Gargan later returns to Avengers Tower, where he is visited by Norman Osborn. Osborn informs him that Bullseye and Daken will get over being hurt, but warns Gargan that if he goes out of control again, he will suit up as the Iron Patriot and take care of him personally.<ref>''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #4</ref>

During the opening chapter of ''[[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]]'', the Dark Avengers are sent into San Francisco to quell the mutant riots and battle any X-Men they can find. Tension is shown to exist between the Avengers and Osborn's own [[Dark X-Men]]. When [[Namor]] and [[Emma Frost]] are revealed to be [[double agent]]s on [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops']] side and defect with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], an irate Osborn gathers the Dark Avengers and the remaining Dark X-Men, Gargan included, ordering them to bring him Namor's head and Emma Frost's heart and to make sure that Cyclops sees them do it.<ref>''Dark Avengers #8''</ref> The Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men attack Utopia and battle the X-Men, with Venom facing off against [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Due to the sheer number of X-Men, Osborn is forced to retreat when informed that the only way to win would be to kill all the mutants on the island, an option which is not politically viable.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus''</ref>

Gargan later begins to show signs that his medications are making him emotionally unstable. On a mission with the Dark Avengers, Osborn takes Gargan off the case when he notices Gargan's outbursts.<ref name="Dark Avengers #10">''Dark Avengers'' #10</ref> [[Molecule Man]] turns Gargan and his symbiote into an inert pile of goo.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #11</ref> He is later restored by the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]{{Issue|date=January 2010}}.

==="Siege"===
During the "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]" storyline, Mac Gargan is with the Dark Avengers when Norman Osborn makes plans to invade [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. Mac Gargan and the rest of the Avengers protest. For fighting alongside the Initiative, Osborn promises to give the team their freedom from servitude. As a result, Gargan is among the mass of soldiers to launch an attack on Asgard following [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]'s setup. He and the rest of the Avengers manage to overwhelm [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Siege'' #1</ref> While fighting Ms. Marvel and Spider-Man after they arrive, Gargan is forcefully removed from the Venom symbiote, which takes over Ms. Marvel until Spider-Man defeats it.<ref>''Siege: Spider-Man'' #1</ref> He, along with the other Dark Avengers, are arrested after Norman Osborn falls from power.<ref>''Siege'' #4</ref>

===Return as Scorpion===
During the "[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]" storyline, Mac Gargan is seen at the Raft superprison, having been separated from the Venom symbiote: the symbiote's removal was causing medical problems due to the side effects from his original genetic mutation. [[Alistair Smythe]] breaks him out of the Raft.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #650</ref> Gargan was then fitted with a new Scorpion suit by Smythe, which included a life-support system to stabilize Gargan's condition. Smythe convinced Gargan to join him in his plan for revenge on J. Jonah Jameson.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #651">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #651</ref> Scorpion joins Alistair Smythe, a new villain named Fly-Girl, and some unnamed cyborg minions (each wanting revenge on Jameson) in attacking the launch site of [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]'s latest space mission, where they sabotage the launch and hold John Jameson for ransom.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #652</ref>

During the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Scorpion is seen guarding one of Doctor Octopus' facilities. [[Titanium Man]] enters it and ends up fighting Scorpion. Titanium Man is defeated by Scorpion despite his best efforts.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Dying Wish]]'' storyline, Scorpion hears the call-to-arms from Peter Parker (while trapped in Doctor Octopus' dying body) to save him and apprehend Doctor Octopus (occupying Spider-Man's body) in order to save his loved ones from Doctor Octopus' final sinister scheme.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #699</ref> Scorpion and [[Hydro-Man]] accompany Peter Parker in Doctor Octopus' body to Stark Industries to look for [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] only to end up in a trap set by Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body. When finding a safe area containing Spider-Man's friends and relatives, Scorpion plans to have his final revenge on J. Jonah Jameson. Upon accessing the memories of Spider-Man loving Aunt May - and the times Scorpion threatened her - Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body retaliates by punching Scorpion so hard in the jaw (the only unprotected part of his body) that it breaks off from his head.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700</ref>

Scorpion was later seen in the Raft's infirmary with Boomerang and Vulture. Scorpion now sported a metal apparatus that replaced his missing jaw. Alistair Smythe's mini-Spider-Slayers heal and enhance them, and Smythe gives them an offer to kill Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11</ref> While Boomerang fights Spider-Man, Scorpion is convinced by Smythe to go after Mayor Jameson again.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #12</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Scorpion is among the villains at [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s viewing party of the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Scorpion was secretly hired by Tiberius Stone of [[Alchemax]] to further test Alchemax's Spider-Slayers during Tiberius' trip to a foreign country to sell them. During Scorpion's test of Alchemax's Spider-Slayers, Scorpion encountered [[Spider-Man 2099]].<ref name="auto">''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 2 #3</ref> When Scorpion thought that Spider-Man 2099 was his Spider-Man in a different costume, he attacks him with the aid of the Spider-Slayers. Spider-Man 2099 was able to use his holographic assistant to project a hologram of Spider-Man over Scorpion causing the Spider-Slayers to attack Scorpion until he turned them off twice.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

Scorpion later doubles working for Black Cat's gang when he and a man named Lee Price partake in a black market sale that also involved Tombstone's gang.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 3 #1</ref> When at Black Cat's hideout, Scorpion accuses Lee Price of botching up the black market sale which Lee Price denied leading Black Cat to demand an explanation after hearing about some information from her spies at the New York City Police Department telling her what they know. After Lee Price leaves following his explanation, Scorpion becomes suspicious towards Lee.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 3 #2</ref> While confiding his suspicions, Mac Gargan dons a new version of the Scorpion armor.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 3 #3</ref> He then meets Price at the apartment of a Daily Bugle reporter, who had evidence against Black Cat. When Lee reminds him that they should scare the reporter, Scorpion attacks him causing Lee to transform into Venom and the two begin to fight. During the fight, Scorpion is nearly killed until Spider-Man intervenes, who mistook Venom for Flash Thompson.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 3 #4-5</ref>

Before he assumed the identity of the Scorpion, Mac Gargan was a skilled, if somewhat greedy and unscrupulous, private investigator, who admitted that he would go through anything "just so long as the pay is good!"<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #20"/> His greed still motivated him as a supervillain, albeit in a twisted way: while awaiting an official "offer" from the Thunderbolts, Gargan squeezed his agent for financial details on a proposed book, TV and movie deal ("How many back points? And residuals? Fantastic. That foreign ''and ''domestic?"), demanded certain talent for the writing (including [[Eric Guggenheim|the screenwriting brother]] of [[Marc Guggenheim|the comic's writer]]) and, finally, Gargan killed six "capekiller" [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents sent to bring him in - because while he intended to cooperate, his agent had told him that the rights to his life story would be "worth a little more" if Gargan "goosed up the body count" before joining the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Civil War: Choosing Sides'' #1 (Dec. 2006)</ref>

He is emotionally disturbed as a result of the procedure in which he acquired his powers, and retains little of his former rationality. He is typically easily outsmarted by Spider-Man and is not very good at cooperating with other supervillains or following instructions as Justin Hammer learned. His most prominent weakness is his explosive temper and irrational hatred toward J. Jonah Jameson, to the point where he has been known to ignore the orders of whomever he is working for, in order to attack the ''Daily Bugle's'' publisher{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. None of this has changed with his bonding to the Venom symbiote, or with his new career serving under Norman Osborn with the Thunderbolts or the Dark Avengers: in fact, the symbiote seems to have only made him even more irrational, and his new career as a "hero" has done nothing to curtail his lingering hatred of Jameson{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. He nearly blew his cover as Spider-Man when he started a drug war and photographs of him engaging in cannibalism wound up in J. Jonah Jameson's hands, putting his employer [[Norman Osborn]]'s plans and the "heroic" status of his entire [[Dark Avengers]] team in jeopardy, just to pursue vengeance against Jameson (now the Mayor of New York) yet again. His ill-conceived and poorly thought-out plan failed, and he was forced to publicly make peace with Jameson in his Spider-Man guise, greatly embarrassing him, though he secretly fantasized about killing Jameson during the whole time while they were shaking hands{{Issue|date=November 2009}}.

The years of being outsmarted and beaten, despite his physical superiority over Spider-Man, complement the similar hatred possessed by the symbiote, and has allowed it to almost completely control Gargan. Unlike the other Venoms, Mac very seldom refers to himself as "we" instead of "I". Gargan has even engaged in [[cannibalism]] as Venom, severing and devouring the arm of the still-living [[Steel Spider]]. After getting "the taste of flesh", he is seen displaying even more signs of cannibalism such as eating Skrulls, consuming the bones of [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], devouring Eleven and the limbs of criminals, and trying to eat Ares. When the symbiote is dormant in his body he has expressed nausea and fear of the organism.<ref>''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #112</ref> Unlike [[Eddie Brock]], any inhibitions Gargan had about harming innocent bystanders has been eliminated with his bonding to the symbiote, most likely because he had such little regard for others to begin with. Gargan's [[#Scorpion|previous identity]] has not been completely degraded. His [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] once sprouted a scorpion-like tail, although he has not had it since. Also, when he learned there was a [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|new hero]] calling herself the Scorpion, Gargan-Venom attacked her to protect his trademark while it still lasted. Also, for a brief time, Gargan wore a new Scorpion suit while the symbiote regenerated after Anti-Venom's attack, although initially he was hesitant about wearing it alongside the symbiote.

==Powers and abilities==
===As Scorpion===
Mac Gargan, as the Scorpion, was given superhuman powers through chemical and radiological treatments, include splicing his genetics with a scorpion's DNA, which produced mutagenic effects. As the result, he has [[arachnid]]-like powers similar to Spider-Man's such as superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, and durability, and also can scale walls (he also punches holes in walls as a way to climb). He also has an exceptionally strong grip, reminiscent of a real scorpion's pincers. He wears a full-body battlesuit composed of two layers of light steel mesh separated by a thin layer of insulated rubber. In addition to his superhuman physique, he was traditionally armed with a cybernetically-controlled, seven-foot mechanical tail, with a tool steel articulated framework which can whip at 90 miles per hour. The tail has in the past been equipped with projectile weapons, usually an electric generator, although it has also been equipped with a spike at its tip, which can squirt an acidic spray, and a low-density plasma energy projector. The Scorpion can use his tail as an extra leg, or he can coil it behind him to spring himself a distance of at least 30 feet. The Scorpion is substantially stronger and more durable than Spider-Man, though is a much less skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and thus Spider-Man relies on his tactics and wits to defeat him.

===As Venom===
With the Venom symbiote, Mac Gargan retains his superhuman abilities, some of which have increased substantially beyond the original levels. The costume can even emulate the tail of Gargan's Scorpion costume. It can also be used as a fifth limb{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. As Venom, Gargan has gained the ability to shoot webbing and climb walls like Spider-Man, and can disguise himself as other people or blend in with his background. He is undetectable by Spider-Man's "spider-sense". His skill as a hand-to-hand combatant has increased due to the influence of the alien symbiote, which has superior instincts and fighting experience. The costume can also heal grave injuries suffered by the host with incredible speed. Mac (as Venom) has claws on his fingers which can be used as weapons to slash his foes. He can also create tendrils to incapacitate his enemies.

When injured or enraged, Venom now has the ability to increase its mass and physical strength in order to meet whatever threat it is facing with equal force, an ability inconsistently hinted in the past, such as when Venom battled the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. During these times it is not clear that Gargan has any control over the symbiote, for had it not been for the technology restraining Venom, he would have eaten [[Jack Flag]]. Also, during a battle with the [[Steel Spider]], Gargan attacks innocent bystanders.<ref name="Thunderbolts #111"/>

===As Spider-Man===
A special "medication" provided by Norman Osborn allowed Venom to assume a smaller, more human-looking form similar to when Spider-Man had control of the symbiote. From this form, he is able to switch back to his larger, more feral form whenever he pleases. As Spider-Man, Mac seems to be even more agile than when he was as Venom. He also still has all of Venom's powers, minus the claws, tongue, and teeth, which he can regrow at will.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> His "medication" has also been shown to decrease his will to fight, making him more sympathetic.<ref name="Dark Avengers #10"/>

===Return as Scorpion===
After Smythe breaks him out of the Raft, Gargan is fitted with a new Scorpion suit. The suit is larger than its predecessor, and cybernetically wired into Gargan, making him a [[cyborg]]. It is equipped with a more powerful tail, mechanical pincers, and is bulletproof. Smythe also altered Gargan's biology, giving him a "scorpion-sense" to match Spider-Man's spider-sense. The suit is also very tough, allowing Gargan to withstand a fall at terminal speed.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #651"/> The armor leaves Mac's jaw unprotected, which Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body exploited to punch his jaw clean off.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #700</ref> Following his employment by Alchemax, he has gained a new jaw to replace the jaw he lost.<ref name="auto"/>

==Other versions==
===Exiles===
In one of the many realities visited by the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], Mac Gargan is one of the many superhumans that form the [[Heroes for Hire]], and is part of the ''Avengers Package'', which also includes the Black Widow and the Black Knight. After being hired to protect Tokyo from [[Moses Magnum]] and [[Namorita]], Scorpion is killed by the murderous, teenage counterpart of [[Magik (comics)|Magik]].<ref>''Exiles'' #26-27</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] comics feature '''Maximus Gargan''', a tattoed Mexican mob boss that worked with the [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] (Aaron Davis).<ref name="ReferenceB">''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #6</ref> This Gargan is the second villain to take on the alias of Scorpion, the first being a deranged, imperfect clone of Peter Parker. He is shown to have very resistant skin, but may have other powers as well.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Once he arrived at New York, Gargan set his sights on becoming the new "Kingpin of New York", but was stopped by the efforts of an un-easy alliance of [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]] and Prowler.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #10</ref>

===''JLA/Avengers''===
In the last issue of ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Scorpion is among the enthralled villains defending Krona's stronghold, and is defeated by [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
A zombified Scorpion appears in ''[[Marvel Zombies: Dead Days]]'' and ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]''. He is a member of the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s undead alliance. As such, he searches New York and the surrounding areas for food of any kind. He is on friendly terms with the zombie [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]]. He is eventually killed by [[Machine Man]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #3 (2008)</ref>

===''Spider-Man: Reign''===
Gargan appears as the Scorpion (in a highly advanced costume) in ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'' as a member of the [[Sinister Six|Sinner Six]]<!--YES, it IS Sinner Six, see [[Spider-Man: Reign]]. Do not edit this out! -->. He dies when he is punted from an [[Empire State Building]] window by Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Man: Reign'' #1-4</ref>

===''Spider-Verse''===
In the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'', the Earth-001 version of Scorpion is a member of Verna's [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]]. Alongside the Earth-001 version of Rhino, Scorpion accompanied Verna to Earth-21205 to hunt Hobgoblin (who was the identity of that world's Peter Parker). They were stopped by the Spider-Woman of Earth-65.<ref>''Spider-Verse Team-Up'' #2</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* The Mac Gargan version of Scorpion appeared in the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Carl Banas]].<ref name="TVoS">{{cite web|title=The Voices of Scorpion|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Spider-Man/Scorpion/|publisher=Behind The Voice Actors}}</ref> He is introduced in the episode "Never Step on a Scorpion" in which his creation is shown. It is revealed that his villainy is apparently due to the experiment making his evil nature increase. Scorpion returns in the episode "Sting of the Scorpion" where he breaks out of prison to wreak revenge on [[J. Jonah Jameson]] by kidnapping him. Scorpion accidentally takes a formula which makes him grow to 20 feet tall while breaking into Stillwell's home and trying to find the formula that gave him his superhuman strength, but [[Spider-Man]] gives him the antidote and he is jailed again.
* The Mac Gargan version of Scorpion appeared in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]''.<ref name="TVoS"/> Seen in the episode "Attack of the Arachnoid", he was thwarted by the Spider-Friends (Spider-Man, [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]]) at the beginning of the episode. When Spider-Man ends up in jail for Zolton's actions to frame the real Spider-Man, Scorpion took this opportunity to deliver payback to Spider-Man only to be defeated.

[[Image:spidermanep2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Scorpion in the 1990s ''Spider-Man'' animated series.]]
* The Mac Gargan version of Scorpion appeared in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced initially by [[Martin Landau]] (until his [[Academy Award]] win and subsequent lack of availability) and later by [[Richard Moll]].<ref name="TVoS"/> This version is initially depicted as a neurotic, plump, and balding private eye working for J. Jonah Jameson. In an attempt to discover Spider-Man's real identity, Jameson convinces Gargan to be transformed into a capable superhero by Dr. Stillwell using the [[Neogenic Recombinator]]. As Scorpion, he is able to defeat Spider-Man by pulling a water tower onto Spider-Man, but before he can unmask the wall-crawler, he is overcome with pain as he undergoes further uncontrolled mutations that give him green skin, yellow eyes, and talon-like fingers which also drives him insane. Believing more radiation may stop his transformation and return him to normal, he attempts to gain access to a nuclear reactor (where he plans to release it would have destroyed all of New York City) but is found and defeated by Spider-Man, resulting in Scorpion being sent to jail. Scorpion reappears as a member of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s [[Sinister Six|supervillain team]] alongside the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Mysterio (comics)|Mysterio]] and [[Doctor Octopus]] to kill Spider-Man though he is again defeated by Spider-Man. Desperate to find a cure to his condition, Scorpion kidnaps Stillwell but Stillwell destroys the Neogenic Recombinator to prevent the creation of other beings like Scorpion. After meeting the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Scorpion kidnaps Vulture from an exploding building to hold hostage, believing Vulture to be smart enough to undo his Scorpion transformation. Eventually, [[Alistair Smythe]], requiring Scorpion's genetic code to further his own experiments, holds the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] hostage to coerce Spider-Man into bringing Scorpion. Scorpion eventually manages to escape Smythe's clutches due to Vulture attacking and attempts to stay away from crime. Scorpion's final appearance is again as a member of the Insidious Six who attempt to locate the [[Red Skull]]'s [[doomsday device]] for Kingpin. At the end of the episode, he is shown to have escaped the police and went back to his own life.
* Mac Gargan is alluded in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In the [[series finale]] "Final Curtain", the Chameleon (disguised as Norman Osborn) thanks the private investigator on the phone for investigating [[Donald Menken]]'s address.

[[Spider-Man]] interrupts the deal and attaches Gargan to the back of the Ferry with webbing. He is then knocked into the bay by a runaway car in the ensuing destruction. In a mid-credits scene, Gargan is physically-scarred with a mechanical brace attached to his right arm (a reference to some version of Scorpion, in which his right arm is designed like a Scorpion's stinger) and meets Adrian Toomes in prison, and says he has comrades on the outside who want to join forces to get revenge on Spider-Man. When Mac mentions the rumor that Toomes knows Spider-Man's identity, Toomes denies it.

He is an old enemy of by Spider-Man, having fought him several times in the past, just like [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. After [[Doctor Octopus]] (Otto Octavius) attacks Ryker's Island and the Raft, all four as well as [[Mister Negative]], are freed and Otto recruits them as the [[Sinister Six]], promising to fulfill each one's desires (with Scorpion's wish being that of expunging his criminal record and erasing his gambling debts). Spider-Man is easily defeated by the Sinister Six's combined forces but not killed because (as it is revealed at the end of the game) Otto is aware of Spider-Man's secret identity. The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Rhino and Scorpion being sent to poison the New York City's reservoir. Spider-Man stops them, but Scorpion injects with his poison, which causes the web-slinger strange hallucinations before eventually being fatal. However, Spider-Man manages to create and inject himself with an antidote just in time. Rhino and Scorpion are later seen at the docks, fighting some of [[Silver Sable|Sable International]]'s mercenaries and trying to destroy the medical deliveres for the people infected with Devil's Breath virus. [[Miles Morales]] encounters the two while there and manages to escape, warning Peter Parker about it. Spider-Man later arrives at the docks and manages to defeat Rhino and Scorpion, trapping them in a container until the police would take them back into custody.
