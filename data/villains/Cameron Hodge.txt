==Fictional character biography==
===X-Factor and The Right===
Cameron Hodge was the college roommate of [[Archangel (comics)|Warren Worthington III]] (also known as the superhuman Angel). Hodge then took a public relations job with a New York advertising firm. After Angel's former [[Defenders (comics)|superhero team]] disbanded, Hodge and Worthington hatched a plan to reunite the original roster of the [[X-Men]]. Under Hodge's plan, the five mutants would pose as professional mutant hunters under the name X-Factor. They would use this cover to contact and teach young mutants.<ref>''X-Factor'' #1-5</ref>

However, the plan backfired, as X-Factor's advertising campaign increased anti-mutant hysteria. In addition, the team suffered a series of major setbacks. After suffering severe injuries during the [[Mutant Massacre]], Angel's wings were amputated, and then seemingly dies in a private jetplane explosion. Tensions arose between X-Factor members [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Marvel Girl when Cyclops saw manifestations of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] around [[Jean Grey]]. X-Factor later discovered that Hodge had orchestrated Angel's amputation and jetplane accident and had created holograms simulating the Phoenix Force.<ref>''X-Factor'' #14-16</ref> Hodge had secretly been Commander of an [[Right (comics)|anti-mutant terrorist group]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=246}}</ref> He had fully intended to exacerbate anti-mutant tensions through his advertising campaign.<ref>''X-Factor'' #17</ref>

During this time, Hodge and The Right made a pact with the extradimensional demonic entity [[N'astirh]]. In exchange for collecting mutant babies, the Right needed for a spell to open up a portal from Limbo to Earth, N'astirh promised Hodge immortality and the continued existence of The Right and its work creating conflict between humans and mutants. Earlier Hodge kidnapped and tortured [[Candace Southern|Candy Southern]] (Warren's former girlfriend). However, his former friend survived the private plane explosion and was transformed into Archangel by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], and invades the Right's headquarters, decapitating Hodge after Hodge kills Candy.<ref>''X-Factor'' #34 (November 1988)</ref>

Hodge's efforts would provide unexpected blows against his enemies; one of his [[Ani-Mator|employees]] kills New Mutant member [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]],<ref>''New Mutants'' #60</ref> and another employee would end up becoming a [[Nanny (comics)|powerful cyberneticist]] who, with the assistance of [[Orphan-Maker]], would plague the X-Men multiple times.<ref>''X-Factor'' #30-35</ref>

===X-Tinction Agenda===
Cameron Hodge was revealed to be alive, his severed head having been attached to a grotesque non-humanoid cyborg, a fate Hodge said he survived as a result of the pact he made with N'astirh.  Hodge took the leading role of the anti-mutant efforts of the [[Genosha]]n government during the "[[The X-Tinction Agenda|X-Tinction Agenda]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline. In the initial attack on the X-Men, members of the [[New Mutants]], plus [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] are kidnapped. [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] dies when Hodge tries and fails to steal the mutant's shape-changing powers, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] is brainwashed into a slave, and [[Rictor]] and [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]] escape into the streets. During the incident, it is revealed that [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] had come to be working for Hodge as a Magistrate. Havok regains his own memory and tries to bring down Hodge from within.<ref>''X-Factor'' #62</ref>

Hodge is confronted by a combined force of X-Men, X-Factor, and New Mutants. Wolfsbane, her mind partly restored, plays a major factor in defeating Hodge, as the mutant transforms Into a giant wolf-form that severely wounds him. The fight soon comes down to Havok, Cyclops and Hodge. The villain ultimately ends up as a head, still immortal, buried as Rictor knocks a building down on top of him.<ref>''X-Factor'' #62 (January 1991)</ref>

===Phalanx===
Cameron Hodge later returns as a member of the cybernetic extraterrestrial [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] race, ironically a form he would have taken if his efforts with Warlock had been successful. Yet again he was apparently slain by Archangel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #306 (November 1993)</ref> Hodge was defeated by [[Steven Lang (comics)|Steven Lang]] when the Phalanx's human interface caused the Phalanx citadel to fall from the top of Mount Everest.<ref>''Cable'' #16</ref>

===Purifiers===
Cameron Hodge's remains are found in the Himalayas by a group of [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]]. He is later revived when [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] infects him with the transmode virus gained from one of Magus' offspring.<ref>''X-Force'' (3rd series) #3</ref> Cameron and his whole army of "Smileys" are killed by Warlock of the New Mutants at the behest of Douglas Ramsey when his lifeforce and the lifeforces of the Smileys are forcibly absorbed by Warlock via their shared connection of the technorganic Transmode virus.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #237</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, Cameron Hodge was the commander of The Right, thus he had access to all the weaponry and resources of the organization, including a ruby quartz battle suit capable of deflecting [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]'s Optic Blasts. The demonic being [[N'astirh]] granted Hodge immortality, that is, he is able to survive a decapitation and still function.

In his cyborg form, he had the ability to phase (move through solid matter) and used various special weapons. His spider/scorpionlike robot body was equipped with tentacles, a powerful stinger, plasma and laser weapons, and a molecular adhesive gun, and could also fire bolas, knives and spears of varying sizes. He also possessed a high degree of invulnerability, enough to protect him from the combined attacks of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Cyclops and [[Jean Grey]]. This effect was supposedly augmented by external generators linked to his mainframe computer. When these had been destroyed, Cyclops and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] could destroy his mechanical body, but not kill him. In addition, in his mechanical body's first appearance, it had a cardboard cutout of a man's suit and body that hung from Hodge's neck, affecting a (to his mind) more normal appearance when his attempt to absorb [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]]'s techno-organic abilities had failed.

As part of the [[Phalanx (comics)#Phalanx on Earth|Phalanx]], he had all their typical abilities, but seemingly lost his magical protection.

Fearing the torture at the hands of Foley and Ford, Hodge convinced Noriko to kill him.<ref>''New X-Men'' #17</ref>
