'''Fu Manchu''' is the name of a fictional supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is based on the [[Fu Manchu|character of the same name]] and is the father of [[Shang-Chi]].

==Publication history==
Fu Manchu first appeared in ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15 (December 1973). He was created by [[Sax Rohmer]] and adapted into [[Marvel Comics]] by [[Steve Englehart]], [[Al Milgrom]], and [[Jim Starlin]]. As the result of Marvel Comics later losing the rights to the Fu Manchu name, his later appearances give him the real name of Zheng Zu.

==Fictional character biography==
Zheng Zu gained his education at the Tibetan monastery of Rach where he learned martial arts, arcane knowledge, and every known discipline of science. Becoming highly regarded in his monastery, Zheng Zu was considered part of their brotherhood until the day he left to share his gifts with the world as Fu Manchu.<ref>''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung Fu]]'' #124.

When his daughter Fah Loo Suee was a child, Fu Manchu showed her the Moon where he told her that he would one day move the world so that he would rule another world.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fu Manchu was revealed to have the knowledge of [[Jack the Ripper]]'s methodology.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #100. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fu Manchu later took the woman Mara Ling to be his wife as part of an arranged marriage despite the fact that she loved a blind archer named Li.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #114. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fu Manchu eventually approached a "scientifically perfect" white American woman to be the mother of his son.  Enticed by his power, she agreed, resulting in the birth of [[Shang-Chi]].<ref name="Special Marvel Edition #15">''Special Marvel Edition'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Tony McKay and Nayland Smith later launched an attack on the Si-Fan where Fu Manchu had killed McKay and used his sumo wrestler servant Tak to torture Smith by crushing his legs. Fu Manchu later introduced schizophrenia to a [[gorilla]] which was used as the final guardian of his New York headquarters.<ref name="Special Marvel Edition #15">''Special Marvel Edition'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> Fu Manchu's African base was struck by the British where many of his followers there were slain. Upon finding a disfigured infant named M'Nai after finding his parents dead, Fu Manchu decided that he can shape M'Nai into a powerful servant and M'Nai was raised alongside Shang-Chi. M'Nai and Shang-Chi became inseparable, even referring to each other as brothers.<ref>''Special Marvel Edition'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Shang-Chi was a boy, he heard from K'uei Meng that Fu Manchu had plans to rule the world. When Shang-Chi confronted his father, Fu Manchu dismissed it as slander and Shang-Chi never saw K'uei Meng again.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Another event in Shang-Chi's childhood is that he saw his father thank a dacoit for saving his life. Years later, the same dacoit was killed by Fu Manchu for failing his mission.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Shang-Chi bested his fellow student Ah Lung in combat, Fu Manchu demanded that Shang-Chi kill him. Due to Shang-Chi hesitating, Fu Manchu had his guards kill Ah Lung.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #158. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Fu Manchu had his pupil Sho Teng seemingly betray Shang-Chi to M16 agents that were secretly on Fu Manchu's side, Fu Manchu "rescued" Shang-Chi and killed their leader Death-Dragon to earn Shang-Chi's trust.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #64. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Shang-Chi was 19, Fu Manchu dispatched Shang-Chi to [[London]] to kill Dr. Petrie who was said to be a threat to peace. Shang-Chi was successful in killing Petrie and was confronted by Nayland Smith who told Shang-Chi the truth about his father. After meeting with his mother in [[New York City|New York]], who confirmed Smith's claims, Shang-Chi fought his way past Fu Manchu's guards at his New York base where he tells his father that they are now enemies.<ref name="Special Marvel Edition #15"/> Fu Manchu later dispatched M'Nai, now calling himself [[Midnight Sun (Marvel Comics)|Midnight]], to kill Shang-Chi only for Midnight to perish upon falling off a crane and his cape snagging onto a hook.<ref>''Special Marvel Edition'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fu Manchu sent his Si-Fan assassin Chow Loo to kill Shang-Chi only to fail in his mission. When he tried to cover it up, Fu Manchu had him transformed into a gorilla-like creature to fight Shang-Chi in Los Angeles where he was killed in battle.<ref>''Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Under the alias of "Wang Yu-Seng", Fu Manchu planned to kidnap Fah Lo Suee and Shang-Chi to jumpstart the Elixir Vitae, which needed the blood of his own children to return him to full vigor. With the help of Death-Dealer, Fu Manchu captured Shang-Chi and held him hostage in order to get his blood only for Shang-Chi to escape. Fu Manchu brought Fah Lo Suee to Honan to have her blood as they are pursued by Shang-Chi. To combat Shang-Chi, Fu Manchu unleashed a clone of Shang-Chi to fight Shang-Chi which ended up bested by Shang-Chi and killed. When Fu Manchu attempted to lap up the clone's blood to save his life, the fortress began to crumble around him as Shang-Chi left his father to meet his doom.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #115–118. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Determined to rid the world of his father's stain, Shang-Chi traveled to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Island to determine what his father's connections with A.I.M. were. His findings were inconclusive.<ref>''Captain America'' #412. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fu Manchu employed [[Zaran]] to retrieve a chemical from A.I.M. and later directed him to kill Shang-Chi for him.<ref>''Marvel Knights'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fu Manchu later sent his dacoits to aid Zaran against Shang-Chi and his allies. Although they succeeded in destroying the building that Shang-Chi was in, Zaran failed to slay him.<ref>''Marvel Knights'' #11–14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Using the alias of Comte de St. Germain and "the Ghost", Fu Manchu employed his son Moving Shadow as he prepared the Hellfire weapon. He was opposed again by MI-6 and Shang-Chi with the resulting battle destroying the Hellfire weapon.<ref>''Masters of Kung Fu'' Vol. 2 #1–6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Under the alias of Han, Fu Manchu offered his daughter Kwai Far to [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] as a prospective bride. Black Panther refused this offer and drove him off with the assistance of [[Luke Cage]] and [[Shang-Chi]].<ref>''Black Panther'' Vol. 4 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Aloysius Thorndrake of the [[Shadow Council]] has somehow partially resurrected Shang-Chi's father, whose real name was revealed to be Zheng Zu (with "Fu Manchu" being one of his many aliases) as the Shadow Council agents are digging for the Eyes of the Dragon. Max Fury (a rogue [[Life Model Decoy]] of [[Nick Fury]]) then reports to Aloysius that they have found the Eyes of the Dragon. Aloysius and Max then move on to the next part of the plan that involves capturing Shang-Chi and using him to restore Zheng Zu to life.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|Prince of Orphans]] and [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] arrive at Zheng Zu's grave where they find a few Shadow Council agents on guard, knowing that someone would come to the grave. They defeat the Shadow Council agents, take one of them prisoner and have him taken to an unknown location. Meanwhile, Max Fury informs Aloysius Thorndrake about the two unfortunate mishaps. Zheng Zu is not pleased, for there is only two days left to complete the ritual needed to restore himself to life. Aloysius promises to Zheng Zu that Max Fury and John Steele will handle this.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Zheng Zu prepares the ritual that will enable him to use Shang-Chi's life-force to resurrect himself. Disguised as a Shadow Council agent, Moon Knight gives the signal and the Secret Avengers drop in on the Shadow Council. Captain Steve Rogers fights Max Fury while Valkyrie fights John Steele. Prince of Orphans disrupts the ritual, causing Zheng Zu to turn to stone which Prince of Orphans shatters.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>
