'''Razor Fist''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. There have actually been 3 characters, all virtually identical in appearance and ability, to go by this title. The original Razor Fist was killed off in the comic books many years ago.  The next two characters to take the title were brothers. The current Razor Fist is the only surviving brother.

==Fictional character biography==
===William Young===
The first Razor-Fist was an assassin, bodyguard, and enforcer employed by Carlton Velcro, working at Velcro's estate on the coast of the Gulf of Lions, southern France. Velcro surgically replaced this man's hands with steel blades. Razor Fist battled [[Shang-Chi]], and was accidentally shot to death by Carlton Velcro's guards.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #29</ref>

[[Doctor Doom]] later constructed two robot duplicates of Razor Fist, which he pitted against Shang-Chi.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' #59-60</ref>

===Douglas Scott===
Called Razor-Fist because of his fast punches, this man and his brother took the same title and pretended to be only one person. Each brother lost one hand in a car accident, which were subsequently replaced by long knife-like stabbing weapons by Carlton Velcro. Velcro employed the brothers at his mansion on an island in the Marquesas. The brothers were assigned by Velcro to hunt down [[Shang-Chi]] and Pavane. This Razor-Fist was accidentally shot to death by Velcro.<ref name="auto">''Master of Kung Fu'' #105</ref>

===William Scott===
When the current Razor-Fist and his brother battled [[Shang-Chi]], this one was defeated and captured by Shang-Chi and Pavane.<ref name="auto"/> Sometime after the first brother was killed the other brother (the current Razor Fist) lost his other hand.
