'''Bullseye''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A psychopathic assassin, Bullseye uses the opportunities afforded by his line of work to exercise his homicidal tendencies and to work out his own personal vendetta against [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. He is also an enemy of the [[Punisher]]. Although he possesses no [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], Bullseye is able to use almost any object as a lethal projectile, be it weapons like [[shuriken]] and [[Sai (weapon)|sai]] or seemingly harmless objects like playing cards and pencils. His [[marksmanship]] is uncanny, at a nearly supernatural level.

Bullseye was 20th in [[IGN]]'s list of the "Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/20.html |title=Bullseye is Number 20 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203091526/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/20.html |archivedate=2011-02-03 |df= }}</ref> and 35th in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers".<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/35 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> The character has been adapted into various forms of media relating to Daredevil.

==Publication history==
The character's first appearance is in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' <!-- only denote volume number after first --> #131 (March 1976). Although created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]], the book features art by [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]]<ref>Wolfman, in an undated [http://www.ugo.com/channels/freestyle/features/teentitans/ "Comics Channel" interview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718204253/http://www.ugo.com/channels/freestyle/features/teentitans/ |date=July 18, 2006 }} in ''Underground Online'', recalled: "Bob Brown is the artist that drew the book, but he didn't co-create him. I had come up with the character, designed a rough version of the costume and then sat down with John Romita Sr. to do the final version.</ref> and [[Klaus Janson]].
<!-- Lester or is his name Leonard? The Superherobox says Lester, but the bio says Leonard. -->
<!-- We don't know.  Lester is likely wrong, as at the end of Bullseye: Greatest Hits, he confesses that it's actually his brother's name. -->
<!--I amended the info box to reflect this last comment.  The article explains it pretty well. -->
<!--But his father calls him Lester in Dark Reign Hawkeye#4 -->

Bullseye's real name and origins are unknown. He has used the name "Benjamin Poindexter" on several occasions, but there are also instances where his name is given as “Lester". The miniseries ''Bullseye: Greatest Hits'' (2004) developed the character's [[backstory]], but also revealed that some or all of it has been fabricated, probably by Bullseye himself. In this series, Bullseye's name was Leonard.

Following [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], [[Warren Ellis]] took over writing ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' and Bullseye became one of the core members of the new team line-up.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92433 Better Know a Thunderbolt: Bullseye] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126163051/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92433 |date=2007-01-26 }}, [[Newsarama]], November 28, 2006</ref>

In the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' aftermath storyline ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'', Bullseye becomes a member of the [[Dark Avengers]] under the alias [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19654 THE OSBORN SUPREMACY: Dark Avengers], [[Comic Book Resources]], January 22, 2008</ref> and features in a five-issue limited series ''Dark Reign: Hawkeye'', written by [[Andy Diggle]], with art by [[Tom Raney]].<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/030902-HAwkeye-Diggle.html What's in a Name? Andy Diggle on Dark Reign: Hawkeye], [[Newsarama]], March 2, 2009</ref> As a member of the Dark Avengers, he has a major role in the crossover ''[[Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men]]: Utopia'', written by [[Matt Fraction]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21217 IRON PATRIOTISM: Bullseye], [[Comic Book Resources]], May 15, 2009</ref> He appeared as a regular character in ''Dark Avengers'' #1-16 (March 2009-June 2010).

Bullseye is killed by Daredevil in ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' #1, but is later confirmed alive in ''Daredevil'' Vol. 3 #26.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life and back-story===
Bullseye grew up in [[The Bronx]], where he lived with his brother and their abusive father. His brother's main form of recreation was playing with [[rifle]]s, leading him to become an expert shot. When he was 10 years old, his brother started a fire in their home in an unsuccessful attempt to kill their father. Shortly thereafter, Bullseye was placed in a foster home, and became a [[baseball]] player in [[high school]]. He was an extremely talented pitcher, and was offered a [[scholarship]], but instead opted to enter the minor leagues. After three games, he was called up to play a sold-out Major League game. He had surrendered no hits the entire game, and in the bottom of the ninth with two outs, he became bored and requested the coach pull him from the game. The coach refused, and insisted that he finish the game. The opposing team's batter mocked him, accusing him of cowardice. Bullseye threw the ball at his head, killing him. As the ball struck, he said only one word: "Bullseye". He was barred from professional baseball and convicted of [[manslaughter]].

This is a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] of a previous origin story, which depicts Bullseye growing up as a below average student in a trailer park with an alcoholic, physically abusive [[Kingmaker (comics)|father]]. In this version of events, Bullseye fakes his father's suicide using a handgun set off by a toy arrow. None or all elements of this version may be true since it describes his father as possibly recovering from a recent divorce, fitting in perfectly with Daredevil's taunts in their confrontation during the "Hardcore" storyline.<ref>''Elektra'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

His cold demeanor and unique skills, however, meant subsequent recruitment by the [[National Security Agency]] as an assassin was inevitable, and he was soon assigned to train [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]]. By the time he arrived, however, he claimed to have already been planning to leave the NSA. He had planned on robbing the Contras blind and fleeing, but soon discovered they were desperately poor. Bullseye made the best of the situation: within seven hours of being informed of their poverty, he had led the Contras in seizing a landing strip that the [[Colombia]]n [[cocaine]] smugglers were using as a staging area before moving on to the [[United States]]. Without use of the airfield, the smugglers were unable to send new shipments. Bullseye set up his hapless Nicaraguan translator Paolo as the leader of the new force controlling the airfield, and let the word spread around, however, Paolo was nothing but a [[wikt:patsy|patsy]]. Bullseye planned to invite several [[organized crime]] heads to the airfield to broker a new deal with him as Paolo's supposed "right hand man". He would take their money and disappear, presumably leaving Paolo to suffer the wrath of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]], [[Russian Mafia]], [[Yakuza]], and various other criminal elements. However, before the deal could be finalized, the [[Punisher]] (Frank Castle) arrived.

Castle killed all the organized crime leaders in a fiery explosion from which Bullseye barely escaped. The two engaged in a fierce battle in which Bullseye was able to wound the Punisher and evade or disable several of his weapons. Bullseye then used some blood-reddened mud to paint a bull's-eye on his forehead, mocking Castle's inability to hit him. The fight concluded when [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] agents arrived, and the Punisher fled. Bullseye turned himself in to the D.E.A. agents and soon was assigned to infiltrate the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s criminal empire. He obtained a costume, fled yet again, and became one of the most dangerous [[Hitman|hitmen]] in the world.

All of the above information is given by Bullseye during a subsequent interrogation by US intelligence. Just prior to escaping from custody, Bullseye confesses he made up some or all of his story to amuse himself; for example, he claims that he was really the one who started the fire which burned down his childhood home. The whole capture was a plan by the assassin to gain access to the prison where his father is being held. Bullseye finally gets revenge on his father, leaving him to burn as the prison's security systems torch everything inside.

===Costumed criminal career===
Bullseye battles (and defeats) [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] at a circus in order to establish his reputation as an [[extortionist]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #131-132. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shortly after, Daredevil by chance overhears him in the midst of an extortion attempt and captures him.<ref>''Daredevil'' #132. Marvel Comics.</ref> Bullseye is later hired by Maxwell Glenn to kill Matt Murdock and [[Foggy Nelson]], and Daredevil interferes. Although Bullseye wins again, Daredevil escapes death,<ref>''Daredevil'' #141-142. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Bullseye's professional reputation is damaged as a result. Seeking to regain his credibility, he challenges Daredevil on live television, but is soundly defeated.<ref>''Daredevil'' #146. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Smarting from this even harsher blow to his reputation, Bullseye hires Eric Slaughter's gang and kidnaps the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] (Natasha Romanoff) to bait Daredevil into a revenge bout.<ref>''Daredevil'' #159-160. Marvel Comics.</ref> Daredevil defeats him again, and the despair of this repeated humiliation drives him to a mental breakdown.<ref>''Daredevil'' #161</ref> It is later revealed that this breakdown was in part caused by a [[brain tumor]], which begins causing [[migraine]]s, [[paranoia]] and [[hallucination]]s that everyone he meets is Daredevil.<ref name="DD169">''Daredevil'' #169. Marvel Comics.</ref> He escapes from prison, but is recaptured by Daredevil, and the tumor is successfully removed.<ref name="DD169"/> The tumor's symptoms quickly disappear, and defense lawyers are able to have him freed on the argument that his criminal behavior was caused solely by the brain tumor. He is hired to assassinate the Kingpin, but meets with repeated failure.<ref>''Daredevil'' #170-172. Marvel Comics.</ref> Inexplicably, this convinces the Kingpin to employ him as a chief assassin, but he is fired the same day he witnesses the Kingpin's humiliating defeat at Daredevil's hands.<ref>''Daredevil'' #172. Marvel Comics.</ref> Bullseye's repeated failed attempts to regain this briefly-held position became a [[running joke]] of the ''Daredevil'' series.

While in prison, he learns that the Kingpin has employed [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] (Daredevil's former lover) as a new chief assassin. After escaping prison, Bullseye attacks and impales Elektra on her own [[Sai (weapon)|sai]]. This fails to convince the Kingpin, says he'll only be rehired if he kills Daredevil.<ref name="Daredevil #181">''Daredevil'' #181. Marvel Comics.</ref> Bullseye attempts to ambush Daredevil, but their battle ends with his arch-foe dropping him from atop a telephone wire. The multi-story fall breaks Bullseye's back, [[paralysis|paralyzing]] him.<ref name="Daredevil #181"/>

During Bullseye's extended hospital stay following the fall, Daredevil breaks into his hospital room and forces him to participate in a two-man variation on [[Russian roulette]]. The revolver used in the game is secretly unloaded, but Daredevil has Bullseye take the even-numbered turns so that he would feel sure that the last shot is going to kill him.<ref>''Daredevil'' #191. Marvel Comics.</ref> Bullseye has repeatedly cited this incident as his greatest grudge against Daredevil.<ref name="DD200">''Daredevil'' #200</ref><ref name="Thunderbolts #110">''Thunderbolts'' #110. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Japanese scientist [[Lord Dark Wind]] liberates Bullseye and has him brought to Japan, lacing his bones with [[adamantium]] and thus restoring his mobility. Lord Dark Wind did this so that Bullseye would work as an assassin in return, but in spite of this favor being done for him, Bullseye refuses to work for free.<ref>''Daredevil'' #196-199. Marvel Comics.</ref> He instead makes another play to regain the position of the Kingpin's chief assassin once again if he kills Daredevil, knowing he would fail.<ref name="DD200"/> Bullseye is imprisoned for several years.

Bullseye eventually escapes prison,<ref>''Captain America'' #372. Marvel Comics.</ref> and then battles [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #373-374. Marvel Comics.</ref> He battles [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] in an attempt to assassinate the [[Red Skull]] to regain his old position with the Kingpin.<ref>''Captain America'' #377. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After encountering the amnesiac Daredevil,<ref>''Daredevil'' #284. Marvel Comics.</ref> he takes advantage of this by impersonating '''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]''' and committing robberies in an attempt to destroy his nemesis's image.<ref>''Daredevil'' #285-289. Marvel Comics.</ref> In one of his early heists, he is caught by his mark's disillusioned [[trophy wife]]. He becomes enamored of the wife who pleads with him to be taken away by him, but he keeps the wife in his derelict hideout as his lover, attempting to flatter by showering with stolen money and jewelry. However, the woman comes to realize that he is mentally weak and, frightened by one of his psychotic outbursts, leaves him.<ref>''Daredevil'' #285-287. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gradually, Bullseye becomes so immersed in his Daredevil impersonation that he believes himself to truly be Daredevil, a confusion which the real hero takes advantage of in order to defeat him.<ref>''Daredevil'' #290. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bullseye later has another run-in with the Punisher when he is part of Frank's frame-up scheme that ends with Bullseye getting both of his hands shot and losing a finger to the Punisher's brutality. Bullseye encounters [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]<ref>''Deadpool'' (3rd Series) #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]<ref>''Gambit'' Vol. 3 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> during another long interval in which the character was seldom used.

Bullseye is hired by the villain [[Mysterio]] to attack and confuse Daredevil. In the course of their battle, Bullseye kills [[Karen Page]] (Daredevil's longtime love interest) with one of Daredevil's own billy clubs.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bullseye is recruited to steal the ''[[Identity Disc]]'', purported to be in possession of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and have vital information on the world's superheroes, along with Deadpool, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>''Identity Disc'' #1-5 (Aug-Dec 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bullseye offers to kill Daredevil for Kingpin, later entering Daredevil's apartment and attempting to kill [[Milla Donovan]] (Daredevil's new girlfriend). Enraged and already near the breaking point, Daredevil attacks Bullseye and throws him out the window. During the fight, the hero reveals to Bullseye that he knows his real name Lester, his mother was a [[prostitution|prostitute]], and that he never knew his father.<ref>''Daredevil/Bullseye: The Target'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He mocks the assassin's new 'Bullseye' tattoo and carves a new one over it with a rock.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol. 2 #49. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bullseye seeks purported documents confirming Daredevil's [[secret identity]]. After a brutal fight with Daredevil and Elektra, Bullseye flees into open traffic where he is hit by a truck, sustaining severe injuries.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol. 2 #76-81 (2005-2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Thunderbolts===
{{Main|Thunderbolts (comics)|Secret Invasion}}
Bullseye, along with many other villains, is recruited into the Thunderbolts by [[Iron Man]] and [[Mister Fantastic]] to hunt down anti-registration superheroes in the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline.<ref>''Civil War'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterwards, he is recruited by [[Norman Osborn]] into the reformed team led by [[Karla Sofen|Moonstone]]. He operates invisibly and is not seen by the public. He is used as a last resort and has a nano-chain fed into his system, so if he disobeys orders, he will receive an electrical shock.<ref name="Thunderbolts #110"/>

Bullseye fights [[American Eagle (Marvel Comics)|American Eagle]] after having been deceived by [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] and told that his nano-chain is disabled. During the fight, he simultaneously receives an electrical shock from the nano-chain in his system on order of Moonstone and is attacked by American Eagle. American Eagle beats him severely, mocking him throughout for purposely avoiding fights with superpowered foes, and finally breaks Bullseye's neck. As a result of the damage sustained from both being attacked by a man with superhuman strength and being shocked by the nano-chain, Bullseye is paralyzed, is unable to speak, and has incurred severe brain injuries.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #115</ref> Bullseye is later shown walking due to nanomechanical surgery, then goes on a killing spree using scalpels to "get some target practice in".<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he joins the Thunderbolts in their efforts to assassinate [[Moon Knight]].<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 4 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bullseye was with the Thunderbolts when they fought the [[Skrull]]s in Washington DC.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #123. Marvel Comics.</ref> He took advantage of the clone of [[Fenris (comics)|Andrea von Strucker]] being distracted by Moonstone to kill Andrea, and nearly killed Moonstone in the process.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #124. Marvel Comics.</ref> Bullseye travels along with the other Thunderbolts to Central Park and joins the final battle against the main Skrull force. Obtaining a missile launcher from the Zeus, he fires a rocket through the Skrull [[Criti Noll|Yellowjacket]]'s right eye, thus disabling the Skrull from engaging with other heroes.<ref>''Thunderbolts #125''. Marvel Comics.</ref> Osborn orders Bullseye to kill Songbird, finally giving Bullseye the chance for revenge.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #126. Marvel Comics.</ref> Bullseye nearly succeeds, but is incapacitated by the [[Fenris (comics)|Swordsman]] helping Songbird escape.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #127. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Dark Avengers===
{{Main|Dark Reign (comics)}}
As a reward for his role during the Skrull invasion, Bullseye is placed on the [[Dark Avengers]] and given the costume and codename of '''[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]'''.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Osborn hires Bullseye to eliminate Deadpool, from whom Norman stole data about "how to kill a Skrull queen" but Bullseye is unsuccessful.<ref>''Deadpool'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

On the Dark Avengers' first mission, he kills [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgana le Fey]] only for the woman to return yet again with an army of demons.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #3</ref>

When the Dark Avengers fight a rogue [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] robot, "Hawkeye" disables the robot after killing its pilot. When the robot falls and killing thirty-six civilians, Osborn reprimands Bullseye for his part in the deaths, to which Bullseye demands credit for his kills. "Hawkeye" then goes out and saves a woman from being attacked by three men. He kills the men, and the woman inadvertently infuriates him by referring to Osborn as "his boss". After he kills the woman, he notices a news crew in a helicopter filming the action.<ref>''Dark Reign: Hawkeye'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He silences the news crew by blowing the helicopter up.<ref>''Dark Reign: Hawkeye'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bullseye is used to take out his old partner Deadpool. Deadpool eventually gains the upper hand and stabs Bullseye through the chest with a meathook, who later wakes up in a hospital and goes after Deadpool again. Deadpool easily avoids Bullseye's attacks, then runs Bullseye down, stopping with one of the vehicle's tires on Bullseye's leg. Bullseye pays off Deadpool (under the pretense that Osborn told him to do so) to save himself.<ref>''Deadpool'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Elektra stabs Bullseye with his own arrow.<ref name="dre4">''Dark Reign: Elektra'' #4 (June 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bullseye is later given the order by Osborn to eliminate Daredevil who has been discovered leading the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''Dark Reign: The List - Daredevil''. Marvel Comics.</ref> Daredevil (who is going through the trials needed to join the Hand) and Bullseye clash. Bullseye booby-traps a building with one hundred people in it.

Osborn later assigns Bullseye with the duty to kill Lindy Reynolds (Sentry's wife).<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> He takes Lindy for a helicopter ride, and strangles and dumps Lindy's body in the ocean. When the Sentry questions him about Lindy's whereabouts, Bullseye claims Lindy committed suicide over the countryside by jumping out of the copter, and the Sentry flies off to find Lindy.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Shadowland===
In the aftermath of [[Siege (comics)|Siege]], Bullseye is incarcerated and sent to the Raft. But in the process of being transferred there, he manages to kill his captors and escapes. He makes his way back to Hell's Kitchen and arrives at Shadowland, Daredevil's fortress, and is confronted by Daredevil and a legion of Hand ninjas. Bullseye is unprepared for his enemy's newfound ruthlessness as Daredevil dislocates both his shoulders and then stabs him through the heart with his own sai, in much the same way Bullseye had killed Elektra years before.<ref>''Shadowland'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, a group of Hells Bikers put together an unauthorized funeral service (as [[J. Jonah Jameson]] had expressly forbade) for Bullseye; [[Ben Urich]] is dragged along, as well as Danny Deaver. However, Deaver continually sees visions of Bullseye; it is not clear whether or not it is Bullseye's spirit or simply part of Deaver's psychosis. Bullseye's funeral service is interrupted by Daredevil and the Hand and a massive brawl breaks out, almost killing Urich.<ref>''Shadowland: Bullseye'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Daredevil later exhumes Bullseye's corpse, intending to resurrect him as a soldier loyal to the Hand.<ref>''Shadowland'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> The heroes interrupt the ceremony, preventing Bullseye's resurrection.<ref>''Shadowland'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Return===
It was later revealed that Bullseye was still barely alive as his body disappeared after the battle, but he has become an invalid due to his injuries who has to rely on a metal lung in order to survive. To get revenge, he is revealed to be the mastermind behind Klaw, Coyote, and Ikari's actions against Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol. 3 #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is later found by the hero who defeated Ikari and Lady Bullseye. The warehouse where they were is subsequently destroyed, and Bullseye is nearly drowned in radioactive waste, leaving him scarred and blind.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol. 3 #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, Bullseye is among the villains attending the Kingpin's viewing party of the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Infinity Wars]]" storyline, Bullseye is among the villains that accompany [[Turk Barrett]] to his meeting with the [[Infinity Watch]] at Central Park.<ref>''Infinity Wars'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Bullseye has an innate ability to throw virtually any object as a projectile with incredible accuracy and with enough force to be lethal. Some of his accomplishments include lacerating a person’s throat with a thrown playing card, spitting his own tooth through a human skull, tossing a paper airplane to a distant rooftop, and killing a person with a toothpick thrown through a window from a hundred yards away.<ref>''Daredevil: The Target'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Aside from his ability to throw projectiles with lethal accuracy, Bullseye is also an expert martial artist and is extremely talented in the use of edged/throwing weapons and conventional firearms. Bullseye has exceptional physical conditioning, with the agility, reflexes, stamina, and speed of a professional athlete.

Due to injuries from a multi-story fall, many of Bullseye's bones have been reinforced with strips of adamantium.<ref name="DD197">''Daredevil'' Vol. 1 #197. Marvel Comics.</ref> This has increased his resistance to injury in unarmed combat. This reinforcement also allows Bullseye to utilize acrobatic maneuvers impossible for an ordinary human, as his bones are protected from fracture. While [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s adamantium was implanted using only stolen, incomplete notes on the bonding process as a guideline,<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref> and thus only his [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] healing factor allowed him to survive the process, Bullseye's surgery was performed properly by [[Lord Dark Wind]] himself, and thus included the special herb treatment which prevents the body from being destroyed by the implantation.<ref name="DD197"/>

Bullseye has a compulsive need to study his targets' histories, abilities, and relationships before engaging them. He employs this information to attempt to anticipate his opponents' movements in combat. This compulsion often crosses from the professional into the personal, such as Bullseye's obsession with Elektra. Due to a mutual head injury, Bullseye was able to sense Daredevil's presence psychically for a brief time.<ref>''Daredevil'' #197-199. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
{{Main|Age of Apocalypse}}
In the 1994 arc of a different timeline, Bullseye is seen as one of the humans' greatest soldiers. Using a machine gun and hitting every enemy target, he fights on the side of "good". He does not wear his original costume, and does not act insane.<ref>''X-Universe'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Mutant X===
A version of Bullseye appears in the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' continuity, also a notorious supervillain. Bullseye shows up at the courthouse to assassinate [[Alternative versions of Beast#Mutant X|The Brute]] when The Brute is on trial for murder charges. He is beaten by Elektra.<ref>''Mutant X'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===PunisherMAX===
{{Main|PunisherMAX}}
A version of Bullseye appears in [[Jason Aaron]]'s run on ''PunisherMax'' starting with issue #6. This version of Bullseye is hired by the Kingpin to kill the Punisher. He does not wear a costume but has a bullseye tattooed on his forehead. Although his abilities are more realistic than in the mainstream Marvel continuity, he is still a very talented marksman and a deadly fighter, proficient with a variety of weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22088 |title=Jason Aaron Takes Punisher to the MAX |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> His real name is '''Shelton Pendergrass'''.<ref>''Punisher: Max'' #7</ref>

This version is [[psychopathic]]/[[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] and extreme [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive]] toward his targets. He is said to have gassed an entire elementary school when some children were witness to a mob hit and then killed the rest of the town with bombs at the mass funeral. Obsessing with getting inside the Punisher's head, Bullseye kills the father of a suburban family and takes the wife and children hostage, putting himself in the role of their new husband and father. He then arranges for gunmen to kill the family in front of him to recreate The Punisher's origin. He fails to feel why The Punisher was upset by this occurrence.<ref>''Punisher: Max'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> Off-panel Bullseye repeats the same experiment with three more families.<ref>''Punisher: Max'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Eventually Bullseye realizes what the last thing the Punisher said to his wife was. This realization sends the Punisher into shock and sends a near-death Bullseye into a smiling coma.<ref name="PunisherMax #18">''Punisher: Max'' #18.

Dex grew up playing little league baseball, focusing his aim until he could hit the same spot on a brick wall repeatedly, carving a hole in the ball's shape. When his coach benched him to allow his teammates field time, Dex rebounded the ball off a post and into the back of his coach's head, killing his coach. His therapist diagnosed him with [[borderline personality disorder]] with possible psychopathic tendencies. Dex listens to his childhood therapy sessions tapes whenever he needs to calm down, searching for a "north star" (someone to guide him on how to act in society).<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Perfect Game|series=Marvel's Daredevil|credits=Holmes, Julian (director); Tonya Kong (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=October 19, 2018|season=3|number=5}}</ref>  He is manipulated by Fisk into carrying out assassinations after Fisk replaces Julie Barnes (a woman who Dex had been stalking for guidance) as Dex's "north star".<ref>{{cite episode|title=Upstairs/Downstairs|series=Marvel's Daredevil|credits=Zakrzewski, Alex (director); Dara Resnik (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=October 19, 2018|season=3|number=8}}</ref> Instead of using the Bullseye costume or moniker, Dex spends much of his time in a copy of the Daredevil costume, using his trademark ability to throw things with deadly accuracy to impugn Daredevil's name under Fisk's command.

===Film===
[[Colin Farrell]] portrayed Bullseye in the 2003 ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'' film adaptation. This version has an Irish background, and his traditional costume was dropped in favor of a [[motorcycle|biker]]/[[Heavy metal subculture|metalhead]] style appearance: a reptile-skin [[duster (clothing)|duster]] ([[trench coat]]), leather pants, black tank top, dark goatee, tattoos, multiple earrings, and a shaved head with a bull's-eye branding on his forehead (although he does jokingly request a costume from the Kingpin). Prior to the film's release, the comic book version adopted a near-identical appearance but has since reverted to the traditional look, retaining only the scar. Director [[Mark Steven Johnson]] credited [[Joe Quesada]] for talking him out of using the traditional costume.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rob Worley |date=August 7, 2002 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=14178 |title=''Daredevil'' |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> In the movie, Bullseye uses [[shuriken]]s carried in his belt buckle as his main weapon, although he uses many small objects, including peanuts, paperclips, playing cards, shards of broken glass, and a pencil with as much ease. He is hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to kill Nikolas Natchios. Bullseye fights with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and kills Natchios with Daredevil's billy club, causing [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]] to believe Daredevil is the killer. Bullseye perceives Daredevil as a personal challenge, because Daredevil is the only target he has ever missed. Elektra later seeks revenge on Daredevil but soon realizes Bullseye is Natchios's killer. Elektra and Bullseye battle, and he brutally kills Elektra. Daredevil chases Bullseye to a church, and they battle until Daredevil maneuvers Bullseye's hands to be shot by an ESU sniper, leaving him with wounds resembling [[stigmata]]. Daredevil grabs and throws him out of a window, crashing onto the hood of [[Ben Urich]]'s car. A final scene shows him hospitalized but still able to flick a hypodermic needle with enough force and accuracy to impale a fly without killing it. Colin Farrell was attached to the role in December 2001.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Swanson |date=December 5, 2001 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117856845.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Farrell targets ''Daredevil'' |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> Farrell, adopting an American accent for most of his previous films, was encouraged to keep his Irish accent.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ryan J.

But it's not exactly a character you can do [[method acting]] for... you know, running around New York killing people with paper clips."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmTv/features/minorityreport/colin.asp |title=Colin Farrell Interview |publisher=[[UGO Networks|UGO]] |accessdate=2008-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216102800/http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/minorityreport/colin.asp |archivedate=2008-02-16 |df= }}</ref></blockquote>
