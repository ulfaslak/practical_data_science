==Fictional character biography==
'''David Cannon''' was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. After discovering his [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers to move at great speeds at an early age, he turns to a life of crime. This eventually brings Cannon, using his first alias as the '''Human Top''' and pursuing his career as a jewel thief, into conflict with Giant-Man and the Wasp on several occasions.<ref>''Tales To Astonish'' #50 - 52 + 55</ref> Defeated each time, Cannon then redesigns his costume and adopts the alias of "Whirlwind", and adopts the identity of '''Charles Matthews''', chauffeur of [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]].<ref>''Avengers'' #46</ref> Whirlwind joined the supervillain group the second [[Masters of Evil]], and participated in a plot to destroy the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #54</ref> He joined the third Masters of Evil, and participated in a Vermont battle against the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #83</ref> With [[Batroc the Leaper]] and [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], he went on a mission for the [[Red Skull]].<ref>''Captain America'' #130</ref>

Cannon continues with the Charles Matthews identity,<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #6 Nov. 1972</ref> first with the intent of robbing van Dyne, later with the intent of [[flirting|hitting on]] van Dyne. In the role of Charles, he pines for Janet, making advances when [[Hank Pym]] is presumed to be dead during the run in ''[[Marvel Feature]]''.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #5-6 Sept-Nov 1972</ref> Charles is later fired for trying to embezzle Janet's money,<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #9 May 1973</ref> and Hank finally discovers that Charles is Whirlwind later on in the series, forcing Whirlwind to abandon the identity.<ref>''Avengers'' vol.1, #139 Sept. 1975</ref>

Whirlwind is then employed by master villain [[Count Nefaria]] and joined the [[Lethal Legion]]. Nefaria temporarily amplifies the abilities of Whirlwind and super-powered team-mates [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] and the [[Living Laser]] before sending them against the Avengers. The effect, however, is temporary and their combined abilities are drained by Nefaria subsequently defeated by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #164 - 166</ref> Whirlwind joined the third Masters of Evil in a plan to destroy the Avengers, but caused their defeat by attacking prematurely.<ref>''Avengers'' #222</ref> Whirlwind later upgrades his costume when joining a new version of the Masters of Evil formed by [[Baron Zemo]].<ref>''Avengers'' #270 - 277</ref> Whirlwind partnered with the [[Trapster]], obtained a new battle armor and weapons from the [[Tinkerer]], and battled [[Captain America]] in an attempt to bolster his criminal reputation.<ref>''Captain America'' #324</ref> He then partnered with the [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], traveled to San Francisco to steal an experimental "psycho-circuit", and battled the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #16</ref> Whirlwind also shows signs of an obsession with the Wasp, as he forces prostitutes to dress in the Wasp's past costumes and then assaults them.<ref>''Avengers'' vol.3, #71</ref>

Whirlwind and the Trapster end up fighting, due to a bounty placed on the former by the up-and-coming criminal mastermind Ricadonna. Trapster glues Whirlwind to the floor just at the start of his spin. He continues twirling, breaking many of his bones, including his spine.<ref>''[[Daughters of the Dragon]]'' #3 (2006)</ref> He makes a full recovery and is forced to join Baron Zemo's team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #104</ref> After leaving them, he gathered a group of villains together and tried to extort money from the Thunderbolts' new director [[Norman Osborn]], but was viciously beaten by Osborn and is now forced to work secretly.<ref>''Thunderbolts: Reason in Madness''</ref> In ''Dark Reign: Zodiac'', Cannon is shown as a mole for Zodiac, working as Norman's chauffeur.<ref>''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: Zodiac''</ref>

Whirlwind later attacks Hank blaming for Janet's death during the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' and outraged by Pym taking the Wasp codename. He is defeated by the [[Avengers Academy]] student [[Striker (comics)|Striker]]. In a conversation between Striker and his mother, it is revealed that she hired Whirlwind to stage the attack to gain publicity for Striker.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #5</ref>

Whirlwind was recruited by the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] and [[Zeke Stane]] into joining the other villains in a plot to take down [[Iron Man]]. Whirlwind receives a new costume from Mandarin and Zeke Stane.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #513</ref>

During the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Whirlwind was seen with [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]] robbing banks when they are approached by [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]]. Spymaster enlists Whirlwind and Blizzard to help him and the villains he recruited to attack the almost-defenseless Stark Tower.<ref>''Infinity: Heist'' #1</ref>

Whirlwind was hired by [[Power Broker]]'s "Hench" App to kill Ant-Man as part of the App's demonstration to [[Darren Cross]]. When Cross was unwilling to give Power Broker the 1.2 billion dollars he demanded for investment in the Hench app, this caused Power Broker to cancel the demo and cancel Whirlwind's assassination on Ant-Man.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Whirlwind was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. Using Kobik, S.H.I.E.L.D. transformed Whirlwind into a teenager named Scotty. When Baron Zemo and Fixer restored everyone's memories, Whirlwind went on a rampage with Absorbing Man. When the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] and [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] show up to retrieve Absorbing Man, Whirlwind joins Absorbing Man in siding with Hood's [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]].<ref>''Illuminati'' #6</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Whirlwind is among the villains that joins the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #13</ref> Whirlwind, Batroc the Leaper, and Living Laser attack a haggard, bearded man in torn World War II army uniform who identifies himself as Steve Rogers. He is assisted by people that appear to be Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes with both his arms.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Whirlwind is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses the ability to rotate his body around its lengthwise axis at great speeds, without impairing his ability to see, speak, or interact with his environment (for instance, pick up objects or change clothes). Although he can rotate at subsonic speeds he can only travel in a straight line for a limited time, or fly like a helicopter for an even shorter length of time. He possesses superhuman agility, reflexes, coordination, and balance, and often uses himself as a human battering ram. Whirlwind has the ability to focus air currents generated by his rotation into a jet stream powerful enough to blast a hole through a brick wall, as well as create a windscreen able to deflect matter as massive as a falling boulder. He also has the ability to create small tornadoes.

Whirlwind wears full body armor. Since upgrading his armor, Whirlwind has added to his offensive capabilities via the use of two {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} hardened tool-steel sawblades mounted on metal wrist bracelets, which are driven by two DC servo-motors each and activated by palm switches. He also uses thrown [[shuriken]] and razor sharp jacks, whose damaging potential is greatly increased by the velocity of his whirling powers.

==Other versions==
===Heroes Reborn===
In the ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'' reality, Whirlwind is featured as well. This version wears a streamlined suit of armor with multiple blades.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Masters of Evil'' (2000)</ref> He was hired by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] to attack Tony Stark. To this end, Whirlwind kidnapped Stark's secretary [[Pepper Potts]] and blackmailed Stark to come to the Stark International office on Long Island alone without his "bodyguard" Iron Man (unaware that Stark himself was in reality Iron Man). Going to the office without his Iron Man armor, Tony was more than ready to deal with Whirlwind without his armor. Using various gadgets to defend himself and Pepper, Stark had Whirlwind chase him down to a Stark International Lab. There Tony activated a Kinetic Intake Converter that threatened to destroy Whirlwind if he didn't surrender. Refusing to do so, Whirlwind was engulfed with the converter's energy and killed.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 2 #3</ref>

===JLA/Avengers===
Whirlwind is among the enthralled villains guarding [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold. He tries to attack Thor from behind as Thor helps [[Red Tornado]] but is shot by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #3</ref>

===Old Man Logan===
In the pages of ''[[Old Man Logan]]'', the elderly Logan awoke on Earth-616 and had a flashback to where Whirlwind, [[Red Skull]], [[Baron Blood]], [[Count Nefaria]], and [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] were standing over the dead bodies of the superheroes the day when the villains rose and the heroes fell.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>
