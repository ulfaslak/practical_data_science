'''Fenris''' ('''Andrea von Strucker''' and '''Andreas von Strucker''') are two [[fiction]]al characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. They are the [[Germans|German]] [[twin]] children of supervillain [[Baron Strucker]] of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] and the half-siblings of [[Werner von Strucker]]. 

Andrea von Strucker and Andreas von Strucker appear in the television series ''[[The Gifted (U.S. TV series)|The Gifted]]'', portrayed by Caitlin Mehner and Paul Cooper respectively.

==Publication history==
Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Romita Jr.]], the von Strucker twins first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #194 (June 1985) in their civilian identity and in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #200 (December 1985) as Fenris.

==Fictional character biography==
Andrea and Andreas are the children of the terrorist organization [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] leader [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]]. While the two were still in their mother's uterus, they were genetically modified which gave them bio-energy powers which they can use when in physical contact with one another (usually when holding hands). Strucker indoctrinated his children in the beliefs of [[white supremacy]], Nazism and the [[Fourth Reich]]. In adulthood, the twins became the [[supervillain]]s known as "Fenris" and led the Fenris terrorist organization.

Like their father, they are white supremacists. The Strucker twins have gone up against [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] when Storm interrupts Andreas' attempted assault on a native woman in Africa. Andrea retaliates for Storm's humiliation of her brother by shooting her in the head and leaving her to die.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #196</ref> The Strucker twins despise [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] for the role in their father's seeming death some years after World War II. They conduct acts of terrorism and finally attack Magneto during the trial in Paris by the International Court of Justice for crimes against humanity.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #200</ref> The [[X-Men]] foil their assassination attempt, but Fenris manages to escape by allowing themselves to be swept into the old city sewers. The twins later resurface as part of a [[Upstarts (comics)|group of mutant millionaires]] who engage in a campaign of murder as part of a game organized by the mutant telepath [[Gamesmaster (comics)|Gamesmaster]] and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s former Black Queen [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]. The twins tried to acquire [[Omega Red]] for the Upstarts but failed. The twins ultimately met their match, though, when they tried to kill the former [[New Mutants|New Mutant]] [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]. Wolfsbane and the [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team easily beat the twins.

The twins joined a conference of powerful criminal leaders who intended to divide up what's left by the fallen [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s empire. Among the members of the conference were [[Slug (comics)|Slug]], [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and [[Werner von Strucker]]. The twins did not believe Werner was actually their sibling. This, and other arguments, caused the conference to degenerate into a shouting, shooting and blasting match. Fenris attempted to kill Hammerhead but was rescued. Their sibling is soon after killed by their father attending the conference disguised as Werner's assistant. The twins resurfaced, where they were seen working with Baron Strucker.<ref>''Citizen V'' mini-series</ref> They fight [[Citizen V]] (John Watkins III), however, Andrea discovers that Citizen V is actually [[Helmut Zemo]]'s mind transferred into the real Citizen V's body by [[Fixer (comics)|Techno]] after being decapitated by [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] under [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]'s orders. Zemo quickly kills Andrea to keep her from telling anyone the truth.

After Andrea's death, Zemo has the [[Purple Man]] brainwash Andreas into taking the "'''[[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]'''" alias. Purple Man has him flay the skin from Andrea's corpse to incorporate the resulting leather into his sword's hilt, allowing him to channel their shared powers through his sword. Andreas breaks free of Purple Man's control and joins the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Andreas continues to be a member under the Thunderbolts' new leadership. Teammate and current field leader [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] has approached Andreas with a reassurance. If he helps kill [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], Moonstone would be able to make a move to usurp the mentally fragile [[Norman Osborn]] as the Thunderbolts' director. Thus two factions seem to be forming amongst the Thunderbolts with Andreas and Moonstone on one side while Songbird and [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]] stand on the other. Despite his considerable skill, he has been defeated twice; the first is when [[Jack Flag]] hit him with the flat of his own sword, and the second is when [[Steel Spider]] threw him through a window and a flat-screen television using a metal limb.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #114</ref>

Under the control of four imprisoned telepaths, Swordsman has taken over the "'''[[Baron Strucker]]'''" title and shaved his head in his father's honor. He has gained the loyalty of several guards by paying them well, and ordered them to set off a bomb in the ''Zeus'' (the Thunderbolts' carrier) to initiate a lockdown. He declares to one of his guards that Norman will bring him back his sister or everyone in Thunderbolts Mountain will be killed.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #118</ref> After a detachment of guards kill most of his loyal guards, Strucker kills off the remaining attacking guards. He then encounters [[Mac Gargan|Venom]] declaring to eat Strucker. The two fight, and Strucker runs Venom through with his sword, activating his energy powers while the sword is in Venom's body.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #119</ref> Soon afterwards, Osborn snaps from the pressures of running the Thunderbolts, and the Green Goblin brutally attacks Andreas, [[Crucifixion|crucifying]] him to a wall with small goblin-daggers.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #120</ref>

Not long afterward, it is discovered that Andreas used [[Arnim Zola]] to make a clone of Andrea von Strucker. Although Andreas has his sister back, he decides to complete his Thunderbolts contract, leaving the group as a free man. In order to protect Andrea's clone while on missions, Andreas skins his arm, giving the flesh to his sister's clone to hold, allowing her to use their shared powers.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #122</ref> Andrea's clone accompanies Andreas and the Thunderbolts during the [[Secret Invasion|battle]] against the [[Skrull]]s, and witnesses as Moonstone incapacitates Andreas and attempts to make a deal with the Skrulls.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #123</ref> Andrea's clone then attacks Moonstone. While she is preoccupied with Moonstone, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] kills her from behind. Osborn later convinces Andreas that the Skrulls killed his sister.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #124</ref> Andreas also saves Songbird when Bullseye attempts to kill her.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #127</ref> Andreas later confronts Osborn with the revelation that he was not being offered a slot on Osborn's [[Dark Avengers|personal Avengers]] as well as never planning on fulfilling the vow to resurrect his sister or to give him a full Presidential pardon after his contract ended. During the confrontation, his momentarily insane employer stabs Andreas through the chest, apparently killing him with his own sword, and throwing him out over the mountain.<ref>''Dark Reign'' #1</ref>

Andrea and Andreas returned to the living and have opened Club Fenris, a supervillain club in Manhattan. When questioned about their demise and subsequent return from the dead, they stated that their father "took care of it".<ref>''Illuminati'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of genetic engineering with their X-Genes when they were still [[in utero]], Fenris were able to fly and generate energy blasts, but only when they were holding hands. When holding hands, Andreas could generate concussive force blasts while Andrea could generate disintegration beams. Swordsman uses various hidden blades; his primary sword blade is sheathed in an adamantium alloy and can shoot a [[grappling hook]]-like projectile. His sword's hilt is wrapped with Andrea's skin to release powerful [[bioelectric]] blasts of concussive force.
