==Fictional character biography==
A quiet woman with super speed, Black Racer first joined the fourth [[Serpent Squad]], robbing a casino in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].<ref name="Captain America #337">''Captain America'' #337</ref>  [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] took note of this, and invited the Serpent Squad to join his [[Serpent Society]].<ref>''Captain America'' #341</ref>  They accepted, but were really just involved in a ploy to get [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] into the leadership position of the Society. Black Racer was among the several members to side with Viper and betray Sidewinder.<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #10</ref> She was ordered by Viper to search all the hospitals in the area for the injured former leader.<ref>''Captain America'' #342</ref>  However, after Viper abandoned the group, Black Racer continued to serve with the Society under leadership of [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]].<ref>''Uncanny X-men Annual'' #13</ref><ref>''Captain America'' #365-367</ref> She also participated in a race between [[super hero]]es and villains with super speed.<ref>''Quasar'' #78</ref>  However, she disappeared for quite some time, only resurfacing recently alongside the rest of the Serpent Society as they sought to exact their revenge on [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]].<ref>''Captain America'' #379-382</ref>

She has been seen as member of the [[Serpent Society]] under Cobra's leadership.
