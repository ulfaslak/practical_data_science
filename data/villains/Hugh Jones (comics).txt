'''Hugh Jones''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Hugh Jones first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]] #180'' (Dec 1974) and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Sal Buscema]].

==Fictional character biography==
Hugh Jones was the son of a Texas oil [[millionaire]] and inherited the company [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Republic Oil & Gas]] after his father’s death.<ref name="Web of Spider-Man Annual #5">''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #5</ref><ref>''All New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' #9</ref>

With Jones's awareness and approval, Republic Oil's Simon Krieger arranged the murders of [[Howard Stark]] and [[Maria Stark]].<ref>''Iron Man: The Iron Age'' #1</ref> Jones and executives Krieger, John T. Gamelin and Jonas Hale attempted the takeover of [[Stark Industries]]. They used surreptitious purchases of Stark stock and the use of superhuman agents Saboteur and the Dogs of War. Following Krieger's arrest, Hale had Krieger killed in jail. To help separate the company from Krieger, the Republic Oil executives oversaw the company's change to the identity of the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]].<ref>''Iron Man: The Iron Age'' #2</ref>

An ex-lover of Jones tried to shoot him, but either missed or wounded him.<ref name="Web of Spider-Man Annual #5"/>

Jones later attended the premiere of the Captain America movie at the Strand Theatre in New York. Jones was kidnapped by the [[Serpent Squad]] (consisting of [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], [[Eel (comics)|Eel]], [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]] and [[Princess Python]]).<ref>''Captain America'' #180</ref> The rebel [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] [[Krang (Marvel Comics)|Warlord Krang]] had recovered and delivered the [[Serpent Crown]] to Viper. Jones immediately fell under the mental control of [[Father Set|Set]] as he instructs all Roxxon workers to cooperate with any demands. The Serpent Squad then took Jones to a central [[Pacific Ocean]] oil derrick where Jones followed Krang's instructions to pump water underneath the sunken city of [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]] in an attempt to raise the city. The police, along with [[Captain America|Nomad]] and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], interrupted the Serpent Squad's plan, however, and Krang reclaimed the Serpent Crown and fled. Jones then reversed the process that was to raise Lemuria.<ref>''Captain America'' #181</ref>

Jones voluntarily maintained a link to Set in the Serpent Crown's absence. Set informs Jones of Nomad's identity. Jones then sent men to recover the Serpent's Crown.<ref name="Web of Spider-Man Annual #5"/> Jones later sent a message about the [[Red Skull]]'s location that this paid his debt of Nomad rescuing him from Warlord Krang and the Serpent Squad.<ref>''Captain America'' #185</ref> Once he recovered it, he began wearing it invisibly.<ref name="Marvel Two-In-One #66">''Marvel Two-In-One'' #66</ref>

With the power of Set, he was able to make psychic contact with a group of businessmen called the Serpent Cartel, acolytes of Set from the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] known as [[Earth-712|Earth-S]]. This Earth is where the [[superhero]] group the [[Squadron Supreme]] resides, and that universe's version of the Serpent Crown has managed to gain control of the minds of many of the leaders of America's largest corporations and even that alternate [[United States|America]]'s [[President of the United States|President]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]].<ref name="Web of Spider-Man Annual #5"/>

Following Roxxon's purchase of the Brand Corporation, Jones was at the Brand Corporation facility in [[Jamaica, Queens]]. When the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] broke into a Brand Corporation facility during their investigation, Jones used an interdimensional transporter to bring the Squadron Supreme to his Earth and they captured the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #141</ref> When the Avengers escaped, the superhero team and the Squadron Supreme were sent back to Earth-S with the interdimensional transporter when the police came to investigate.<ref>''Avengers #144</ref> After deceiving and dismissing the police investigators, Jones used the Serpent's Crown to speak to Nelson Rockefeller.<ref>''Avengers'' #147</ref> When the Avengers again invaded the Brand Corporation facility, Rockefeller informed Jones that the Avengers have overthrown him. Jones sent [[Orka (comics)|Orka]] against the Avengers where he defeated some of them until Orka was defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Moondragon]]. Jones ordered the execution of the other Avengers, but they escaped and Jones was captured.<ref>''Avengers'' #149</ref>

Using Brand Corporation and Roxxon Energy Corporation's facilities, Jones fashioned his own superpowered serpent for a Serpent Squad to retrieve a second Serpent's Crown which the Avengers brought back from Earth-S and dropped into the Pacific Ocean. Jones was given the Serpent's Crown of Earth-S by [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] (who retrieved it upon being hired by Jones). Upon wearing both Serpent Crowns, Jones gained a scaly appearance and used these powers to assume complete control over the residents of Washington DC for the purpose of putting them under Set's control. Jones allowed the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] to enter unopposed so that he can control them and then created versions of the Serpent Crown's recent previous wearers to fight the threesome. While simultaneously fighting Scarlet Witch and Thing physically, Jones was surprised when Scarlet Witch capitulated and Thing took advantage of Jones's memory disorientation to wrench the Serpent Crown from Jones's head.<ref name="Marvel Two-In-One #66"/>

Following his traumatic separation from the Serpent Crown, Jones was driven insane and was hospitalized in a mental hospital. He was succeeded as Roxxon president by Gamelin (the Vice President of Foreign Operations) and would eventually be succeeded by other men.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition'' #11</ref>
