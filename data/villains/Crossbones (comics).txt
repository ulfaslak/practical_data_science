Brock Rumlow led the Savage Crims gang on New York City's [[Lower East Side]], during which time, he assaulted fifteen-year-old [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Rachel Leighton]] and fought Rachel's two brothers, killing the elder brother.{{issue|date=November 2013}} Rumlow fled, entering [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]'s school for criminals, within three years becoming an instructor under the name '''Bingo Brock'''.{{issue|date=November 2013}}

As a mercenary, Rumlow enlisted with Albert Malik, the [[communism|communist]] [[Red Skull#Albert Malik|Red Skull]], in [[Algeria]], serving the Red Skull under the name '''Frag''' until he was sent to invade [[Arnim Zola]]'s [[Switzerland]] chateau; Rumlow was ultimately the only team member to survive the assault.{{issue|date=November 2013}} There, he also met and impressed, Johann Schmidt, the original [[Nazism|Nazi]] Red Skull, who accepted Brock's services and code-named him as "Crossbones".{{issue|date=November 2013}}

The true Red Skull sent Crossbones to observe [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]'s progress acquiring the [[Ulysses Bloodstone|Bloodstone]] fragments and to obtain them.<ref>''Captain America'' #359–360</ref> He stowed aboard [[Captain America]]'s flagship, and entered Zemo's ship to steal the Bloodstone fragments. He overpowered [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], and shot a crossbow bolt that coupled with Captain America's [[Captain America's shield|shield]]. Crossbones was forced to shatter the Bloodstone fragments when the alien entity known as the Hellfire Helix used it to take control of [[Heinrich Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]]'s body; the destruction of the Bloodstone discorporated the Hellfire Helix.<ref>''Captain America'' #361–362</ref> Knowing that his master would be infuriated by the Bloodstone's loss, Crossbones kidnapped Diamondback to [[Madripoor]] as bait for Captain America. He challenged Captain America to retrieve Diamondback, but the Captain defeated him, although Diamondback escaped, and the Red Skull ordered Crossbones to desist and return to headquarters.<ref>''Captain America'' #363–364</ref> The Red Skull then ordered him to retrieve the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]] after the Controller's breakout from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Captain America'' #365</ref> With the [[Machinesmith]], Crossbones investigated the Red Skull's disappearance.<ref>''Captain America'' #368</ref>

Desperate to regain his position as leader of the Skeleton Crew, Crossbones kidnapped Diamondback, imprisoning in an abandoned subway station and forced into a brutal regime of combat training.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Crossbones believed that he had brainwashed Diamondback into betraying Captain America, but Diamondback was actually laying a trap for Crossbones.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Diamondback stole samples of Captain America's blood from the Avengers' mansion, then accompanied Crossbones to the Red Skull's mountain fortress.{{issue|date=January 2013}} The two were captured and imprisoned, and the Red Skull rehired Crossbones on a temporary basis.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He was later attacked by [[Cutthroat (comics)|Cutthroat]], the Skeleton Crew's new leader, who feared that Crossbones will try to take back his position as the Red Skull's right-hand man.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Crossbones killed Cutthroat, never realizing that Cutthroat was actually Diamondback's older brother.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Crossbones later stabbed Diamondback during Diamondback's escape attempt, only to later save with a blood transfusion in order to use as bait.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He was critically wounded by flying shrapnel during an assault on the fortress by Captain America and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and imprisoned.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

The Winter Soldier then beat Crossbones into unconsciousness, while Crossbones simply laughed. Falcon then turned Crossbones over to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.{{issue|date=November 2013}}

In ''[[Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America]]'', [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], along with Daredevil and [[Doctor Strange]], broke into S.H.I.E.L.D. to interrogate Crossbones and threatened to kill him. Crossbones revealed no knowledge of his hiring by the Red Skull. Wolverine left him a bloody mess on the floor after being convinced by Daredevil to spare his life.<ref>''Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America''</ref>

S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Tony Stark arranged for [[Professor X]] to scan Crossbones' mind for information, but Professor X found that [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|someone]] had erased several parts of his memory in order to prevent such a scan.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} Sin and a new incarnation of the [[Serpent Squad]] have broken Crossbones free of S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} They then capture the Winter Soldier when confronting Lukin to find out a relationship with the Red Skull.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

When Sin and the Serpent Squad attacked the Senate Building, [[Bucky Barnes]] arrived as the new Captain America. After battling and injuring many of the Squad, Crossbones attacked Barnes.

At the start of the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' event, Crossbones has become a member of the new Thunderbolts team formed in the aftermath of Siege.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Thunderbolts-Luke-Cage-100209.html |title=Luke Cage Powers into THUNDERBOLTS as Heroic Age Leader |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref> Government agents, working with [[Luke Cage]], add Crossbones to the team knowing that he cannot be reformed, hoping that his extreme methods will alienate the other Thunderbolt members and push them towards rehabilitation.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #144</ref> During the team's first mission, Crossbones was exposed to corrupted [[Terrigen Mists]];<ref name="Thunderbolts #147">''Thunderbolts'' #147</ref> during the events of Shadowland, Crossbones manifested the ability to fire a powerful, piercing beam of energy from his face, theorizing that this ability originates from his exposure to the Terrigen mists. He uses this ability to murder a police officer.<ref name="Thunderbolts #149">''Thunderbolts'' #149</ref> Fearing that the Thunderbolts are close to being disbanded following Cage's decision to leave, Crossbones attempted to escape alongside [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. During the attempt, Crossbones used his new ability to fight the unsuspecting Steve Rogers. Crossbones was defeated and discharged from the Thunderbolts, after Ghost revealed his murder of the police officer.<ref name="Thunderbolts #150">''Thunderbolts'' #150</ref> Crossbones is shown incarcerated in a padded cell wearing a straitjacket, apparently no longer able to use his energy beam.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #151</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Crossbones was constantly harassed while he was behind bars, because he was both a former Thunderbolt member and a neo-nazi. Shortly after when he was being beaten up by more thugs, Juggernaut unintentionally causes a break out in the prison facility called the Raft. Man Mountain Mario (the cousin of [[Man Mountain Marko]]) helps defend Crossbones from the thugs. While the two of them were trying to escape, Mario told Crossbones about his grandma who helps criminals leave the border. Crossbones manages to escape and returns the favor by killing Mario to help with his escape.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #159</ref> He confronts some of the former [[Avengers: The Initiative|Avengers Initiative]] members in New Jersey after he escapes the Raft. He fights [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]], [[Frog-Man]], [[Geiger (comics)|Geiger]], [[Scarlet Spider#Scarlet Spiders (Red Team)|Scarlet Spiders]], and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]]. When he's surrounded, he tosses a grenade at Gravity but Geiger catches it and is seriously injured, creating an easy distraction for him to escape.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt'' #2</ref>

During the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Crossbones was seen in one of [[Doctor Octopus]]' facilities. [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]] fights past some Octobots until Crossbones shoots Sabra.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Crossbones was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. When Steve Rogers was at the Pleasant Hill Bowling Alley trying to reason with Kobik, Crossbones attacks Rogers. Before Crossbones can kill Rogers, Kobik's powers de-age Rogers back to physical prime, which allows the Captain to defeat Crossbones.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #7</ref> In the aftermath of the events at Pleasant Hill, Crossbones founds a new version of HYDRA with the Red Skull and Sin.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega'' #1</ref>

Their super-prison was raided by the Underground in their mission to free their captive friends.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
An expert combatant trained in warfare, Crossbones is an accomplished military tactician, and is thus able to formulate strategies on the battlefield. He also has extensive training in martial arts, street-fighting, marksmanship, and various forms of hand-to-hand [[combatives|combat]]. He once served as a student at the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]'s school for criminals, before becoming an instructor there himself.{{issue|date=December 2015}} Physically, Crossbones is tall and well built, but moves with an athletic grace uncommon for a man of his bulk. In addition, he is proficient in the use of various weapons, such as guns, bows, and throwing knives. One of Crossbones' primary weapons are spring-loaded stiletto blades housed in his gauntlets. He also has experience with torture and [[brainwashing]], having effectively "reprogrammed" Sin,{{issue|date=November 2010}} and nearly so with [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]].{{issue|date=November 2010}}

As a member of the Thunderbolts, Crossbones was exposed to corrupted Terrigen Mists during a mission,<ref name="Thunderbolts #147"/> and shortly after manifested the ability to generate a circle of energy in front of his face which could fire energy beams capable of piercing and burning his targets.<ref name="Thunderbolts #149"/> The ability developed to the point where flames engulfed the entirety of his head while still allowing him to fire focused energy beams,<ref name="Thunderbolts #150"/> though these flames could seemingly be doused in water. While his power is active, Crossbones does not appear to be entirely impervious to the flames he generates. After the flames died following his first usage, his mask appeared to have been burnt away and his face was heavily scarred.<ref name="Thunderbolts #150"/>
