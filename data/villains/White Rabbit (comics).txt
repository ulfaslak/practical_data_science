The '''White Rabbit''' ('''Dr. Lorina Dodson''') is a fictional [[supervillain]]ess appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has been depicted as an enemy of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Frog-Man]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
She first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #131 in July 1983, and was created by [[J.M. DeMatteis]], [[Kerry Gammill]], and [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]].

==Fictional character biography==
Born to a wealthy family, the girl who would become the White Rabbit grew up in a safe, secure environment and was showered with all the material possessions she desired. However, she was bored, and only found entertainment from classic literature, such as ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'', her favorite. As she grew older, her family married her off to an older gentleman named Lewis Dodson (a name derived from the author of the Alice in Wonderland books, [[Lewis Carroll]], whose real name was '''Charles Dodgson'''). At the time of the marriage, she was twenty-five and he was eighty-two. She resented being treated as a [[trophy wife]], and it is implied that Dodson eventually died while having sex with his wife. After the fact, she would only mention that he "died happy", and subsequently used her inheritance to buy various gadgets so that she could experience a life full of danger and excitement.

She became the '''White Rabbit''', an eccentric female criminal, whose costume resembled a cross between the literary character from ''Alice in Wonderland'' and a [[Playboy Bunny]]. While the White Rabbit is clearly insane to the point of being completely ridiculous, she is quite articulate and has a great knowledge of literature. At some point early in her career she was trying to establish her reputation and confronted Deadpool, who was bonded with the Venom symbiote. She used an array of carrot bombs and mutant rabbits, as well as stealing only watches.<ref>''Deadpool: Back in Black'' #3</ref> She spent her first days as a criminal robbing various fast food joints, most notably "Kwikkee Burger". She and her gang were eventually confronted by [[Frog-Man]] (a frequent customer at Kwikkee Burger), who was able to defeat her hired help only with [[Spider-Man]]'s aid. The White Rabbit escaped, but struck later at a book fair, where she found the two superheroes once again. The White Rabbit, witnessing her men getting defeated, fled using her jet-boots, but they began to malfunction, allowing Frog-Man to knock her into a building.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #131</ref>

Much later, she resurfaced, plotting to get her revenge on Frog-Man. She allied herself with the [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]], but they were defeated by Spider-Man, Frog-Man, and Frog-Man's father, [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' (vol. 1) #185</ref> Ditching the Walrus, she popped up again later with two new villains, Mad Hatter and Dormouse, though they were both actually hired actors, as no other supervillains would work with the White Rabbit. She formed a new plan by capturing [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]] and [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]] and ransoming them for one billion dollars in gold. She also created several genetically-altered rabbits, who were ready to eat Grizzly and Gibbon. The Mayor, however, only offered the White Rabbit $2.50, which caused her to fly into a rage and raise the ransom to five billion dollars (this time the Rabbit demanded that the ransom be paid entirely in quarters), but Spider-Man, under the alias of the Bombastic Bag-Man - as he was currently wanted for murder as Spider-Man thanks to the machinations of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], he was forced to use an alternative costume and lacked the time to get any of his other new costumes (See ''[[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)]]'') - infiltrated the White Rabbit's hideout and battled her giant rabbit robot. She was then knocked out by Grizzly (who claimed he did it so he wouldn't be accused of being sexist); he and his partner had escaped, remembering Gibbon's natural affinity with the Animal Kingdom and thus taming the GM Rabbits.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' (vol. 1) #253</ref><ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' (vol. 1) #256</ref>

White Rabbit was later seen at an auction in which the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom Symbiote]] and [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] suit was sold.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #6</ref><ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #12</ref> She tried to rob another bank, but was interrupted by Grizzly. However, she escaped and the police arrested Grizzly by mistake.<ref>''Secret War: From the Files of Nicky Fury'' #1 (2004)</ref>

In the limited series ''Claws'', the White Rabbit, her outfit modified (now more than ever resembling a Playboy Bunny), became romantically involved with [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]], a man with a dedication for drama and who controls 'Murderworlds', where people are killed off in carnivalesque ways. They go after [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]. The two heroes manage to defeat Arcade and the White Rabbit. They are dropped off in the [[Savage Land]], a prehistoric land hidden deep in the Antarctic. The White Rabbit became queen of a group of tribal warriors.<ref>''Claws'' #1-3</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, White Rabbit appears as a member of the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s gang. She is part of a sub-group of said gang that attacks [[Mister Negative]]. The motive is because he won't hand over his control of the criminal underworld in New York's 'Chinatown'.<ref>''Dark Reign: Mister Negative'' #1-3</ref>

White Rabbit is next seen in [[Los Angeles]], where she is working as a drug dealer to the rich and famous. One of her clients is Bobby Carr, [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]]'s boyfriend. Carr is also an actor and is using Mutant Growth Hormone to bulk up for a movie role. The Rabbit turned on her client when the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] wanted him to inform them who his dealer is. White Rabbit and her gang attacked Carr and MJ at a trendy Los Angeles club, gassing the party goers. Mary Jane rescued Carr and took out White Rabbit at the club, when the police arrived and took the White Rabbit into custody.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #605</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, White Rabbit (alongside [[Chance (comics)#Chance (Nicholas Powell)|Chance]] and [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]]) attacks Peter Parker and Carlie Cooper at an abandoned lab that [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] is in at [[Empire State University]]. She ends up knocked down by Peter Parker using the moves he learned from [[Shang-Chi]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #669</ref>

White Rabbit later makes a cameo at the Raft at the time when [[Hydro-Man]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], and [[Trapster]] spring [[Doctor Octopus]] (whose mind has been swapped with Peter Parker's mind) out of the Raft.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #699</ref>

White Rabbit was then seen trying to rob a truck with two goons but when the [[Superior Spider-Man]], (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body), arrived they quickly surrendered, as they didn't wanted to be beaten in the same way he previously did to both Boomerang and Vulture.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #4</ref>

White Rabbit later appeared as a member of the Menagerie (which also consisted of [[Hippo (comics)|Hippo]], [[Skein (comics)|Skein]], and a new villain called Panda-Mania). They were on a rampage stealing expensive eggs from an auction. White Rabbit named the group the Menagerie because of the villains' animal themes, even though Skein did not use the Gypsy Moth name. She and the Menagerie are defeated by Spider-Man despite the fact that Skein used her powers to destroy Spider-Man's outfit.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #1</ref> White Rabbit and the rest of the Menagerie later reunite to commit a diamond heist, which led to another defeat at Spider-Man's hands.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Sean Ryan|penciller = Brandon Peterson|inker = Brandon Peterson|story = I Can't Help Myself|title = The Amazing Spider-Man Annual|volume = 3|issue = #1|date = 10 December 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

White Rabbit next hires [[Howard the Duck]] to procure Pym Particles for her, but the plan is foiled by [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chip Zdarsky|penciller = Katie Cook|inker = Katie Cook|colorist = Heather Breckel|letterer = Travis Lanham|editor = Will Moss|story = Logic and Proportion|title = Howard the Duck|volume = 5|issue = #4|date = 24 June 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> She later participates in a gang war, battling the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] in the Third Precinct.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Gerry Conway|penciller = Carlo Barberi|inker = Juan Vlasco|colorist = Israel Silva|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe and Devin Lewis|story = Spiral: Conclusion|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 3|issue = #20.1|date = 12 August 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, White Rabbit allies with Walrus and the new [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]] for a plan that involves tampering with New York City's drinking water. The three villains are located and defeated by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and are taken to the refurbished Ryker's Island, now called the Cellar.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dennis Hopeless|penciller = Javier Rodriguez|inker = Alvaro Lopez|colorist = Javier Rodriguez|letterer = VC's Travis Lanham|editor = Nick Lowe|story = What to Expect|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 4|issue = #1|date = 7 October 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

White Rabbit later appeared as a member of the Hateful Hexad alongside Bearboarguy, [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Ox (comics)|Ox]], [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]], and [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]]. During the Hateful Hexad's disastrous fight against Spider-Man and [[Deadpool]], the battle is crashed by Itsy Bitsy, who brutally murders most of the villains, traumatizing White Rabbit who was saved by Deadpool.<ref>''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #9</ref>

==Abilities and equipment==
The White Rabbit has no superhuman abilities but is well-educated (at least a Bachelor of Arts degree in Literature or its equivalent) and knows some martial arts.

The White Rabbit is obsessed with the works of Lewis Carroll, and her equipment reflects this: her weaponry includes an umbrella that shoots razor-sharp or explosive carrots, a large, rideable, heavily armed robot rabbit, genetically-engineered killer bunnies and jet-boots. She also has two custom-modified vehicles: a [[zeppelin]] called the Flying Hare, and a van called the Bunnymobile.

Due to her ridiculous appearance, insanity, lack of judgement and bad reputation, few people take her seriously and dismiss her as a raving lunatic.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Adventures===
White Rabbit appears in the ''[[Marvel Adventures Spider-Man]]'' series. She is romantically interested in [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], and even writes to him when he is in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. White Rabbit plans a series of [[Lewis Carroll]]-inspired robberies alongside Venom, while he pretends to be Spider-Man's new unwanted sidekick. However, Spider-Man figures out the plan and easily defeats Venom and White Rabbit.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man'' #35</ref>
