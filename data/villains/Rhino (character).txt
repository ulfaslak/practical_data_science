'''Rhino''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Although more than one character has assumed the identity of Rhino, the first of these, and the one primarily associated with that identity, is '''Aleksei Sytsevich''', who was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]], and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #41 (Oct. 1966).

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Rhino has been featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated television series]], arcade and [[video game]]s, and merchandise such as [[action figure]]s and [[trading card]]s.

A version of Rhino using powered battle armor, portrayed by [[Paul Giamatti]], appeared in the 2014 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''.

==Publication history==

Rhino returned in ''[[Hulk]]'', vol. 2, #104 (June 1968), and although he dies at the end of the story, the character proved popular enough to be revived,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} becoming a perennial opponent for both Spider-Man and the Hulk. The character achieved significant exposure in the 1980s and 1990s, appearing in both a solo capacity and as a villain for hire in over a dozen titles. Significant appearances included starring in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1–4 (May–Aug. 1991); the "[[Flowers for Rhino]]" storyline in ''[[Spider-Man's Tangled Web]]'' # 5–6 (Oct.–Nov. 2001), which is told from the character's perspective; and ''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #13–15 (Jan.–Mar. 2008), in which Rhino begins to rethink his lifestyle.

==Fictional character biography==
Aleksei Sytsevich was a thug who worked for [[Eastern Bloc]] scientists. The scientists subjected him to a process that gave him an artificial skin covering, which granted him superhuman strength.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #43</ref> After being empowered, Aleksei Sytsevich rebels against the agents who gave him his powers and destroys their laboratory.  He is subsequently hired to kidnap [[Colonel]] [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] in order to obtain extraterrestrial spores to which Jameson has been exposed during a space mission. Jameson is rescued and Rhino defeated by the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. Rhino is imprisoned and kept there with sedation but soon breaks out and continues to try to kidnap Jameson. Spider-Man uses a web imbued with a chemical developed by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]] to melt off his Rhino hide and then knocks him unconscious.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #41–43 (Oct. – Dec. 1966)</ref>

After serving his entire prison term, Rhino is approached by the same scientists, who bombard him with [[gamma radiation]] (exposure to which granted the character [[Hulk|The Incredible Hulk]] his super-powers) to increase the Rhino's strength. The scientists also equip him with a more durable, acid-proof suit that "compliments" the gamma ray procedure, granting the Rhino even more strength while he wears it. Rhino agrees to find and kidnap [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] (the Hulk's [[alter-ego]]) for his knowledge of gamma radiation; the Rhino then trains to fight the Hulk. However, the Rhino finds himself hopelessly overpowered in the ensuing battle, as the Hulk shrugs off his strongest blows, pummels him to the brink of death, and leaves him in a [[coma]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #104 (June 1968)</ref>

The character is brought out of his coma by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] months later. The Leader plans to interrupt Banner's wedding to [[Betty Ross]] using a ray to transform him into the Hulk and make him kill Ross; he revived Rhino to protect him from the Hulk's inevitable desire for revenge. However, Rhino betrays the Leader by attacking Banner the moment he transforms. Rhino is still unable to harm the seemingly invulnerable Hulk, and he turns on the Leader after the Leader accidentally shoots him. Rhino is caught in the explosion of the Leader's ship and again left in a coma.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #124 (Feb. 1970)</ref> Leader, who was [[paralyzed]] after a previous encounter with Hulk, finds and takes mental control of the still-comatose body of Rhino and attacks Hulk. The battle eventually leads to an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Planet|world]], where Leader abandons control of Rhino and flees. Bruce and an unconscious-but-now-recovered Rhino travel back to Earth via a [[rocket]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #157–159 (Nov. 1972 – Jan. 1973)</ref>

Rhino reappears with [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], and the pair activate a [[gamma bomb]] at the [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] base in an attempt to destroy Hulk. [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]] deactivates the bomb, and Hulk tricks the villains during combat, forcing them to collide and knock each other unconscious.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #171 (Jan. 1974)</ref> Rhino reappears as a member of the supervillain team, the [[Emissaries of Evil]] (consisting also of [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], [[Solarr]] and the [[Cobalt Man]]), in search of a rare [[Gemstone|jewel]]. Opposed by superhero team, the ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'', Rhino and Solarr initially hold their own until defeated by [[Doctor Strange]], who has been possessed by the jewel and become the [[Red Rajah]].<ref>''Defenders'' #42–43 (Dec. 1976 – Jan. 1977)</ref> While in hiding, Rhino is found and outwitted by scientist [[Doc Samson]] and is eventually defeated.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #218 (Dec. 1977)</ref>

Rhino joins the criminal group the [[Sinister Syndicate]] to battle Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #280–281 (Sep. – Oct. 1986)</ref> Rhino also battles [[Iron Man]] in the city of [[Los Angeles]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #238 (Jan. 1989)</ref> Rhino and accomplice [[Blacklash (comics)|Blacklash]], in the employ of criminal mastermind [[Justin Hammer]], also hunt and capture a fellow villain [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], who has absconded with advanced weaponry.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #319 (Sep. 1989)</ref>

When Rhino robs a bank and a security guard is accidentally killed, he is humiliated by the [[Punisher]] and saved by Spider-Man before being killed. Rhino is then captured by [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]] (the son of [[Kraven the Hunter]]).

During ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline, Rhino decides to give up his life of crime entirely. He surrenders to the police and pleads guilty to all charges against him. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] removes his Rhino costume, and he is sentenced to 25 years in Ryker's Island. The Russian Mafia and other criminal gangs try to recruit him, but he denies them, even going so far as to completely avoid a breakout at one point. For his good behavior and cooperation, he is released early on parole. Upon release, he is met by [[Doctor Tramma]], who wants to re-invent Rhino. Sytsevich declines Doctor Tramma's offer and tries to begin a new life, dating (and eventually marrying) a waitress and residing in a small apartment in [[Yonkers]]. Doctor Tramma eventually uses someone else to create a new and improved Rhino. Sytsevich feels he needs to face and kill the new Rhino to get rid of him, but Spider-Man convinces him to promise otherwise and helps Sytsevich keep his new life by defeating the new Rhino.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #617">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #617 (March 2010)</ref> The new Rhino attacks Sytsevich at one of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s press meetings. Feeling he could not break his promise to Spider-Man, Sytsevich lies to the new Rhino, telling him he will agree to fight him in his suit, but he instead goes into hiding with his wife Oksana. Before they arrive at their safehouse, the new Rhino attacks again, and Oksana dies as a result. Sytsevich redons his old Rhino suit and attacks the new Rhino. With one hit, Sytsevich completely destroys the new Rhino's suit. Spider-Man begs Sytsevich to stop, but the grief-stricken Rhino disregards him and kills the new Rhino.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #625">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #625 (March 2010)</ref>

Rhino is invited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to join his supervillain team where he becomes involved in securing some specific items for him. He shows up after Spider-Man makes [[Freak (Marvel Comics)#Freak (Spider-Man villain)|Freak]] collide with [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. Spider-Man talks him down from a fight.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #644. Marvel Comics.</ref> Rhino is later seen as a member of Doctor Octopus' [[Sinister Six]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Rhino is among the Sinister Six when Spider-Man and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] engage them on the Mediterranean coasts. Rhino defeats [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] after Thor sends Electro into the atmosphere.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683</ref> Rhino is seen guarding one of Doctor Octopus' facilities in [[Korea]].

Marvel Comics.</ref> Rhino reveals he wanted to watch the world burn, stating that the loss of his wife had changed him, and that he is prepared to die. When Doctor Octopus self-destructs his own lair, Rhino pins Silver Sable to the floor in a flooding corridor, telling Spider-Man he will remain there, taking Silver Sable with him to death. Knowing Spider-Man will blame himself for his fellow hero's death, Rhino sees it as an opportunity for revenge. Rhino and Silver Sable are apparently drowned, despite Spider-Man's defeating Doctor Octopus.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While in Doctor Octopus' dying body, Spider-Man meets him and Oksana in the afterlife during a post-mortem experience.<ref>[[Slott, Dan]] (w). ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event as part of the lead-up to the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Rhino resurfaces months later having survived his apparent demise. He has remained in hiding in Tahuexco, [[Guatemala]]. A mysterious [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|red-suited man]] approaches Aleksei and persuades him to do the red-suited man's bidding. Although Rhino was not up to it at first, he takes up the red-suited man's offer when he has a somehow-revived Oksana by his side.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #2.

==Powers and abilities==
Mutagenic chemical and radiation treatments, including gamma ray bombardment, provides Rhino with superhuman strength, heightened levels of speed and stamina and a high degree of durability. Rhino's superhuman speed allows him to run and/or exercise at high velocities, especially over short distances. He frequently "charges" his opponents in this manner, enabling him to cause great harm to most enemies and the surrounding area. Rhino is notorious, however, for his lack of agility and slow reaction time. This makes it nearly impossible for him to change direction when running at such high speeds and causes him to miss his target and collide with the wrong object.

Rhino's enhanced musculature is much more efficient than that of a normal human and generates considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity. At his peak, he can exert himself physically for up to 24 hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood starts to impair him.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Rhino has some experience in hand-to-hand combat, though he is generally much more of a brawler. Even so, his extreme levels of strength, stamina and resistance to injury make him a formidable opponent regardless of a foe's superior fighting skills.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Rhino possesses a thick polymer mat suit that resembles the physique of a [[rhinoceros]] and covers his entire body except for his face. The suit is highly resistant to damage and extreme temperatures, and it is also equipped with two horns, designed to mimic the general shape and function of actual rhinoceros horns, capable of penetrating two-inch plate steel. His first suit, more crude in overall design, was originally bonded to his skin, and he was unable to remove it. This suit was eventually destroyed and a second, removable suit, more form-fitting in its design, was created by [[Justin Hammer]]. This suit was given to Rhino after he underwent additional gamma ray treatments that further heightened his powers. The new suit was also designed to enhance some of his powers, using gamma ray treatments.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Without the suit, Rhino still possesses great superhuman strength and is highly resistant to conventional physical injury, such as most high-caliber bullets, extreme temperatures and impact forces. While wearing the suit, his strength is slightly increased, while his durability is enhanced to a much more significant degree. The suit also allows him to withstand high-caliber bullets, exposure to temperature extremes of cold and heat without the suit cracking or melting or his own bodily tissues suffering damage, falls from great heights, light anti-tank weaponry, explosive concussions and potent acids without sustaining injury.

==In other media==
{{long plot|section|date=August 2015}}

===Television===
* Rhino made two appearances in the first season of the 1967 ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Ed McNamara]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In the episode "Horn of the Rhino", Rhino steals some military equipment to try to make an explosive weapon which [[Spider-Man]] is blamed for, but Spider-Man realizes he is hiding in the rhinoceros enclosure of a zoo. Rhino is defeated with pepper and Spider-Man baking some mud with a heating device. In the episode "The Golden Rhino", Rhino steals a shipment of gold in order to make a gold statue of himself, which he succeeds in after stealing more gold, but is captured by Spider-Man's new webbing: instant steel. He later 'returned' in a third-season budget-saving 'mishmash' episode called "Rhino" which uses footage from his other episodes and where he also attempts to make another gold statue of himself, but is again webbed up.

[[File:The Rhino (Spider-Man, TAS).jpeg|thumb|right|Rhino as he appears in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* Rhino appears several times in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Don Stark]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} While his origin is not detailed in the series, he still retains his abilities from the comics. Here, he is shown as very unintelligent. First appearing in the episode "The Alien Costume" Pt. 1, he is hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to steal a mineral from [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]'s space shuttle after crash landing to Earth. Kingpin later sent Rhino to obtain another item where he fights Spider-Man in the black suit. Spider-Man fights the suit's urges to finish off Rhino. In the episode "The Alien Costume" Pt. 3, Spider-Man encounters Rhino on the rooftops and fights him where Rhino commented how he missed the black suit previously wore in their last encounter. Rhino was assisted in battle by [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] managing to bury Spider-Man in rubble. By the time Spider-Man emerges from the rubble, the web-slinger finds that Rhino and Shocker have been webbed up by [[Eddie Brock|Venom]]. In the episodes "The Insidious Six" and "Battle of the Insidious Six", Rhino later becomes a member of the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] after he, [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], [[Mysterio]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and Shocker are sprung from prison by Kingpin. As in one episode, Spider-Man easily fools him into thinking that he is Chameleon and tricks him into attacking the other Insidious Six members (because of this Rhino unintentionally damages Shocker's electrical suit). In the "Six Forgotten Warriors" episodes, Rhino was brought back together with the Insidious Six with Vulture acting as Mysterio's replacement. When looking for the keys for Red Skull's doomsday device, Rhino attacks Robert Frank and later, when it appears the villains are victorious, boasts he will soon be "the new Duke of Jersey" (in response to which Spider-Man mocks Rhino's lack of ambition). After Kingpin was badly hurt by Electro (Red Skull's son Rheinholdt Kragov), Rhino left with Doctor Octopus, Scorpion, Shocker and Vulture as they are not going to get paid for their services and went back to their own lives.

With Hulk's help, Spider-Man persuades [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] to let Rhino be a student at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy albeit only if Spider-Man responsible for Rhino's actions. Rhino continues to make appearances in further episodes (such as "Ant-Man", "Attack of the Synthezoids", "The Revenge of Arnim Zola" [Parts 1 & 2] and "Contest of Champions" [Part 4]).

* Rhino appears in the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' video game, voiced by [[John DiMaggio]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} This game's version of Rhino has spikes on parts of his costume and claws on his fingers. In the main version of the game, the player briefly engages Rhino in a "boss fight" after he steals a powerful chemical weapon and terrorizes the people on the streets of Manhattan. Serving as the game's first boss, Rhino is easily defeated by Spider-Man and left for the police, whearas the weapon is destroyed during their battle. In the PC version of the game, Rhino is also the first boss, who is fought after escaping from a maximum security prison. The police trap Rhino in an energy cage, which serves as the arena for the fight between him and Spider-Man. Rhino is easily defeated by tricking him to ram into the cage's walls, which electrocute him, but he escapes from the cage, only to ram into a gas station. The explosion knocks Rhino unconscious, but he is rescued from the police by [[Doctor Octopus]], whom he then begins working for. Later, during Doc Ock's heist at [[Oscorp]], he dispatches Rhino to fight Spider-Man inside a room with six generators, while he escapes.

After defeating Vulture, Spider-Man learns from him that Rhino and Shocker are at a warehouse at the docks and goes there, where he first fights Rhino alone, before facing both villains at the same time. Spider-Man manages to defeat them by tricking Shocker to attack Rhino with his vibro-shock gauntlets and by tricking Rhino to destroy the platform that Shocker is standing on, which collapses on him, and leaves both of them for the police, not before Shocker reveals him Doc Ock's plan.
* The Ultimate Marvel version of R.H.I.N.O. appears in the 2005 ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' game, voiced by [[Bob Glouberman]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} He first appears rampaging through Queens and Spider-Man is forced to chase him and save the civilians he endangers, before eventually cornering him in a parking lot, where the two fight. Spider-Man defeats R.H.I.N.O. by hitting him in a weak spot located on his back and then discovers his pilot to be a short man named Alex O'Hirn, whom Spider-Man leaves for the police. O'Hirn speaks mostly in Latin, appears to be very intelligent, and works for [[Bolivar Trask]], as his company made the R.H.I.N.O. armor; strangely, this makes this version of R.H.I.N.O. the exact opposite of the original version. On the game's web site, it is revealed that the R.H.I.N.O. armor was originally designed to be controlled by a computer, before O'Hirn concluded that his own mind was more powerful than any computer and decided to use the suit for himself.

Spider-Man decides to use Rhino's strength to his advantage and releases him from his cell to help him free the Tinkerer. Rhino proves to be a very useful ally, as Spider-Man needs to get through a large door in order to get to the Tinkerer, which is powered by several generators that only Rhino can destroy; however, Rhino is still very dangerous and will sometimes launch indiscriminate attacks that can hurt both the enemies and Spider-Man. After making their way past the security system and finding the Tinkerer, Spider-Man and Rhino arrive at a lift leading out of Ryker's Island, where the player is given two choices: trick Rhino into returning to his cell, or activate the lift and allow Rhino to escape, so that he could also help deal with the symbiote inavsion. Regardless the choice, Rhino then becomes one of the 7 allies in the game and the player can summon him at any time during gameplay to help them fight enemies; unlike the other allies, Spider-Man will manually ride Rhino through the swarms of enemeies.

Alongside [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Rhino serves as one of Spider-Man's oldest enemies, having already fought him several times during the hero's past eight years career, and, some time prior to the events of the game, was defeated by Spider-Man and imprisoned in the Raft, a maximum security prison designed especially for super-villains. After Otto Octavius (now calling himself "[[Doctor Octopus]]") attacks both Ryker's Island and the Raft, resulting in massive prison breakouts, he releases Rhino, Electro, Scorpion, Vulture and [[Mister Negative]] and recruits them to form the [[Sinister Six]], promising to fulfill each one's desires; Rhino wishes to have his armor removed. When Spider-Man comes to investigate the breakout, Rhino attacks the hero while he is fighting escaped inmates, and later joins his fellow Sinister Six members in ambushing the hero after Electro lured him to a landing pad. Spider-Man is easily defeated by the Sinister Six, although Octavius orders them not to kill him (because, as it is revealed at the end of the game, Octavius is aware of his secret identity). The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Rhino being sent to destroy the medical aid stations set up by [[Oscorp]] for the people infected with the Devil's Breath virus. After Spider-Man stops Scorpion from succeeding with his task - to poison the city's water reservoir - he joins forces with Rhino to help him with his task, and the two are later seen at the docks, fighting some [[Silver Sable|Sable]] International mercenaries who are guarding the stations. [[Miles Morales]] accidentally encounters Scorpion and Rhino while he is at the docks, trying to get some antibiotics, but he manages to escape from them and then calls Peter Parker to tell him about what has happened. The police later tracks down Scorpion and Rhino at the docks and Spider-Man arrives to defeat the two villains and foil their attack. Spider-Man ultimately defeats both of them, turning them against each other and trapping them inside a shipping container, just as the police arrives to take them back into custody. In his character biography, Spider-Man states that Aleksei hates being called "Rhino", and that he needed a couple of weeks to recover after their very first battle, with Rhino destroying several city blocks in the process.
