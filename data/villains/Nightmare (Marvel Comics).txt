'''Nightmare''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted most commonly as one of [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Ghost Rider]]'s major enemies. Nightmare is the ruler of a Dream Dimension.

==Publication history==
Nightmare first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (the first appearance of his enemy, Dr. Strange) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

==Fictional character biography==
He is the evil ruler of a "[[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|Dream Dimension]]", where tormented humans are brought during their sleep. He roams this realm on his demonic black horned horse named Dreamstalker. He appears as a chalk-white man with wild green hair, a green bodysuit, and a ragged cape. He was the first foe met by [[Doctor Strange]], when a man who was having troubled dreams went to Strange for help, though it is revealed this is due to him committing a murder. Later Nightmare imprisons several humans in his dimension, but Strange frees them. When Doctor Strange forgot to recite a spell before he slept, Nightmare started tormenting him, before Strange was freed after tricking Nightmare by casting an illusion of one of Nightmare's enemies. {{issue|date=January 2013}}

Nightmare is a demon from the dimension Everinnye, like his "cousin", the [[Dweller-in-Darkness]]. Nightmare is dependent on the human race's need to dream. Without this ability, Nightmare would cease to exist, but humanity would go insane. At one point Strange and Nightmare had to join forces to prevent that from happening.<ref>Doctor Strange (vol.2) # 53</ref>  Nightmare has run afoul of [[Spider-Man]], [[Captain America]], [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and [[Squirrel Girl]] on different occasions. Nightmare also served under [[Shuma-Gorath]] and warned Strange that the demon would be a force that even the Sorcerer Supreme would have trouble defeating, and he once joined [[Fear Lords (comics)|the Fear Lords]], a group of supernatural creatures who fed on fear, to attack Dr. Strange together. Their plans were undone when [[D'Spayre]] tricks him into competing with the [[Dweller-in-Darkness]] over who could frighten humanity more.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol. 3 #40</ref>

Nightmare is the father of the [[Dreamqueen]], a similar being who rules her own "dream dimension".  She was conceived when Nightmare raped a [[succubus]] named Zhilla Char.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' vol.1, #67</ref>

Nightmare's realm is not part of The Mindscape, but the [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalkers]] are aware of him and consider him an enemy. Because Sleepwalkers do not have to sleep, Nightmare has never been able to affect or dominate them. He sought to do this through the hero Sleepwalker, who had been connected into the brain of the human Rick Sheridan. Nightmare sent Sleepwalker back to his own realm, with a monitor to assure the hero Rick was not being tormented. Rick was being tormented, with the intent of driving Sleepwalker mad and thus giving Nightmare access to the minds of Sleepwalker's people. The hero was not fooled and sacrificed his return home in order to stop Nightmare.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Later, Nightmare was able to access human minds through the concept of the 'American dream'. Many people who were deeply patriotic or had achieved a degree of success through hard work were going on violent rampages. Nightmare was soon stopped by the combined forces of Captain America, [[Sharon Carter]], and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]{{issue|date=January 2013}}

In the ''Tempest Fugit'' storyline of ''The Incredible Hulk'' it is revealed that Nightmare has been plaguing the Hulk for years with hallucinations, misdirections, and manipulations of reality, by empowering himself from the effects of the [[9/11]] terrorist attacks.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #81</ref> His second, more benevolent, daughter ''Daydream'' is also introduced in this storyarc. Nightmare here claimed that this daughter was conceived by forcibly entering the mind of the Hulk's late wife, [[Betty Ross|Betty Ross Banner]], raping her in her sleep, and is temporarily killed by the Hulk in retaliation.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

When Hercules and the [[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]] needs to make their way to the [[Skrull]] gods' realm during the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, they require a map of the [[Dreamtime]], and barter with Nightmare for it. Nightmare agrees, in exchange for access to the fears of the five gods; however, he actually intends to use these divine fears to conquer the world. Hercules and the others escape his realm, having stolen the map via trickery as Mikaboshi had created a shadow duplicate of himself to fool Nightmare. Nightmare summons up an army of monsters to attack them, but they escape.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Nightmare later attempts to revenge himself on Hercules by manipulating the supervillain [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] into trapping Hercules and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] in a labyrinth they constructed. The ploy fails, and Nightmare withdraws.<ref>''Deadpool Team-Up'' #899</ref>

He later plots to conquer the entirety of fiction, adding it to his realm of nightmares, but was defeated by the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four: True Story'' #2-3</ref>

During Osborn's [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]], it was revealed that Nightmare is [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]]'s father, which explains Trauma's fear powers.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Special'' Vol 1</ref>  He later manifests on Earth and proves to be a problem for the Avengers Resistance and the Initiative.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #29-30</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] (now adopting the title of Chaos King) has amassed an army of alien slave gods and is attempting to destroy absolutely everything and become the only being in the Universe once more. He travels to Nightmare's realm while they are trying to torment Hercules with visions of Amatusu-Mikaboshi and quickly defeats the demon. Nightmare attempts to join Amatsu-Mikaboshi's forces but the ancient force of nature doesn't get tricked by his begging and destroys the heart, apparently killing Nightmare. His apparent death is felt by those who have psionic powers and it is later revealed that those who fall asleep enter into a state of berserk rage.  Amatsu-Mikaboshi steals Nightmare's powers and minions.<ref>''Chaos War'' #1</ref>

Nightmare was later seen tormenting Loki as part of a plan to garner greater powers in ''The Terrorism Myth'' storyline.{{issue|date=January 2013}}
