==Fictional character biography==
Nimrod is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]-hunting Sentinel from an [[alternative future]] and was created by the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] ruling that timeline. 
When [[Rachel Summers]] travels backwards in time to the present, he follows Rachel. Although not capable of time travel by himself he was transported back in time by [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] using their powers to change time to prevent [[Kulan Gath]]'s occupation of New York. Thus Nimrod saves the life of construction worker Jaime Rodriguez by slaying a mugger (Kulan Gath's destined host), who would have otherwise killed Rodriguez. In gratitude Rodriguez offers Nimrod a job and a home with his family, not realizing who or what the shape-shifting Sentinel truly is.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #193</ref>

After gathering information about the timeline in which he finds himself, Nimrod eventually changes his prime directive from the extermination of all mutants, having determined that such widespread destruction is not necessary in this era, to only the extermination of mutants who were regarded as outlaws by the government, such as the [[X-Men]]. He fights the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. He hunts Summers and the X-Men, but is defeated by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] when Rogue absorbs the mutant powers of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Kitty Pryde]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Based on a plan that Kitty conceives before losing consciousness, Rogue uses Nightcrawler's teleportation to teleport part of Nimrod's body away, with Rogue's and Colossus's combined invulnerability protecting Rogue from the resulting physical strain in a manner that Nightcrawler could not have handled.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #194</ref> Some time after this, Nimrod garners a reputation with the public of New York City as a heroic [[vigilante]], assuming he is simply a man in powered armor. He also adopts the more human personality '''Nicholas Hunter''' as part of a cover alias as a construction worker.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #246</ref>

Nimrod later faces the combined forces of the X-Men and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] and proves himself as a powerful threat, killing Black Rook [[Friedrich Von Roehm]], causing [[Harry Leland]]'s fatal heart attack, nearly killing Nightcrawler and badly injuring Rogue and [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #209</ref>

When Nimrod comes across a piece of the gigantic Sentinel [[Master Mold]] while working on a construction site, his programming is immediately co-opted; Master Mold merges with Nimrod, using its systems to rebuild Nimrod in its own image. The X-Men are initially hard pressed to defeat the reborn Master Mold, but Nimrod comes to their aid, claiming he has evolved as well and no longer views them or mutants as a threat. Nimrod asserts enough control over Master Mold to render it immobile, and even convinces it that it has become a mutant as well. Thus, to fulfill its prime directive to exterminate mutants, it must self-destruct. The remains of both robots are pushed through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], a mystical gateway that causes all who passed through it to be reborn with new bodies.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #247</ref>  Nimrod and Master Mold are merged into the being [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}

In ''[[X-Force]]'' #35, a modern-day version of Nimrod appears. Created by an offshoot of [[Project Wideawake]], this version is based on the technology derived from the Nimrod from the future. It deactivates itself when [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] convinces Nimrod that its existence could cause a [[paradox]] and damage the timestream.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Reverend [[William Stryker]] found a damaged Nimrod as he enters the 616 Marvel timeline from an alternate one.<ref>''New X-Men'' #26</ref> Stryker uses Nimrod's memories to plan an attack on the X-Men and other mutants, but Nimrod alters its memories to facilitate its own escape, and Stryker is defeated. During the ''[[New X-Men]]''<ref>Formerly ''New X-Men: Academy X''</ref> story arc "Nimrod", it searches for [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], whom it believes is its creator. Nimrod believes Forge can repair its damaged body, but Forge instead transfers Nimrod's programming into a new body which Forge can control. Believing Forge to be in danger, the New X-Men travel to his apartment to help him. This eventually leads to Nimrod gaining control over his body and attacking Forge and the New X-Men. Nimrod is defeated when [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] overloads Nimrod's temporal unit, blasting Nimrod out of the timestream. Nimrod survives and travels back in time to March 1985<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #191</ref> with its memory corrupted, resulting in its existence in the 'true' timeline — with Rachel's history erased — becoming a temporal loop paradox.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

The series ''X-Force'' reveals that the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] held on to most of Nimrod's body and fuse it with Bastion's head to reform Bastion.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #1 (2008)</ref> He then, using the [[Technarch]] [[transmode virus]], revives numerous villains that have destroyed many mutants.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

During the events of [[Second Coming (comics)|Second Coming]], he personally confronts [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], Rogue and Nightcrawler, leading to the death of the latter. Bastion appears to be reverting more and more to fully being Nimrod. Some time later, Bastion unleashes an endless horde of Nimrods from an unknown future to destroy the X-Men. However, X-Force, Cypher and Cable go to that future and destroy the Master Mold controlling them. At the end of the crossover, the original Nimrod (Bastion) takes his original form but is destroyed by Hope. The chest and head of Nimrod are later shown to be exhibited in X-Force Headquarters. Deathlok identifies it as version 32.1 and the possibility for its future to come to be is 1.34%.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #8</ref>

During a brief glimpse three months into the future seen in ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]'', [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] are shown fleeing from a new model of Sentinel. Havok refers to the machines as Nimrod units, and mentions that they were built by [[Tony Stark]].<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nimrod is the most advanced form of Sentinel robot. Nimrod can convert his outward appearance to resemble that of an ordinary human being. Nimrod can also reconstruct himself so as to make improvements in his robotic form and internal systems that will make him a more formidable opponent. Even when smashed to pieces, Nimrod can reintegrate the portions of his body to become whole again. Apparently Nimrod's electronic [[consciousness]] can somehow exist independently of his physical body, at least temporarily. Physically Nimrod is categorized in the "[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]" as possessing "Class 1000" strength because Nimrod could engage the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] in hand-to-hand combat.

Nimrod contains highly advanced computer systems as well as scanning devices that make it possible for him to determine whether a human being is a superhuman or not; if they are, he can determine the nature of their superhuman abilities. Like present day Sentinels, Nimrod can draw upon devices and systems within his robotic body in order to cope with or neutralize an opponent's superhuman power once he has determined the nature of that power.

Nimrod is capable of projecting energy blasts, magnetic energy to levitate material, create [[force shield|force fields]], and can teleport. Nimrod has a weakness for elemental attacks such as lightning or extreme cold.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] reality featured '''Nimrod Model Sentinels''' in ''[[Ultimate Comics: X-Men]]''. This depiction are new Sentinels developed by the US government after the [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum Wave]]. One such model chases and successfully takes down [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] until rescued by [[Kitty Pryde]]. They are eventually infused with [[Jason Stryker|William Stryker Jr]]'s brain-patterns when manifesting mutant [[Technopathy|powers]] for the first time in years.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #5</ref> The Nimrod Sentinels later build a base for their operations based for Master Mold.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #6</ref><ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #9-11</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* Nimrod appeared in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]''. Similar to the original comics, this version is a futuristic Sentinel from [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop's]] timeline. In the episode "Days of Future Past" [Part 1], it fought Wolverine and then followed Bishop to the 1990s. Nimrod later fights the [[X-Men]] while trying to go after Bishop. It was defeated by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s mutant weather-controlling ability and Bishop. Nimrod has a supporting role in "One Man's Worth" [Parts 1 & 2]. Nimrod, under [[Master Mold]]'s orders, acts as a warden to [[Trevor Fitzroy]] and [[Bantam (comics)|Bantam]] in Charles Xavier's assassination in 1959. After disguising itself as its intended target, Nimrod fights Bishop, [[Shard (comics)|Shard]], and alternate versions of Wolverine and Storm but is once again defeated. Although Fitzroy and Bantam are successful, Nimrod is tasked by Master Mold to eliminate the four time-traveling mutants then Master Mold's own reluctant mutant allies. While Fitzroy and Bantam defect, Nimrod presumably eliminates Shard and [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] but not other three time-traveling mutants. Returning to 1959, Nimrod again disguises itself as a friend (voiced by [[Kay Tremblay]]) to get close to Xavier. However, Nimrod's fight with the three time-traveling mutants doesn't end in its favor. 
* Nimrod has a cameo appearance in ''[[X-Men Evolution]]''. In the series finale, one of [[Professor X]]'s glimpses into the future shows Nimrod leading an army of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]]s.
* A Nimrod-esque concept called '''[[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel Hounds]]''' appear in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' animated series. The Sentinel Hounds are based on [[Bolivar Trask]]'s experiments to replicate [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s mutant healing factor in order to combat mutants in the Sentinel-dominated future.

===Film===
* Nimrod-esque Sentinels appear in the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]''. This variation are smaller than the original Sentinels at about four meters tall, and have the ability to change themselves to mimic and counter mutant abilities, based on Trask Industries' experiments with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique's]] self-altering mutant abilities. Because of this, they can be seen altering their bodies to imitate the abilities of the X-Men they fought. Most commonly, they are seen altering the shapes of their arms into extremely sharp blades and claws to impale their victims and can fire energy blasts from their heads. Some of this variant's powers and overall resistance are very similar to Nimrod from the original comic story.<ref name=fxguide>{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/future-threat-x-men-days-of-future-past/|title=Future threat – X-Men: Days of Future Past|publisher=Fxguide|first=Ian|last=Failes|date=May 27, 2014|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name=sentinels>{{cite video|title=Sentinels: For a Secure Future|location=''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' Blu-ray|year=2014|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|format=Featurette}}</ref>
