After Mar-Vell defeats the Kree Sentry, Yon-Rogg contacts [[Ronan the Accuser]] to pass judgement on Mar-Vell's actions. Ronan declines the offer stating that the mission was not jeopardized by Mar-Vell's actions.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #1</ref>

Yon-Rogg was on his spaceship at the time when Mar-Vell was fighting [[Super-Skrull]] and hopes that Super-Skrull would kill Mar-Vell.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #2</ref> After Mar-Vell breaks free from Super-Skrull's ship, Yon-Rogg refuses Mar-Vell's offer to return to Earth so that he can stop Super-Skrull.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #3</ref>

Yon-Rogg later sabotages a rocket carrying deadly bacteria that was bound for space where it crashes into the ocean. When Mar-Vell arrives at the Cape, he is ordered by Yon-Rogg to prevent the humans from stopping the rocket from releasing the bacteria where Mar-Vell has his encounter with [[Namor]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #4</ref>

Yon-Rogg has Mar-Vell put on trial for being "Un-Kree" by letting Namor beat him. Though Ronan the Accuser has Mar-Vell take out Mr. Logan upon him finding out his identity before a device Mar-Vell had ended up putting Mr. Logan into a coma.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #5</ref>

During Mar-Vell's holographic training program, Yon-Rogg cranks up the setting hoping that Mar-Vell would die from the experience. Following Mar-Vell's fight with Solam, Yon-Rogg plans to put Mar-Vell on trial before Ronan the Accuser again.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #6</ref>

Yon-Rogg then plans to kill Mar-Vell's fellow cape member [[Carol Danvers]] with Kree weapons with Mar-Vell saving her. Yon-Rogg plotted to use this to invoke jealory in Una. After Mar-Vell had defeated [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]], Yon-Rogg continues to make Una jealous of Mar-Vell and Carol's relationship.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #7</ref>

When an Aakon spaceship approaches Earth, Yon-Rogg orders the Kree to attack the spaceship since the Kree have been age-old enemies of the Aakon race. During their fight on the moon, Yon-Rogg is injured and Mar-Vell had to kill the Aakok spaceship's leader in order to protect Yon-Rogg. While Yon-Rogg is recuperating, Mar-Vell assumes control of the Kree ship.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #8</ref>

When Mar-Vell starts to develop a friendship with Carol Danvers, Ronan the Accuser orders Yon-Rogg to lead some Kree soldiers into executing Mar-Vell. Yon-Rogg is happy to oblige.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #10</ref> After Una dies from her injuries upon being caught in the crossfire between the Kree and the Aakons, Zo frees Mar-Vell from the control bands that Yon-Rogg and has Mar-Vell go after Yon-Rogg for revenge upon bestowing new powers onto him.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #11</ref> Mar-Vell uses his illusion casting to taunt Yon-Rogg into thinking that he is alive.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #12</ref> While a supply ship is restocking the Kree ship, Mar-Vell ends having a brief fight with Yon-Rogg before returning to Earth to save Carol Danvers from Man-Slayer.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #13</ref>

After being told by the Supreme Intelligence that Zo was actually Prime Minister Zarek in disguise as part of a plot by Ronan the Accuser to overthrow the Supreme Intelligence, Mar-Vell fends off Zarek, gains a new costume from the Supreme Intelligence, and leaves to go deal with Yon-Rogg.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #16</ref>

Mar-Vell meets [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] who tries on Mar-Vell's Nega Bands which he uses to have a brief fight with Yon-Rogg. Yon-Rogg manages to escape afterwards.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #17</ref> Yon-Rogg begins his next plot against Mar-Vell. When Yon-Rogg captures Carol Danvers and Mar-Vell catches up to him, Yon-Rogg uses a Psyche-Magnetron to create a Kree [[Mandroid]] to help him fight Mar-Vell. During the fight, Carol Danvers is injured and the Psyche-Magnetron is damaged with some of its energies irradiating Carol Danvers. After Mar-Vell destroys the Kree Mandroid, Yon-Rogg is seemingly killed when the Psyche-Magnetron explodes. This battle led to Carol Danvers being exposed to the damaged Psyche-Magnetron's energies which would lead to her becoming [[Ms. Marvel]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #18</ref>

Yon-Rogg is later revealed to have survived the Psyche-Magnitron's explosion, gaining a telepathic link with Carol Danvers' via a shard of the Magnetron that is lodged in her brain (which is also causing a brain-damaging lesion in Carol's head). After stealing the remains of the Psyche-Magnetron from Carol, Yon-Rogg tries to give it to the Kree Empire only to be turned down. He then takes the name "Magnetron" and uses Carol's memories and its power to recreate enemies from her past before attempting to drop a Kree city on top of New York City. Carol is able to destroy the telepathic link and Yon-Rogg's powers by aggravating the lesion in her head until it bursts, though at the cost of all her memories.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' Volume 7, #10-#14</ref>

A flashback series shows Yon-Rogg's association with Mar-Vell and Una. The three are part of a Kree mission deep into [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] territory. Their mission is to rescue or terminate a Kree general that knows valuable military intelligence. Yon-Rogg earns the thanks of the Shi'ar ruler and the [[Imperial Guard]] when the Kree rescue them from Skrull attackers. The Kree move on and find the general. A Brood attack leaves Mar-Vell, Una and Yon-Rogg stranded for weeks; this is after Mar-Vell risks his life to save Yon-Rogg. The three are rescued by the same Shi'ar they previously saved.<ref>"Untold Tales Of Captain Marvel" #1-3 (1997)</ref>
