==Publication history==
Created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[David Micheline]], Darren Cross debuted in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #47 (April 1979). The character made his first appearance as Yellowjacket in ''The Astonishing Ant-Man'' #12 (September 2016), which was written by [[Nick Spencer]] and illustrated by Brent Shoonover.

==Fictional character biography==
Darren Cross is a millionaire and the founder of a [[Cross Technological Enterprises|successful corporation]], which rivals its top competitors. Cross was diagnosed with a heart condition due to overwork, and had to use an experimental nucleorganic pacemaker in order to save his life. The pacemaker was a success but enhanced Cross's circulatory system, mutating his body and giving him superhuman abilities. With a side effect that overuse causes the burning out of his heart, Cross went through various heart transplants, which led him to capture surgeon Dr. Erica Sondheim to replace his heart and to abduct "donors" from the slums.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #47. Marvel Comics</ref> This attracted the attention of the second [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] looking for Sondheim in order to save his [[Cassandra Lang|own daughter]]'s life. The resulting battle with Ant-Man burned out Cross's heart, as Sondheim had reimplanted his old, worn-out heart prior to Ant-Man crashing the surgery.<ref name="MarvelPrem48">''Marvel Premiere'' #48. Marvel Comics</ref> 

After his death, the family company created by Darren had been controlled by his cousin [[Crossfire (comics)|William Cross]],<ref>''Hawkeye'' #1-4</ref> and later his son [[Augustine Cross]].<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 1 #145</ref>

Darren's body is later revealed to have been kept in a cryogenic state as Augustine was obsessed with bringing Darren back to life and eventually forces Dr. Sondheim to help.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics</ref> Enlisting Crossfire's assistance, Augustine had orchestrated Cassie Lang's capture as the girl's heart is required to withstand the unique conditions when transplanted into Darren. While infiltrating Cross's company to rescue Cassie, Ant-Man came across his restored nemesis.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics</ref> Darren engaged in combat against Ant-Man while Ant-Man buys time for Sondheim to transplant another heart to Cassie. Darren is ultimately forced to flee with his son when the Pym Particles now in his body caused him to shrink down.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Darren Cross was later approached by [[Power Broker]] to demonstrate his latest "Hench" App by hiring [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] to kill Ant-Man. However, Cross was unwilling to give Power Broker the 1.2&nbsp;billion dollars demanded for investment in the Hench app, causing Power Broker to cancel the demo and cancel Whirlwind's assassination on Ant-Man.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #1</ref>

Cross later represented his own company when he attended a meeting at the Universal Bank with Tiberius Stone of [[Alchemax]], [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] of Fisk Industries, [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] of Shaw Industries, [[Zeke Stane]] of Stane International, Frr'dox of Shi'ar Solutions Consolidated, and Wilhelmina Kensington of Kilgore Arms where they discussed [[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]]'s and [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]]'s plans to exploit the Ten Realms of Asgard. Cross also saw the arrival of Exterminatrix of the Midas Foundation who knocked out Dario and declared herself a new member of their assembly.<ref>''Mighty Thor'' Vol. 2 #8</ref>

In order to combat Ant-Man, Cross recruited [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] to work for his company. Egghead helped Cross control his Pym Particle abilities with the Yellowjacket armor.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #12</ref> Yellowjacket, Egghead and Crossfire attacked during his nemesis's trial in Cassie's place, but were engaged by Ant-Man, [[She-Hulk]] (Scott's defense attorney), Miss Thing, [[Grizzly (comics)#Grizzly (Maxwell Markham)|Grizzly]], [[Machinesmith]] and Stinger. Yellowjacket is defeated by Stinger, which led to [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Peggy Rae|Peggy Rae]]'s final approval of Scott's superhero life and Scott's acquittal in court.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #13</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Yellowjacket appears as a member of [[Helmut Zemo]]'s Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Darren Cross possesses a keen scientific mind and is a successful businessman. The experimental nucleorganic pacemaker that saved Cross from his heart condition also granted him superhuman abilities such as enhanced physical attributes, increased [[sensory perception]], and a regenerative healing factor.<ref name="MarvelPrem48"></ref> After acquiring [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie Lang]]'s Pym Particle-equipped heart during a heart transplant, Cross gained near uncontrollable size-shifting abilities; he is at risk of growing when angered and shrinking when calm.

[[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] later uses the Yellowjacket suit for Cross to help him control his Pym Particle quantum powers. The armor grants Cross enhanced durability and flight, in addition to featuring "stingers" that can discharge powerful blasts of bio-electrical energy.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #12</ref>
