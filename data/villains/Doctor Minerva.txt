Minn-Erva was born in Edelix, on the planet Kree-Lar. She became a [[geneticist]] and an agent of the Kree Empire. She was stationed on the Kree science cruiser, ''Ananim''. She orbited the Earth in the starship, observing [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #50</ref> She then abducted [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]],<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #51</ref> and lured Mar-Vell aboard the craft. She revealed to Mar-Vell her theory that the two of them would produce superior offspring capable of advancing the evolutionary potential of the Kree species. She was ordered by the science council head Phae-Dor to abandon her mission, but refused and was neurologically overpowered.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #52</ref> She was rescued from the wrecked science cruiser by Mar-Vell.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #53</ref> She later rendezvoused with the Kree scientist Mac-Ronn and docile [[Ronan the Accuser]] on a farm in Sullivan County, Texas.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #55</ref> Later, she observed Ronan revive and escape custody.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #19</ref>

Doctor Minerva later became partner to Kree [[Captain Atlas]], serving aboard the Kree light cruiser ''Ramatam''. She incognito commissioned [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] to steal [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'s quantum-bands.<ref>''Quasar'' #9</ref> She abducted Quasar and revealed to him how she was transformed by the Psyche-Magnetron. She rendezvoused with Captain Atlas, and tried to remove Quasar's quantum-bands, but was instead banished from Earth.<ref>''Quasar'' #10</ref>

Doctor Minerva was a member of the Kree [[Starforce (comics)|Starforce]] during the Kree/[[Shi'ar]] war.<ref>''Avengers'' #346-347</ref><ref>''Thor'' #446</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline, Doctor Minerva hires a group of human soldiers to assault a medical facility to steal a [[Inhumans|Terrigenesis cocoon]] containing an infant Inhuman. As they escape, Minerva is attacked by [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]] and the fight also draws [[Spider-Man]]'s attention. As the two superheroes work together to fight her, Minerva reveals her plan of using the genetic material from Terrigenesis cocoons to create a new breed of Kree Super-Soldiers and shows the early results of her work by transforming into a giant creature to attack the heroes.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #7</ref> During this time, she used the villain [[Clash (comics)|Clash]] and some unnamed people as her hired henchmen. It was later discovered that Minerva's research is not being sanctioned by the Kree Empire. Doctor Minerva is forced to abandon her plan when Spider-Man threatens to inform Kree-Lar of her illegal activities while Clash takes out the other henchmen upon seeing Ms. Marvel with an Inhuman baby.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #8</ref>

Doctor Minerva returned to Earth during the [[Civil War II]] storyline. [[Carol Danvers]], now acting as Captain Marvel and heading up [[Alpha Flight]], engaged her in a brief battle in [[North Fork, California]]. Captain Marvel was unable to prevent her from unleashing a mutagenic virus on the inhabitants of North Fork, who were transformed into crustacean-like creatures. The attack had been predicted by the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] named Ulysses, and was a key reason for Captain Marvel to support using his precognitive visions as a crime-fighting tool.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 8 #6</ref> Doctor Minerva escaped but was tracked to [[South Boston]], where she was planning to spread an upgraded version of the virus through Captain Marvel's hometown. Captain Marvel, Alpha Flight and the [[Ultimates (2015 team)|Ultimates]] were able to stop her, though her genetic experiments allowed her to transform into a monstrous being. She was arrested and imprisoned by a friendly faction of the Kree.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 8 #7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

She also possesses heightened intuitive faculties enabling her to guess correctly significantly higher than chance.
