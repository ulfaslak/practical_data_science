The '''Hobgoblin''' is the alias of several [[character (arts)|fictional]] [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly depicted as enemies of [[Spider-Man]]. '''[[Roderick Kingsley]]''' first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #238, and was created by [[Roger Stern]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]<ref>''[[Marvel Age]]'' #111, April 1992, Marvel Comics</ref> During the late 1980s and most of the 1990s, the Hobgoblin identity was carried exclusively by '''[[Jason Macendale]]''' instead. In 2009, the Hobgoblin was ranked by [[IGN]]'s as the 57th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/57.html |title= Hobgoblin is number 57 |publisher= [[IGN]] |accessdate= 2010-08-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100809124321/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/57.html |archivedate= 2010-08-09 |df=  }}</ref>

==Publication history==
[[File:The Amazing Spider-Man 238.jpg|thumb|left|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #238 (March 1983), the Hobgoblin's first appearance. Cover art by [[John Romita Sr.]]]]

The Hobgoblin was created by writer Roger Stern and artist John Romita Jr. for ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #238 (March 1983). Like other writers Stern found himself under pressure to have [[Spider-Man]] fight the [[Green Goblin]] again, but did not wish to bring [[Norman Osborn]] or [[Bart Hamilton]] back from the dead, have [[Harry Osborn]] become the Green Goblin again, or create yet another Green Goblin. Instead he created a new [[Goblin (Marvel Comics)|goblin]] as heir to the Green Goblin's legacy and developed the Hobgoblin.<ref name="Creators">{{cite book |title=Comics Creators on Spider-Man |last=DeFalco |first=Tom |year=2004 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=1-84023-422-9 }}</ref> Stern recounts that he directed Romita to base the costume on the Green Goblin's but to make it "a little more [[medieval]]-looking", while Romita asserts that he was given no direction beyond using the Green Goblin as a basis. Both agree, however, that the costume was chiefly Romita's design.<ref name="Back35">{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|authorlink= Glenn Greenberg|date= August 2009|title= When Hobby Met Spidey|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|pages= 10–23|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

The character's identity was not initially revealed, generating one of the longest-running mysteries in the Spider-Man comics. According to Stern, "I plotted that first story with no strong idea of who the Hobgoblin was. As I was scripting those gorgeous pages from JR [John Romita, Jr.], particularly the last third of the book, and developing the Hobgoblin’s speech pattern, I realized who he was. It was Roderick Kingsley, that sunuvabitch corporate leader I had introduced in my first issue of ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man|[The] Spectacular [Spider-Man]]]''."<ref name="Back35"/> A handful of readers deduced that Kingsley was the Hobgoblin almost immediately. In order to throw them off the scent, and in the same stroke provide a [[retroactive continuity|retroactive explanation]] for his inconsistent characterization of Kingsley in his early appearances, Stern came up with the idea of Kingsley having a brother named Daniel who sometimes impersonates him, sealing the deception by having the Hobgoblin conspicuously appear in the same room as Daniel Kingsley in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #249.<ref name="Back35"/>

Stern's original plan was to have the mystery of the Hobgoblin's identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the Green Goblin's identity, meaning the truth would be revealed in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #264.<ref name="Back35"/> However, Stern left the series after ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #251. Editor [[Tom DeFalco]] took his place. Wanting to resolve the mystery in a manner that would do justice to Stern's stories, he asked Stern who the Hobgoblin was, but objected when Stern told him it was Kingsley. DeFalco argued that the "twin brother" scheme was cheating the readers since, aside from a single [[thought bubble]], there had been no hint that Roderick even had a brother, much less one who could serve as a double for him. Stern disagreed but said that DeFalco should feel free to choose whoever he wanted for the Hobgoblin's secret identity, reasoning that "I knew that whomever Tom chose, he would make it work."<ref name="Back35"/> Upon reviewing the clues, DeFalco decided that the Hobgoblin was [[Richard Fisk]]. Moreover, he decided that the mystery of his identity should be prolonged as long as possible, since it was the chief element that made the Hobgoblin interesting.<ref name="Back35"/> Through both Stern and DeFalco's runs, the answer to the mystery was continuously teased on the cover art, with the covers of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #245, 251, and 276 all showing Spider-Man unmasking the Hobgoblin.<ref name="SpideyKicksButt"/>

The mystery became further complicated after [[James Owsley]] came on as editor of the Spider-Man titles. Owsley's relationship with DeFalco and artist [[Ron Frenz]] was strained from the beginning, and so when Owsley asked who the Hobgoblin was at a Spider-Man creators conference, DeFalco lied and said it was [[Ned Leeds]]. Owsley then wrote the one-shot ''Spider-Man vs Wolverine'' in which Ned Leeds is killed off (though the actual death is not shown), and instructed ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' writer [[Peter David]] to reveal the Hobgoblin as the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]]. David objected and argued that the only person who fit the clues was Leeds (having been present at the Spider-Man creator's conference, David also thought that Leeds was who DeFalco intended it to be). Because ''Spider-Man vs. Wolverine'' had already been drawn, however, it was too late to undo Leeds's death.<ref name="Back35"/> Thus, the Hobgoblin's identity was revealed posthumously in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289, a double-sized issue. With Spider-Man's then-archenemy now dead, a new Hobgoblin was created from the storyline of Jason Macendale's hatred of the Hobgoblin.<ref name="SpideyKicksButt">{{cite web |url=http://www.spideykicksbutt.com/SquanderedLegacy/SquanderedLegacyPart2.html |title=Squandered Legacy: The Rise and Fall of the HobGoblin Part Two: The Goblin in Decline |author= Fettinger, J.R. |accessdate=2009-02-19 |work= Spidey Kicks Butt }}</ref> Though the posthumous unmasking of the Hobgoblin as Leeds was unpopular with fans, in a 2009 interview David said that he is still proud of the story, arguing that the Hobgoblin being unmasked in a climactic battle with Spider-Man was the sort of tale readers had already seen countless times before, whereas having an archvillain unmasked in a flashback after having been brutally killed by nameless assassins was unprecedented and shocking.<ref name="Back35"/>

Macendale supplanted the original Hobgoblin for a decade (1987-1997). Initially he wielded only the weaponry of his predecessor, but during the 1988-89 ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' [[Crossover (comics)|crossover]] writer [[Gerry Conway]] had him imbued with demonic powers by [[N'astirh]]. In addition to giving him power over hellfire and increasing his strength and speed to far greater than that of the original Hobgoblin, these powers also disfigure Macendale so that his head is even more grotesque than his Hobgoblin mask, and ultimately alters his mind so that he is deluded into thinking that his appearance is normal. Several years later, in the pages of ''Amazing Spider-Man'', Macendale succeeds in purging himself of his demonic powers. Towards the end of Macendale's run as the Hobgoblin he was revamped again, this time with cybernetic implants.

Stern was unhappy with the revelation that his character's civilian identity was Ned Leeds, and in 1997 he wrote a three-issue miniseries, ''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'', with the [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] that Roderick Kingsley was the original Hobgoblin, and had brainwashed Leeds into serving as a [[fall guy]]. Macendale is killed off in this miniseries, and Kingsley is returned to operating as the Hobgoblin. According to Stern, initially he had not known how to resolve the situation of having two Hobgoblins, and it was at the suggestion of the editorial staff that he had Kingsley kill Macendale and take his place.<ref name="Back35"/>

Amoral billionaire fashion designer [[Roderick Kingsley]] was obsessed with [[Norman Osborn]] (aka the original Green Goblin) after discovering locations of various hideouts. Decided to create a name criminal himself instead of just being another Goblin, he altered the formula, the costume and improved the Goblin equipment in order to become the Hobgoblin. Kingsley then frames Ned Leeds for his crimes,<ref name="Hobbylives3">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Bob McLeod (comics)|McLeod, Bob]] | story = Secrets | title = Hobgoblin Lives | issue = 3 |date = March 1997| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> and murders his successor Jason Macendale years later.<ref name=S-MHL#1>''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' #1, January 1997</ref> Kingsley's villainous identity is finally exposed by [[Spider-Man]] and [[Betty Brant]],<ref>''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' #1-3</ref> and he flees to the Caribbean to hide from both the law and his enemies.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #259-261</ref> Roderick's brother and accomplice later poses as him,<ref name=AS-M#691>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #691</ref> attempts to take the Hobgoblin identity and is murdered by Phil Urich who takes up the Hobgoblin mantle himself.<ref name="philurichhobgoblin">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #649</ref> Donning his old costume, Roderick returns to New York and battles Urich, but ends up agreeing to let Urich continue in the role as long as Kingsley gets a share of the profits.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #697 (November 2012)</ref>

===Arnold Donovan===
Arnold Samuel "Lefty" Donovan was a petty thug working for Kingsley until he was exposed to the Goblin Formula as a test subject. Similar to how Osborn got exposed to the formula, Kingsley has Donovan mix the two vital chemicals that were mixed to create the formula. The formula explodes, disfiguring Donovan's face and granting him its power. Donovan is taken to a hospital. Kingsley uses the Winkler process in order to brainwash Donovan. Donovan eventually escapes the hospital and follows preprogrammed instructions to go to a hidden cache of goblin weapons and dress up as the Hobgoblin.<ref>{{Cite comic|title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 244 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]|date=September 1983}}</ref> Donovan impersonates the Hobgoblin and attacks New York City. Spider-Man eventually confronts and unmasks Donovan. Seeing his face (even though it was scarred), Spider-Man recognizes Lefty. Donovan is able to shake off some of the Kingsley programing and starts talking about his boss. Kingsley programs the Goblin glider to crash into the side of a building, killing Lefty with the falling rubble.<ref>{{Cite comic|title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 245 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]|date=October 1983}}</ref>

===Ned Leeds===
{{Main article|Ned Leeds}}
[[Ned Leeds|Edward "Ned" Leeds]] was a reporter working for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. Kingsley brainwashes Leeds to act as a stand-in on many occasions and fool the underworld into thinking that Leeds is the Hobgoblin.<ref>''Hobgoblin Lives'' #3</ref> He is later murdered by the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] after Kingsley decides that he is no longer needed.<ref>''Spider-Man versus Wolverine'' (February 1987)</ref>

===Jason Macendale===
{{Main article|Jason Macendale}}
Around the time when the Rose and Hobgoblin's plan got out of hand, Kingsley wanted to escape from the Hobgoblin identity saw a way out by deciding to target [[Flash Thompson]] for insulting the Hobgoblin on national television that had incurred Kingsley's wrath. Kingsley attempted to frame Thompson as the Hobgoblin, so that Kingsley's criminal enemies might target Flash instead.<ref name="Unmasked">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = Breeding, Brett | story = Unmasked! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 276 |date = May 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> The plan was foiled through intervention of [[Jason Macendale|Jason Philip Macendale Jr.]] who subsequently broke Thompson out of jail, thinking he was doing the Hobgoblin a favor. Macendale was a [[mercenary]] who had been trained by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and various para-military organizations, and was known in his costumed identity [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. When Macendale discovered that Thompson was not the Hobgoblin, Kingsley grew furious, as Kingsley had planned to operate "under the radar" while Thompson was in custody; this began a long-running feud between Kingsley and Macendale when the two battled for the first time.<ref name="Clash">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = Breeding, Brett | story = When Warriors Clash--! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 281 |date = October 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Thompson was ultimately exonerated and released. 

When the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] temporarily abdicated the role at the head of organized crime on the eastern seaboard, the resulting [[gang|gang war]] tore [[New York City]] apart. During the conflict the Hobgoblin and the Rose had a falling out, with the latter ordering the former's assassination for becoming too dangerous. The Hobgoblin sold the Rose's identity to the Kingpin in exchange for information that would aid Leeds in a story, thus reinforcing the illusion of the latter's identity. Also, during the conflict both Hobgoblin and Jack O'Lantern were badly injured and forced to separately retreat. Shaken by the battle, Jack O'Lantern felt he needed to seek another way to destroy his enemy.<ref name="Foes">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Bob Layton|Layton, Bob]] | story = With Foes Like These... | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 276 |date = May 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="Stand">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Josef Rubinstein|Rubinstein, Josef]] | story = ...And Who Shall Stand Against Them...? | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 284 |date = January 1987| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="Arranger">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Owsley, James]] | cowriters = [[Tom DeFalco]] | penciller = [[Alan Kupperberg|Kupperberg, Alan]] | inker = Fern, Jim | story = The Arranger Must Die! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 285 |date = February 1987| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Hoping to give another try at escaping from his identity, Kingsley leaked word to the underworld that Leeds was the Hobgoblin. Taking this information, Macendale paid the supervillain known as the Foreigner to take Leeds out. On an overseas assignment with Peter Parker, Leeds was murdered in his hotel room.<ref name="Wolverine">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Owsley, James]] | penciller = [[M.

Although known in parts of the underworld, this information did not become public until many years later when Macendale revealed it at the end of his trial. For many years Leeds was considered to be the original Hobgoblin.

Kingsley's plan had worked: his enemies thought they had killed the Hobgoblin and now he could take his ill-gotten gains and retire to [[Belize]]. This paved the way for Macendale to take up the role,<ref name="Revealed">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Peter David|David, Peter]] | penciller = [[Alan Kupperberg|Kupperberg, Alan]] | copencillers = [[Tom Morgan (artist)|Tom Morgan]] | inker = [[Tom Morgan (artist)|Morgan, Tom]] | story = The Hobgoblin Revealed! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 289 |date = June 1987| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> an unforeseen development that eventually forced Kingsley to come out of retirement and kill Macendale in order to protect his secret identity, as Macendale had enough information to possibly lead the authorities to discover the true identity of the original Hobgoblin.<ref name=S-MHL#1/>

===Daniel Kingsley===
With Roderick Kingsley having relocated to Ecuador, his brother Daniel Kingsley returned to New York, posing as Roderick with the intention of being the new Hobgoblin.<ref name=AS-M#691/> But when investigating Roderick's old lair at OsCorp to find that Osborn had been working on some new goblin gear with new body armor, a winged jetpack in place of a glider, and a flaming [[energy sword]]. Kingsley also discovers [[Phil Urich]] trying to retrieve some of the gear to show Norah at the ''Daily Bugle''. Urich's "Lunatic Laugh" stuns Kingsley long enough for Urich to decapitate him using his own sword, which allows Urich to claim the Hobgoblin mantle.<ref name="philurichhobgoblin" />

===Phil Urich===
{{Main article|Phil Urich}}
When Daniel Kingsley attempts to assume the Hobgoblin role in New York, [[Phil Urich]], who once used the Green Goblin identity to operate as a hero, is encountered. Kingsley is on the verge of murdering him until Urich uses his "Lunatic Laugh", stunning Kingsley. Urich then kills Kingsley in self-defense and takes on the Hobgoblin identity himself as a supervillain.<ref name="philurichhobgoblin" /> As the new Hobgoblin, Phil becomes one of the Kingpin's agents.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648</ref> The Kingpin's criminal empire is destroyed and Urich's identity is exposed by [[The Superior Spider-Man]]. He is taken down by Spider-Man and arrested until the Green Goblin frees him in exchange for his full loyalty.

===Unknown===
An unidentified Hobgoblin was introduced in the series ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]''.

'''Hobgoblin 2211''' first appears in ''Spider-Man 2099 Meets Spider-Man''. While her costume sports the green-and-purple color scheme of the twentieth-century Green Goblin, she boasted that she was the Hobgoblin of the year 2211. Her identity was not revealed to readers (or to the visiting Spider-Men of previous eras) at the time, but her later reappearance in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' (also written by David) revealed her true identity and origin.

Hobgoblin 2211 is [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Spider-Man 2211|Spider-Man 2211]]'s daughter named '''Robin "Hobby"/"Hob" Bourne'''. Her father always seemed to put his superhero career before raising his own daughter. She wanted to save the universes from 'intersecting'; in other words, having other parallel universes merge with the existing one, causing it to override. She was later arrested by her father for something that she would have done in future: unauthorized time travel, chronal displacement, jumping the tracks to other realities. She was held in a virtual reality prison where she lives a benign and trouble-free existence in what appears to be Kansas. Her boyfriend attempts to free her by uploading a virus into the prison, but inadvertently causes her to be driven insane. She attacked her father with a 'retcon bomb' (a variation on the original Goblins' pumpkin bombs) but it hit her boyfriend instead, erasing (or 'retconning') him from existence.

Now suited up as the Hobgoblin, Robin managed to time-travel to the current year, attacking the current Spider-Man in his reality and derailing an [[Uncle Ben]] from another reality into the present one causing a time paradox. Later, in a confrontation with her father, she threw a 'retcon bomb' at him. Spider-Man, believing it to be no more harmful than a regular pumpkin bomb, caught it with his web and threw it back to Robin, unwittingly erasing her from existence.

===JLA/Avengers===
In the last issue of ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', the Hobgoblin is among the enthralled villains defending [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold, and is defeated by [[Hawkgirl]].<ref>''Avengers/JLA'' #4 (May 2004)</ref>

===Marvel Adventures===
In this continuity, Hobgoblin is an unidentified criminal who found a stash of Green Goblin's weaponry because he had forgotten to leave the entrance locked. Delighted at his new technological power he challenges Green Goblin to a confrontation. Spider-Man defeats them both.<ref>''Marvel Adventures Spider-Man'' #22 (2005)</ref>

===MC2===
The original Hobgoblin made his [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] debut in [[Spider-Girl]] #97, as a hired assassin to kill many of the Spider-Girl characters, including Normie Osborn, Spider-Girl, and Peter Parker. After a fight against both Spider-Girl and her father, he came close to victory, but at the end his only success lay in killing the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], and also in escaping without a trace.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #100 (September 2006)</ref> He attempted a complex plot to become the new kingpin of crime, but was undone due to an act of treachery by his partner, the [[Mindworm]]. Killing the Mindworm, and deciding the New York underworld had become too "hot" for him at the moment, he chose to return to the Caribbean, but vowed someday to come back and finish off Spider-Girl.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #18 (May 2008)</ref> He is later revealed to be the instigator of a mob war against the [[Black Tarantula]], returning to New York to finish the job.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #3 (July 2010)</ref> He defeated [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]] and the [[New Warriors]].
