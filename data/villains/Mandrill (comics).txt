{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
Mandrill first appeared in ''Shanna the She-Devil'' #4. He was created by writer Carole Seuling and artist [[Ross Andru]]. [[Steve Gerber]] dialogued his first appearance and wrote several subsequent appearances, but denied having a hand in the character's creation, saying he was all Seuling's.<ref>https://groups.yahoo.com/group/howard_the_duck/message/1870 August 18, 2005 post to Howard the Duck Club (members only)</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Jerome Beechman was the son of Frederic Beechman, a physicist at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in New Mexico, and Margaret Beechman. Before conceiving his son, an explosion breached the facility's nuclear reactor, bombarding Frederic and a cleaning woman with radiation. When Jerome was born a year later, he possessed black skin (despite both of his parents being [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]) and tufts of body hair. Jerome was despised by his family because of his freakish appearance, and when he was ten his father drove him out into the New Mexico desert and abandoned him.

While wandering the desert, Jerome encountered [[Nekra|Nekra Sinclair]], the daughter of the cleaning woman who had been bombarded by radiation in the same accident that had affected Beecham's father. Although her parents were black, she had been born [[albinism|albino]] white and had developed [[vampire|vampiric]] features. For six years they lived by theft and scavenging until they were attacked by a lynch mob that thought they were monsters. The hatred triggered by the attack manifested Beecham's ability to control women with his pheromones, as well as Sinclair's powers, which the two used to kill some of their attackers and escape the rest.

Now possessing a more monkey-like appearance, Beecham became a professional criminal and took the name [[Mandrill]]. Traveling to [[Africa]], the two plotted to overthrow and seize control of three small nations through a [[cult of personality]] powered by the Mandrill's pheromone ability. They intended to create a society free of the values that had led them to be rejected when they were young. This effort was thwarted by [[Shanna the She-Devil]]. After their battle, Beecham and Sinclair were captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Shanna the She-Devil'' #4</ref> The two escaped, kidnapping Shanna's father in the process and eventually killing him.

For their next plot, they acted as political subversives, using the Mandrill's powers to raise [[Black Spectre#Black Spectre (organization)|Black Spectre]], a cult of black women committed to overthrowing America. As leader of Black Spectre, he battled the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #3</ref>  Alongside Nekra and Black Spectre, he attacked the [[Empire State Building]] and battled Daredevil, the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], and Shanna.<ref name="mnyc">{{Cite book| last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | date = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49–51 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>  Mandrill and his allies were ultimately defeated on the [[White House]] lawn by the heroes.

Mandrill has made no secret of his [[misogyny]]. He has often taken [[rape|sexual advantage]] of his slaves. He married some of his slaves, becoming illegally polygamous. In the pages of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'', it was alluded that he had made the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] one of his many conquests.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027113342/http://www.geocities.com/daredevil_villains/mandrill/mandrill.html Illustration], Daredevil Villain Gallery</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Mandrill is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who exudes [[pheromone]]s that give him the chemically-based ability to attract and enslave women. Certain women of heightened willpower can resist his control. A mild electrical shock can release victims from his control. His power is ineffective against males.

He also has superhuman strength, speed, agility, dexterity, flexibility, reflexes, coordination, balance and endurance comparable to that of a [[great ape]]. He is also a skilled acrobat and hand-to-hand combatant.

Mandrill has above normal intelligence and is a gifted planner and strategist.

In at least one instance, the Mandrill used technological means to alter and augment his power so that the sight of him mesmerized the male [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].{{Issue|date=January 2010}}
