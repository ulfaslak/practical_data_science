==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
Whitney Frost first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #98 (February 1968), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Gene Colan]]. She first appeared as Madame Masque in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #17 (September 1969).

==Fictional character biography==
Madame Masque was born as Giulietta Nefaria, the daughter of the master criminal [[Count Nefaria|Count Luchino Nefaria]], in [[Rome, Italy]]. Her mother died when giving birth and Luchino wanted his daughter to lead a respectable life, so he gave the child to Byron Frost, a wealthy financier and an employee of Nefaria, and Loretta Frost to be raised. Frost called the child Whitney and raised her as his own.

As a young adult, Whitney was a debutante and socialite, and became engaged to politician Roger Vane. Following the Frosts' deaths, Count Nefaria approached Whitney and revealed her true parentage, telling her that Nefaria wants her to take her true father's place as leader of [[Maggia (comics)|the Maggia]], a [[American Mafia|Mafia]]-like organization based on the [[East Coast of the United States]]. Whitney at first refused, but when she tells Roger about her father, Roger leaves her, afraid that her connections to a known criminal would hamper a political career.

Whitney accepted her father's offer to become a professional criminal mastermind and was trained by the Count in strategy, criminal activities and combat. She turned out to be a brilliant student and when her father is imprisoned, she becomes the new Big M, the leader of the Nefaria family of the Maggia. Her role as Big M brought her into conflict with [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #98</ref> Whitney was forced to flee after a raid on [[Stark Industries]]. The plane she escaped in crashed and Whitney's face was scarred, but she was saved by the criminal [[Midas (comics)|Mordecai Midas]] and started to work for him. Midas is obsessed with gold and Whitney hides her face behind a golden mask and uses the alias "Madame Masque".<ref>''Iron Man'' #17</ref>

Madame Masque meets Tony Stark (Iron Man's [[alter ego]]) and the latter shows concern for her despite her scarred face. She turns on Midas to save Stark, but leaves Stark because of her criminal past. Unable to forget Stark, she returns as Krissy Longfellow, Stark's personal secretary. Both come to know each other's secret identity and start a romantic relationship. Their happiness is short-lived as Count Nefaria is dying due to a result of an attempt to gain superhuman powers. Whitney hires the [[Ani-Men]] to bring her father to her and then asks Stark to find a cure for her father. Nefaria tries to use violence to force Stark, and a battle starts between the Ani-Men and Iron Man. Whitney is unable to choose between her father and her lover, and when Nefaria's life-support is damaged in the fight, she goes insane with guilt and grief.<ref>''Iron Man'' #116-117</ref> Whitney returns to the Nefaria Maggia and as "The Director" becomes its leader. She often fights Iron Man and his friends.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

At one point, Frost becomes [[Paranoia|paranoid]] and starts to create copies of herself, known as bio-duplicates. One of her bio-duplicates, known as ''Masque'', becomes an ally of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #397</ref> She also creates robotic servants known as the ''Inner Guard'' and names them individually after notable historical traitors, [[Benedict (Marvel)|Benedict]], Brutus, Fawkes, Quisling, Monmouth (based on [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Vidkun Quisling]] and the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]]) and two other, unnamed members.<ref>''Avengers'' volume 3 #32</ref><ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/innerguardmasque.htm|Inner Guard}} Retrieved 19.July 2013</ref>

One member of the Inner Guard, Benedict, recaptures Masque for Whitney. Masque tries to convince her the Avengers are benevolent and that she should reach out to Stark again, but Whitney is still too fearful to do so. She continues to be a criminal figure of importance, until her father returns from the dead once again and destroys her base. She reluctantly assists the Avengers and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] against Nefaria, but she secretly plans to betray and destroy both sides, her increased paranoia causing her to believe that both sides want only to kill her, despite moments of doubt such as when Stark unmasks in her presence but lowers his face-plate back when preparing to talk to the rest of the Avengers.{{issue|date=December 2015}} Masque again tries unsuccessfully to convince her to side with the heroes, then joins the battle in Whitney's place. Masque uses a weapon designed to disrupt Nefaria's ionic energy that Whitney was saving until the Avengers were dead and Nefaria weakened, and is slain by Nefaria before she can fire the weapon. Madame Masque is shocked by her duplicate's nobility and sacrifice, with Iron Man's dismayed reaction at what appears to be her death compared to Nefaria's glee forcing her to recognize that her duplicate was right about the Avengers. Whitney joins the battle and plays a key role in her father's defeat, her weapon causing him to begin leaking ionic energy until he finally collapses. She renounces her criminal past, and [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-II]] of the Thunderbolts offers her membership, but she declines, departing to parts unknown to consider her future. Before leaving, she asked MACH-II to thank everyone for her, especially Iron Man.<ref>''Avengers'', volume 3 #34</ref>
