==Fictional character biography==
The Dweller-in-Darkness is a [[List of Marvel Comics demons|demon]] from the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|dimension]] Everinnye, like the demon [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]]. The Dweller became shunned by his people for following "The Way of the Shamblu". Like Nightmare, the Dweller feeds on the fear of living beings; fear both increases his powers and keeps him alive.{{issue|date=December 2010}}

In the universe which existed before the current reality, the Dweller caused a fracture in the [[M'Kraan Crystal]] in order to bring about the destruction of the universe and absorb the fear this would cause in every being that existed. Just before the crystal shattered, however, the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] telepathically reached out to the minds of all life and united them in peace, foiling the Dweller's scheme. As the universe came to an end, the current [[Marvel Universe]] was born.<ref>''Adventures of the X-Men'' #11-12 (February–March 1997)</ref>

In this new universe, when he first came to Earth, the Dweller-in-Darkness fed upon the fears created by the war between the humans of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] and the [[Deviants (comics)|Deviants]] of [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]]. The Atlantean sorceress Zhered-Na discovered the existence of the Dweller and banished him with the help of [[Agamotto]] and the Atlantean god Valka. When Atlantis sank, the Dweller absorbed the fear of the inhabitants and used it to create D'Spayre and ordered him to kill Zhered-Na in revenge. D'Spayre manipulated a tribesman to kill Zhered-Na and Zhered-Na's student, [[Dakimh the Enchanter]] would battle D'Spayre over the next millennia, while D'Spayre tried to generate enough fear on Earth to free his creator. During this time the Dweller would create other beings with a similar purpose, including the demoness Spite.{{issue|date=December 2010}} D'Spayre would remain his most powerful creation though.

In the 20th century, the Dweller appeared in the dreams of many humans and told them that they would gain eternal life if they died. These humans would then kill themselves but turn into Shade Thralls, powerful creatures who served the Dweller, but were vulnerable to light. His plan was stopped by the gods [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] who fought the Shade Thralls and destroyed them.{{Issue|date=July 2010}} He also inspired Zoltan Drago to become the first [[Mister Fear]].{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

The Dweller would create new Shade Thralls. These Shade Thralls were destroyed by [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Clea]], but not before the Dweller finally freed himself from his prison. The Dweller witnessed the destruction of his Shade Thralls by Strange and Clea and determined that they were the largest threat to him on Earth. Over the next few months he tried to kill Strange using servants like the [[Dream Weaver (comics)|Dream-Weaver]] and several demons, but Strange defeated them all. Still, Strange's resolve was sapped by the Dweller's servants and he was overcome with fear. The Dweller decided that he had defeated Strange and stopped his attacks.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

Months later, the Dweller gathered the [[Fear Lords (comics)|Fear Lords]] and told them about his plans to create the Great Fear: a terror which would engulf humanity. In fact, the Dweller hoped that the other Fear Lords would be destroyed during this plan by Doctor Strange. Most of the Fear Lords agreed, but the [[Straw Man (comics)|Straw Man]], who was benevolent to humanity, disagreed with their plan and warned Strange. The Fear Lords destroyed the Straw Man before he could tell Strange too much, but they only killed one of the Straw Man's many bodies. The Great Fear started out as the Dweller had planned; several of the Fear Lords were destroyed by Strange and his allies, but D'Spayre told Nightmare about the Dweller's true plans. Nightmare and the Dweller fought, but during their battle they generated so much fear that humanity stopped fearing and started to despair. The two were unable to feed upon this despair, but D'Spayre was and he became more powerful than the two of them. Realizing that D'Spayre had manipulated them, the Dweller attacked him, but D'Spayre destroyed the Dweller's robotic body. His head, the only living part of the Dweller, escaped.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] became involved in a mission against some of the servants of the Dweller-in-Darkness on behalf of the [[Secret Avengers]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Dweller has the ability to generate fear in other living beings. This fear in turn sustains and empowers the Dweller, allowing him to generate even more fear. He also has other undefined mystical powers: he can create independent creatures out of fear like D'spayre and he can turn humans who die under his influence into Shade Thralls, beings made of shadow with superhuman strength. Strong light can kill or banish these thralls.

The Dweller is immortal, doesn't age and even the sorceress Zhered-Na, assisted by powerful beings like Agamotto and Valka, could only banish him, not destroy him.

The "Way of the Shamblu", the Dweller's chosen path in life, involved a ritual where the Dweller removed his head from his own body. His body died, but his head lived on, now as a corporeal being, whereas the other inhabitants of Everinnye are more ethereal. The Dweller's head is attached to a robotic body, which possesses superhuman strength, but it can detach and move with the tentacles near its mouth in case of emergency.

==Other versions==
===Secret Wars 2099===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline in the [[Battleworld]] domain of 2099, Martin Hargood (the 2099 version of [[Baron Mordo]]) used [[Alchemax]]'s virtual unreality laboratory to summon the Dweller-in-Darkness. Meanwhile, [[Spider-Man 2099|Miguel O'Hara]] called in the Avengers to defend the city from the Dweller-in-Darkness allowing the Defenders to intervene without being arrested. While Iron Man, Silver Surfer, Roman the Sub-Mariner, and [[Hulk 2099|Hulk]] confronted the Dweller-in-Darkness, the rest of both teams confronted Hargood. After Hargood was knocked out, Strange was able to reverse the effects of the portal that brought the Dweller-in-Darkness and brought it back to where it came from.<ref>''Secret Wars 2099'' #5</ref>
