{{expand-section|date=December 2016}}

==Fictional character biography==
===Erik Gelden===
Mind-Wave was a megalomaniac criminal possessing mental abilities heightened by his own inventions.  He robbed banks in Europe and America until stopped by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Uri Geller]]. At the time he utilized his 'think tank', capable of firing various weapons.<ref>''Daredevil'' #133. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Mind-Wave's mental abilities failed to warn him about the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], who killed him in the "Bar With No Name" massacre.<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = 1|issue = 319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Mind-Wave was later among the eighteen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> Mirage disguises himself, Mind-Wave, and some of the other criminals as a team of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] trying to kill the Punisher. After the Punisher uncovers the ruse, he captures Mirage, kills Mind-Wave with a grenade, and leaves him with a grenade as a booby trap for the other criminals to find.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #8</ref>

===Mindwave===
A new Mind-Wave appears as a [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] violator. He amuses the officers of a Las Vegas, Nevada police precinct by claiming he was there to officially protest the Registration Act, and clarifying that his codename was different from the man who was called "Mind Hyphen Wave." He then used his telekinetic powers to destroy the station and kill the officers present before calmly surrendering to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #116. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Mindwave is escorted to a cell in Thunderbolts Mountain. When left alone, he begins a telepathic conversation with fellow prisoners Caprice, [[Blue Streak (comics)#Caged Angels|Bluestreak]], and [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)#Caged Angels|Mirage]], during which he suggests that it would be fun to interfere with the surgery scheduled to be performed on [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> However, Bullseye recovers from his surgery while Mindwave's attention is focused on the other Thunderbolts, and kills Mindwave and his allies in their cells using thrown scalpels.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The first Mind-Wave wore a helmet of his own design that boosted his natural mind powers particularly [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], with which he could blindside a non-telepathic opponent at will.  His helmet also enabled him to communicate mentally with others wearing similar helmets, with his "Think Tank" or with other ESPers. Mind-Wave's "Think Tank" was a large, heavily armed vehicle control by his mental powers which he used to rob banks. It had heat-ray cannons. He also carried hand-held versions of the heat ray.

The second Mind-Wave was primarily a very powerful telekinetic, with the ability to destroy structures and halt and redirect hails of bullets in mid-flight. He also had some measure of telepathic ability, which he used to converse with his fellow prisoners and combine his power with theirs, in an attempt to destroy Thunderbolts by driving them insane. He wore a costume composed of dark body armor and a helmet resembling a gas mask.{{issue|date=February 2013}}
