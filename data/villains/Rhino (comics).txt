'''Rhino''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Although more than one character has assumed the identity of Rhino, the first of these, and the one primarily associated with that identity, is '''Aleksei Sytsevich''', who was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]], and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #41 (Oct. 1966).

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Rhino has been featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated television series]], arcade and [[video game]]s, and merchandise such as [[action figure]]s and [[trading card]]s.

A version of Rhino using powered battle armor, portrayed by [[Paul Giamatti]], appeared in the 2014 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''.

Rhino returned in ''[[Hulk]]'', vol. 2, #104 (June 1968), and although he dies at the end of the story, the character proved popular enough to be revived,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} becoming a perennial opponent for both Spider-Man and the Hulk. The character achieved significant exposure in the 1980s and 1990s, appearing in both a solo capacity and as a villain for hire in over a dozen titles. Significant appearances included starring in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1–4 (May–Aug. 1991); the "[[Flowers for Rhino]]" storyline in ''[[Spider-Man's Tangled Web]]'' # 5–6 (Oct.–Nov. 2001), which is told from the character's perspective; and ''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #13–15 (Jan.–Mar. 2008), in which Rhino begins to rethink his lifestyle.

==Fictional character biography==
Aleksei Sytsevich was a thug who worked for [[Eastern Bloc]] scientists. The scientists subjected him to a process which gave him an artificial skin covering which granted him superhuman strength.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #43</ref> After being empowered, Aleksei Sytsevich rebels against the agents who gave him his powers and destroys their laboratory.  He is subsequently hired to kidnap [[Colonel]] [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] in order to obtain extraterrestrial spores to which Jameson has been exposed during a space mission. Jameson is rescued and Rhino defeated by the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. Rhino is imprisoned and kept there with sedation but soon breaks out and continues to try to kidnap Jameson. Spider-Man uses a web imbued with a chemical developed by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]] to melt off his Rhino hide and then knocks him unconscious.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #41–43 (Oct. – Dec. 1966)</ref>

After serving his entire prison term, Rhino is approached by the same scientists, who bombard him with [[gamma radiation]] (exposure to which granted the character [[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]] his super-powers) to increase the Rhino's strength. The scientists also equip him with a more durable, acid-proof suit that "compliments" the gamma ray procedure, granting the Rhino even more strength while he wears it. Rhino agrees to find and kidnap [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] (the Hulk's [[alter-ego]]) for his knowledge of gamma radiation; the Rhino then trains to fight the Hulk. However, the Rhino finds himself hopelessly overpowered in the ensuing battle, as the Hulk shrugs off his strongest blows, pummels him to the brink of death, and leaves him in a [[coma]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #104 (June 1968)</ref>

The character is brought out of his coma by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] months later. The Leader plans to interrupt Banner's wedding to [[Betty Ross]] using a ray to transform him into the Hulk and make him kill Ross; he revived Rhino to protect him from the Hulk's inevitable desire for revenge. However, Rhino betrays the Leader by attacking Banner the moment he transforms. Rhino is still unable to harm the seemingly invulnerable Hulk, and he turns on the Leader after the Leader accidentally shoots him. Rhino is caught in the explosion of the Leader's ship and again left in a coma.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #124 (Feb. 1970)</ref> Leader, who was [[paralyzed]] after a previous encounter with Hulk, finds and takes mental control of the still-comatose body of Rhino and attacks Hulk. The battle eventually leads to an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Planet|world]], where Leader abandons control of Rhino and flees. Bruce and an unconscious-but-now-recovered Rhino travel back to Earth via a [[rocket]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #157–159 (Nov. 1972 – Jan. 1973)</ref>

Rhino reappears with [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], and the pair activate a [[gamma bomb]] at the [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] base in an attempt to destroy Hulk. [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]] deactivates the bomb, and Hulk tricks the villains during combat, forcing them to collide and knock each other unconscious.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #171 (Jan. 1974)</ref> Rhino reappears as a member of the supervillain team, the [[Emissaries of Evil]] (consisting also of [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], [[Solarr]] and the [[Cobalt Man]]), in search of a rare [[Gemstone|jewel]]. Opposed by superhero team, the ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'', Rhino and Solarr initially hold their own until defeated by [[Doctor Strange]], who has been possessed by the jewel and become the [[Red Rajah]].<ref>''Defenders'' #42–43 (Dec. 1976 – Jan. 1977)</ref> While in hiding, Rhino is found and outwitted by scientist [[Doc Samson]] and is eventually defeated.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #218 (Dec. 1977)</ref>

Rhino is then captured by [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]] (the son of [[Kraven the Hunter]]).

During ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline, Rhino decides to give up his life of crime entirely. He surrenders to the police and pleads guilty to all charges against him. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] removes his Rhino costume, and he is sentenced to 25 years in Ryker's Island. The Russian Mafia and other criminal gangs try to recruit him, but he denies them, even going so far as to completely avoid a breakout at one point. For his good behavior and cooperation, he is released early on parole. Upon release, he is met by [[Doctor Tramma]], who wants to re-invent Rhino. Sytsevich declines Doctor Tramma's offer and tries to begin a new life, dating (and eventually marrying) a waitress and residing in a small apartment in [[Yonkers]]. Doctor Tramma eventually uses someone else to create a new and improved Rhino. Sytsevich feels he needs to face and kill the new Rhino to get rid of him, but Spider-Man convinces him to promise otherwise and helps Sytsevich keep his new life by defeating the new Rhino.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #617">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #617 (March 2010)</ref> The new Rhino attacks Sytsevich at one of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s press meetings. Feeling he could not break his promise to Spider-Man, Sytsevich lies to the new Rhino, telling him he will agree to fight him in his suit, but he instead goes into hiding with his wife Oksana. Before they arrive at their safehouse, the new Rhino attacks again, and Oksana dies as a result. Sytsevich redons his old Rhino suit and attacks the new Rhino. With one hit, Sytsevich completely destroys the new Rhino's suit. Spider-Man begs Sytsevich to stop, but the grief-stricken Rhino disregards him and kills the new Rhino.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #625">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #625 (March 2010)</ref>

Rhino is invited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to join his supervillain team where he becomes involved in securing some specific items for him. He shows up after Spider-Man makes [[Freak (Marvel Comics)#Freak (Spider-Man villain)|Freak]] collide with [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. Spider-Man talks him down from a fight.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #644. Marvel Comics.</ref> Rhino is later seen as a member of Doctor Octopus' [[Sinister Six]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Rhino is among the Sinister Six when Spider-Man and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] engage them on the Mediterranean coasts.

When Doctor Octopus self-destructs his own lair, Rhino pins Silver Sable to the floor in a flooding corridor, telling Spider-Man he will remain there, taking Silver Sable with him to death.

While in Doctor Octopus' dying body, Spider-Man meets him and Oksana in the afterlife during a post-mortem experience.<ref>[[Slott, Dan]] (w). ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event as part of the lead-up to the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Rhino resurfaces months later having survived his apparent demise. He has remained in hiding in Tahuexco, [[Guatemala]]. A mysterious [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|red-suited man]] approaches Aleksei and persuades him to do the red-suited man's bidding.

==Powers and abilities==
Mutagenic chemical and radiation treatments, including gamma ray bombardment, provides Rhino with superhuman strength, heightened levels of speed and stamina and a high degree of durability. Rhino's superhuman speed allows him to run and/or exercise at high velocities, especially over short distances. He frequently "charges" his opponents in this manner, enabling him to cause great harm to most enemies and the surrounding area. Rhino is notorious, however, for his lack of agility and slow reaction time. This makes it nearly impossible for him to change direction when running at such high speeds and causes him to miss his target and collide with the wrong object.

Rhino's enhanced musculature is much more efficient than that of a normal human and generates considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity. At his peak, he can exert himself physically for up to 24 hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood starts to impair him.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Rhino has some experience in hand-to-hand combat, though he is generally much more of a brawler. Even so, his extreme levels of strength, stamina and resistance to injury make him a formidable opponent regardless of a foe's superior fighting skills.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Rhino possesses a thick polymer mat suit that resembles the physique of a [[rhinoceros]] and covers his entire body except for his face. The suit is highly resistant to damage and extreme temperatures, and it is also equipped with two horns, designed to mimic the general shape and function of actual rhinoceros horns, capable of penetrating two-inch plate steel. His first suit, more crude in overall design, was originally bonded to his skin, and he was unable to remove it. This suit was eventually destroyed and a second, removable suit, more form-fitting in its design, was created by [[Justin Hammer]]. This suit was given to Rhino after he underwent additional gamma ray treatments that further heightened his powers. The new suit was also designed to enhance some of his powers, using gamma ray treatments.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Without the suit, Rhino still possesses great superhuman strength and is highly resistant to conventional physical injury, such as most high-caliber bullets, extreme temperatures and impact forces. While wearing the suit, his strength is slightly increased, while his durability is enhanced to a much more significant degree. The suit also allows him to withstand high-caliber bullets, exposure to temperature extremes of cold and heat without the suit cracking or melting or his own bodily tissues suffering damage, falls from great heights, light anti-tank weaponry, explosive concussions and potent acids without sustaining injury.

While lifting a makeshift dumbbell made out of a pole and two trucks, the second Rhino is called up by a mysterious person telling him where he can find Aleksei. Rhino attacks Aleksei at one of J. Jonah Jameson's press meetings. Aleksei lies to the second Rhino, agreeing to fight him in his suit but instead going into hiding with Oksana. However, before they arrive at their safehouse, the second Rhino attacks again and Oksana dies as a result.

==In other media==
{{long plot|section|date=August 2015}}

===Television===
* Rhino made two appearances in the first season of the 1967 ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon, voiced by [[Ed McNamara]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In the episode "Horn of the Rhino", Rhino steals some military equipment to try to make an explosive weapon which [[Spider-Man]] is blamed for, but Spider-Man realizes he is hiding in the rhinoceros enclosure of a zoo. Rhino is defeated with pepper and Spider-Man baking some mud with a heating device. In the episode "The Golden Rhino", Rhino steals a shipment of gold in order to make a gold statue of himself, which he succeeds in after stealing more gold, but is captured by Spider-Man's new webbing: instant steel. He later 'returned' in a third-season budget-saving 'mishmash' episode called "Rhino" which uses footage from his other episodes and where he also attempts to make another gold statue of himself, but is again webbed up.

[[File:The Rhino (Spider-Man, TAS).jpeg|thumb|right|Rhino as he appears in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* Rhino appears several times in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Don Stark]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} While his origin is not detailed in the series, he still retains his abilities from the comics. Here, he is shown as very unintelligent. First appearing in the episode "The Alien Costume" Pt. 1, he is hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to steal a mineral from [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]'s space shuttle after crash landing to Earth. Kingpin later sent Rhino to obtain another item where he fights Spider-Man in the black suit. Spider-Man fights the suit's urges to finish off Rhino. In the episode "The Alien Costume" Pt. 3, Spider-Man encounters Rhino on the rooftops and fights him where Rhino commented how he missed the black suit previously wore in their last encounter. Rhino was assisted in battle by [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] managing to bury Spider-Man in rubble. By the time Spider-Man emerges from the rubble, the web-slinger finds that Rhino and Shocker have been webbed up by [[Eddie Brock|Venom]]. In the episodes "The Insidious Six" and "Battle of the Insidious Six", Rhino later becomes a member of the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] after he, [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], [[Mysterio]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and Shocker are sprung from prison by Kingpin. As in one episode, Spider-Man easily fools him into thinking that he is Chameleon and tricks him into attacking the other Insidious Six members (because of this Rhino unintentionally damages Shocker's electrical suit). In the "Six Forgotten Warriors" episodes, Rhino was brought back together with the Insidious Six with Vulture acting as Mysterio's replacement. When looking for the keys for Red Skull's doomsday device, Rhino attacks Robert Frank and later, when it appears the villains are victorious, boasts he will soon be "the new Duke of Jersey" (in response to which Spider-Man mocks Rhino's lack of ambition).

The two friends had repeated run-ins with Spider-Man while growing frustrated at constantly being dupes and [[punching bag]]s. Concerned about Spider-Man's constant interference in his business, the Big Man had O'Hirn used as one of the guinea pigs in [[Norman Osborn]]'s illegal experiments, in which O'Hirn's body was infused with Dr. Otto Octavius's highly durable titanium resin armor modeled after a [[rhinoceros]]. Although he proves to be one of Spider-man's most physically powerful foes, the costume has a major weakness in that it obstructs his [[Sebaceous gland|pores]]. Now only able to perspire through his face, Rhino must periodically stop fighting and drink water, lest he overheat, a weakness Spider-Man utilizes to defeat him.{{episode needed|date=May 2014}} The costume also inhibits his ability to manipulate small objects such as [[elevator]] buttons.{{episode needed|date=May 2014}} The character appears in episodes such as "Group Therapy", "Reinforcement", "Accomplices" and "Opening Night".

Rhino continues to make appearances in further episodes (such as "Ant-Man", "Attack of the Synthezoids", "The Revenge of Arnim Zola" [Parts 1 & 2] and "Contest of Champions" [Part 4]).

* Rhino appears briefly in the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' video game, voiced by [[John DiMaggio]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The player briefly engages in a "Boss Battle" with him. This game's version of Rhino has spikes on parts of his costume and claws on his fingers. In the PC version of ''Spider-Man 2'', Rhino is the first villain Spider-Man battles in the game. In the first battle, Rhino escapes his maximum security prison after Spider-Man takes out numerous crooks. Later on in the game, Spider-Man and Rhino meet multiple times in Oscorp. In the PC Game, after Spider-Man defeats several crooks trying to make a jail break at the Maximum Security Prison in New York, Rhino breaks out and starts a fight with Spider-Man. Rhino then makes a run for it and is caught in a laser cage made by the police. Spider-Man engages Rhino in the cage and makes him smash into the cage until its power wears down. Rhino eventually gets through the cage completely after Spider-Man dodges him once more, but the villain is defeated when he rams a pole into a gas station that blows up and sends Rhino flying away from the blast. Rhino's unconscious body is taken by Doctor Octopus, leaving Spider-Man to take down the fire with fire hydrants. Rhino is later seen again in the game when Doctor Octopus attacks Oscorp, and Spider-Man has to fight Rhino in a generator room, defeating him by making him smash into six generators that electrocute him into submission.

Evading Rhino, Spider-Man destroys the tubes and escapes the room as it freezes leaving Rhino frozen in the chamber.
* The Ultimate Marvel version of Rhino is a boss Spider-Man fights in the 2005 ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' game, voiced by [[Bob Glouberman]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} When he first appeared, Spider-Man attempts to chase him while he causes destruction on the way. When he goes into a car lot, Spider-Man attempts to take him down by hitting him on his back multiple times. After Spider-Man defeated him, he was revealed to be a short man. He speaks mostly in Latin, seems to be very smart, and works for [[Bolivar Trask]] as his company made the R.H.I.N.O. armor. Strangely, this makes him the exact opposite of the original Rhino. In the characters page, R.H.I.N.O.'s name is shown to be Alex O'Hirn, and the web site for the game reveals that he originally designed the armor to be controlled by a computer before concluding that his own mind was more powerful than any computer and using the suit for himself.
* Rhino appears in the touch screen app ''Spider-Man: Total Mayhem''. He is a boss in the level: Rhino - serious rampage. He appears originally in level 1, where he throws a car at Spider-Man after he defeats Sandman (Flint Marko). The game appears to be set in the Ultimate universe, however, Rhino is less intelligent, suggesting a slightly different universe.
* Rhino appears as a mini-boss in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Steven Blum]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} He is a member of [[Doctor Doom]]'s [[Masters of Evil]]. He and [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] were first seen working with [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]. They are later seen guarding a defeated [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]]. Rhino has special dialogue with Thing and Venom. He is in the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'s simulation disk which takes place on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Omega Base where Thing must protect a frozen [[Mister Fantastic]].
* John DiMaggio reprises his role of Rhino in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]''. In the game, Rhino was one of the many villains that Mysterio kidnapped and placed under his control. He was sent to Tangaroa Island to guard a meteor shard. After Spider-Man defeats him and frees him of the Control Amulet, Rhino agrees to help Spider-Man and becomes a playable character.
* Steven Blum reprises his role of Rhino who appears in the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game. This version does not don a full costume, but rather a large part of his body is scaly and bumpy like that of a rhinoceros, while his mask resembles that of his traditional costume. [[Farley Stillwell|Dr. Stillwell]] forces [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] to free Rhino (who was caught by Spider-Man in the second game). Rhino accidentally knocks out Scorpion, and runs off. Observing the event, Spider-Man decides to look into MechaBioCon. Spider-Man allies with Scorpion to turn him back to normal. When Spider-Man and Scorpion reach Dr. Stillwell's hideout, Stillwell orders Rhino to destroy them. Rhino defeats Scorpion, but Spider-Man defeats Rhino by tying him up with web lines and dropping several enormous ceiling blocks on top of him, knocking him unconscious.
* Rhino appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Spider-Man encounters him on Ryker's Island when on his mission to break out the Tinkerer. Unlike his other incarnations, he actually aids Spider-Man (as he is needed to break certain obstacles in the level), though he still presents some danger because he will sometimes launch indiscriminate attacks that can hurt the enemies in the level and Spider-Man. With Rhino's help, Spider-Man manages to take down the security system which leads them to a lift leading out of Ryker's Island. If the player chooses the Red Suit path, Spider-Man tricks Rhino into going back the way they came in order to get himself captured again. If the player chooses the Black Suit Path, Spider-Man lets Rhino go through the exit and tells him to look for any flying super-powered characters stating to Rhino that he will need his help later. In the game's [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions, Rhino serves as a guard for [[Spencer Smythe]]'s underground laboratory. It was also mentioned that Kraven the Hunter was hunting Rhino.

This version of the character wears a massive rhino-like armor, which not only increases his strength, but is unable to remove. He fought and was defeated by Spider-Man several times in the past, just like [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. After Otto Octavius, now [[Doctor Octopus]], attacks Ryker's Island and the Raft, all four of them, as well as [[Mister Negative]], are freed and Otto recruits them to form the [[Sinister Six]], promising to fulfill each one's desires (with Rhino's wish being that of removing his armor). Spider-Man is easily defeated by the combined forces of the Sinister Six, but not killed because, as it is revealed at the end of the game, Otto is aware of his secret identity. The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Rhino and Scorpion being sent to poison the city's reservoir. Spider-Man stops them and they are later seen at the docks, fighting some [[Silver Sable|Sable]] International mercenaries and trying to destroy the medical deliveres for the people infected with Devil's Breath virus. [[Miles Morales]] encounters the two while there and manages to escape, warning Peter Parker about it. Spider-Man later arrives at the docks and manages to defeat Rhino and Scorpion, trapping them in a container until the police would take them back into custody.
