'''Ebony Maw''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a prominent member of the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], a team of aliens who work for the titan [[Thanos]].

Ebony Maw appears as one of the Children of Thanos in the film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), where he is portrayed by [[Tom Vaughan-Lawlor]].

==Publication history==
Ebony Maw first appears in a one panel cameo ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #8 (September [[2013 in comics|2013]]) and was created by [[Jonathan Hickman]] and [[Jerome Opeña]].<ref>https://www.cbr.com/exclusive-introducing-the-black-order-of-infinity-part-two/</ref> His second one panel appearance came later that month in ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' #1 (October 2013).

==Fictional character biography==
Ebony Maw was a member of [[Thanos]]' [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]]. He is not a fighter, but a dangerous thinker of the Black Order. When Thanos targeted [[Earth]] as the next planet he would raze during the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Ebony Maw was dispatched to deal with [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #8</ref>

Ebony Maw used his abilities to gain control over Doctor Strange and forced him to summon [[Shuma-Gorath]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> Then Ebony Maw used his abilities to have Doctor Strange serve as a double-agent for him when he reunited with the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]. When the Illuminati headed to numerous locations around the world to find Thanos' son Thane, Doctor Strange found the boy in a hidden [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] city of Orollan (which is located in [[Greenland]]). Ebony remained in the location and forced Doctor Strange to forget about the discovery and to leave where he is now freed from Maw's control.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #10</ref>

When [[Black Bolt]] detonated a Terrigen Bomb which unleashed the Terrigen Mists upon the entire face of Earth, Thanos' son Thane underwent Terrigenesis. The manifestation of his powers annihilated the entire town.<ref>''Infinity'' #4</ref> Posing as an ally following the incident, Ebony Maw offered Thane a suit to control his powers, but also captured him in a containment field followed by Ebony Maw alerting Thanos to the location of his son.<ref>''Infinity'' #5</ref> When the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] arrived in Orollan in order to defeat Thanos, Ebony Maw tested Thane by freeing him. Thane could escape or could fight Thanos and become what he had avoided his entire life. Thane agreed and embraced his true nature as the son of Thanos by fighting his father. Using the power of his right hand, Thane trapped Thanos and his ally [[Proxima Midnight]] in an amber construct which left them in a state of "living death." Upon the defeat of Thanos, Ebony Maw started disciplining Thane into becoming something greater than Thanos and greater than any one would.<ref>''Infinity'' #6</ref>

During the "No Surrender" arc, Ebony Maw appears as a member of [[Challenger (comics)|Challenger]]'s Black Order where he pits them in a contest against [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]'s [[Lethal Legion]].<ref>''Avengers'' #681. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ebony Maw has genius-level intellect. He mostly demonstrates his intelligence with his highly skilled abilities of manipulation being described as a "black tongue that spreads mischief and evil wherever he goes." Ebony Maw’s skills at manipulation are a result of his superhumanly persuasive voice which allows him to control even the strongest minds such as Doctor Strange.

He also uses technology that specializes in teleportation and force field generation.

While Cull is defeated, Maw leaves with Strange taking him aboard the Q-ship and tortures him in an attempt to have him give up the stone. However [[Tony Stark]] and [[Peter Parker]], who snuck aboard the ship, come to rescue Strange. After a brief confrontation, the two distract Maw and blast a hole on the side of the ship, causing an [[explosive decompression]] that blows Maw outside, leaving him to die in the vacuum of space.
