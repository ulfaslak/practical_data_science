'''Madman''' ('''Philip Sterns''') is a [[supervillain]] within the fictional [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The character is portrayed as one of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk's]] enemies and as the brother of [[Leader (comics)|Leader]].

==Publication history==
He first appeared as Philip Sterns in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #363 (December 1989) and as Madman in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #364 where they were created by [[Peter David]] and Jeff Purves.

==Fictional character biography==
A former schoolmate of Bruce Banner, Sterns develops a deranged love/obsession with Banner's "career" as the Hulk.  Sterns subjects himself to a multitude of experiments involving gamma-radiation to emulate his "hero." This results in Sterns turning into a distorted monstrosity with vast superhuman strength, and develops [[multiple personality disorder]]. From this point, a much stronger, arguably deranged, personality gives him ‘orders’ to carry out.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Calling himself Madman, Sterns hatches a plot to kill the Hulk, giving him a poison injection that rapidly deteriorates his physical state.{{issue|date=December 2012}} This puts the Hulk in conflict with various members of his rogues’ gallery, most notably the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], turning weaker and more emaciated for every battle. Samuel Sterns, the Leader and Phillip's brother, comes to the Hulk's aid and helps him track down Madman to find the antidote. He explains that Madman "scares him," but can’t force himself to kill his brother.{{issue|date=December 2012}} During the ensuing battle, Madman suffers a psychological breakdown, completely submerging his original personality, and Hulk manages to cure himself, as well as poison Madman, leaving the latter on the verge of death, with the remedy dropped barely out of reach.<ref name="IH367">''Incredible Hulk'' vol.2, #367</ref>

Later Madman reveals that he simply increased his mass to grab it, and used the time to masquerade as a researcher in the [[Red Skull]]'s "New World Order" organization. Here he helped to engineer the transformation of a captured [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent into the power-mimicking creature known as [[Piecemeal (Cyborg villain)|Piecemeal]], and installed a safety override, making it answerable only to himself.<ref name="IH408">''Incredible Hulk'' vol.2, #408</ref>

When tracking the creature, he finds it in confrontation with the Hulk in the vicinity of Loch Ness, and knocks out his enemy from behind. He dumps the Hulk into the lake saddled with iron weights, but is disappointed when the latter takes longer than expected to escape. During the ensuing gang-up, Madman continues to make disorderly, deranged remarks. When Perseus, a retired Pantheon member the Hulk was visiting, tries to intervene, Madman indifferently kills him, but the Hulk punches him away.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol.2, #407-#408</ref>

While the Hulk seemingly kills Piecemeal, Madman decides to take off in a stolen jet. The Hulk overtakes and starts to dismantle the jet, and Madman triggers a pilot-chair parachute, remarking that he's not interested in killing Hulk, since it would be dull to not annoy him anymore, and detonates the plane.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

After landing in London, where the two superhumans called Killpower and Motormouth happen to be staying, he immediately holds the British [[prince Charles]] hostage on top of [[Buckingham Palace]], and demands to be declared king of England. As Hulk comes to the rescue Madman states that the latter should understand the demands to use great power and shifts from crying to irreverently upbeat within seconds, dropping the prince towards the ground. The Hulk catches up to him, while Madman, after being knocked back by Motormouth, is in the middle of a temper tantrum about everybody "ganging up on him", and manages to knock him down. Madman once again voices his "love"/admiration for Hulk/Banner, but takes the opportunity to escape as the [[London Bridge]] collapses underneath them.<ref name="IH409">''Incredible Hulk'' vol.2, #409</ref>

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Madman resurfaces and has been seen supplying gamma technology on the island of Kata Jaya. He runs afoul of [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]]'s incarnation of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref name = "TB3">''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2 #3</ref> Madman was killed by Leader in his Red Leader form when he whispered something in his ear.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #6</ref>

After taking over Kata Jaya, the Leader makes a deal with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] that allows him to observe Madman being tortured in Hell. When Mephisto later takes the Leader to Hell, he notes that they need to "get his brother over here with some razor blades".<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Ben Acker and Ben Blacker|penciller = Kim Jacinto|inker = Kim Jacinto|colorist = Israel Silva|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

==Powers and abilities==
Like the Hulk, Madman has vast superhuman strength. Unlike the Hulk, Madman is unable to become stronger as he becomes angrier, but he is capable of creating significant boosts in his size, density and power, being able to reach at least twice of the "calm strength level" of most incarnations.<ref>''Hulk: The Incredible Guide'' (2003), by [[Tom DeFalco]]</ref> He once knocked out the Hulk with a single punch to the head through the advantage of surprise.<ref name="IH407">’’Incredible Hulk’’ vol.2, #407</ref> He has also claimed to be able to assume many different appearances, including the scientist spying on the "New World Order".<ref name="IH408"/>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Madman appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode "Hulk Vs. the World" as an inmate in the [[Cube (comics)|Cube]], a prison for gamma-powered villains.

===Video games===
* Madman appears as one of the major bosses in the ''[[Hulk (video game)|Hulk]]'' video game voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]. He works with his brother, The Leader to create a world ruled by gamma creatures (Freehold). Madman first appears kidnapping [[Betty Ross]], and putting her in a gamma chamber. The Hulk comes to rescue Betty and battle him. He returns near the end of the game, in the Leader's base, and teams up with [[Halflife (comics)|Halflife]] to kill Bruce Banner. However, Banner turns into the Hulk, and battles the duo. Madman flees in the middle of the boss fight, leaving Halflife at the mercy of the Hulk. When the base is collapsing, he tries to battle the Hulk one more time. He is presumably killed in the final fight after the Leader's base was destroyed as he was left behind.
