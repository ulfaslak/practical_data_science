==Fictional character biography==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=December 2018}}
Taskmaster is a mysterious figure believed to have been born in [[Brooklyn, New York City]]. He has the ability to mimic the physical movements of anyone he witnesses; writers differ on whether this counts as a "super power". He claims that he has had this ability since childhood. He works as a combat instructor and trains others to become lackeys for other villains by utilizing the techniques he has learned from his observation of superheroes and participates in mercenary jobs from time to time. Initially portrayed as a villain, he has also been shown training [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]] and other neophyte superheroes at the behest of the US government. As a mercenary, he has no ideology except that of his employer. Due to his ability to imitate the techniques and armory of other heroes and villains, Taskmaster has occasionally been used to impersonate other characters.

Tony Masters first demonstrated unusual abilities during childhood. After watching a cowboy show on television, he found himself able to duplicate the sophisticated rope tricks he had just watched the cowboy perform. Psychiatrists, called in at the mother's request, determined that the boy had a form of [[photographic memory]] which they called "photographic reflexes". He employed his power several times during his youth for personal gain, most notably when he became a star quarterback of his high school football team after watching one pro football game. Upon graduation, he briefly considered a career as a crime fighter, but opted instead to be a professional criminal, which he perceived to be far more lucrative.<ref name="Av196">''Avengers'' #196. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He then began a program of observing the fighting techniques of numerous costumed heroes and villains (using archival television news broadcasts). He initially used his fighting skills to execute several successful grand larcenies, but he had not properly anticipated the dangers involved. He decided to use his stolen capital to establish a center for training aspiring criminals to turn into polished professionals. His goal was to become a supplier for criminal organizations around the world.

Designing a costume with a white cowl and skull mask, he took the name "Taskmaster" and began to train many thugs at criminal academies he had located around the United States. However, his existence was eventually revealed when Pernell Solomon of the Solomon Institute for the Criminally Insane (a front for one of these academies) used the school's resources to create a clone of himself when the administrator required an organ donation due to possessing an extremely rare blood type; the clone (learning of this fate) managed to contact the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Taskmaster captured [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]], the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] when the Avengers invaded the premises;<ref>''Avengers'' #195. Marvel Comics.</ref> but the Avengers followed, exposing his front operation. Taskmaster held his own against [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Man]], however, was subsequently forced to flee after a confrontation with [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] since his lack of experience with Jocasta's abilities made it impossible to predict the robot's next move.<ref name="Av196"/> Taskmaster later established a new training academy in Manhattan, where he battled [[Spider-Man]] and Ant-Man, and then escaped.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #103. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later used a traveling carnival as a mobile base, where he battled [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and Ant-Man, and then escaped again.<ref>''Avengers'' #223. Marvel Comics.</ref> He next trained henchmen for the Black Abbott. Alongside Black Abbott, he battled Spider-Man and [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], and escaped yet again.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #146. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Deciding to further explore the use of a circus as a front for his academy, Taskmaster took over yet another small outfit, and used it for many months to great success. However, while it was playing a small town in Ohio, the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Vance Astrovik]] (who would later take the name Justice) assisted a government agent in foiling Taskmaster's activities. While escaping, Taskmaster was captured by a group of U.S. Secret Service agents and taken into custody.<ref>''The Thing'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> There is reason to believe that [[Red Skull]] was behind the Taskmaster's capture, since a group of normal men were able to capture him.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Through Douglas Rockwell (the head of the President's [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]]), Mr. Smith arranged for Taskmaster to train John Walker in order to make him appear to be the real Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #334. Marvel Comics.</ref> In order to conceal Red Skull's involvement, Rockwell had the Commission work out a deal to have years taken off Taskmaster's sentence in return for training Walker. After Taskmaster successfully trained Walker, Red Skull arranged for him to escape from the Commission's detention center so he could continue training lackeys and Red Skull himself.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Having escaped the authorities, he set up a base in a derelict graveyard in Brooklyn, where he battled Spider-Man and then escaped.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #308. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster then competed in a contest against [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], where he battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #292–293. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Taskmaster's more skilled, successful, and notable students include such characters as [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Cutthroat (comics)|Cutthroat]] (both Red Skull's henchmen), U.S. Agent, [[Hauptmann Deutschland]], [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] (Captain America's one-time girlfriend), [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]. On the other hand, Taskmaster also trains many of his students to serve as low-rent henchmen and cannon fodder. In his early appearances, Taskmaster mentions putting intellect-reducing drugs in the diet of his students. He also routinely sent groups of his more disappointing students to serve as "sparring partners" for Red Skull, routinely engaging several of them at a time and killing them all (Hauptmann Deutschland infiltrated the academy and used one such session as an opportunity to kidnap Red Skull). He has also employed other supervillains, such as when he hired [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]] as his academy's [[calisthenics]] instructor.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

On another occasion, Taskmaster was hired by the [[Triune Understanding]]—a religious group secretly masterminding a smear campaign to paint the Avengers as being religiously and racially intolerant—to stage an attack on a Triune facility. Posing as Captain America, he contacted [[Carol Danvers|Warbird]], Ant-Man, [[Silverclaw]] and [[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]], claiming that he needed their help to destroy a Triune building containing a mind-control machine. Although they saw through his deception and subsequently defeated him—thanks to Captain Marvel transforming into [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] mere milliseconds away from Taskmaster, thus causing a complete change of attack before Taskmaster could react—the building was destroyed in the ensuing battle and Taskmaster escaped, leaving the heroes lacking any evidence of their story.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Taskmaster continued to train numerous villains and thugs until the Avengers began to search out and shut down some of his academies across the United States. Taskmaster began to spend more time working as a mercenary in order to make up for the loss of profit. This led him to join [[Agency X]] at the behest of his love interest [[Sandi Brandenberg]], in missions from time to time, while continuing to teach at his academies around the world. More recently, Taskmaster is once again seen as a hired mercenary, contracted by the [[Committee (comics)|Committee]] to kill [[Moon Knight]] (Marc Spector). Taskmaster was misled with information that Moon Knight was broken, friendless and desiring death. During the conflict these factors all proved to be false as Marc's ex-girlfriend and butler came to Spector's defense and found the will to fight back. Despite his superior fighting abilities, Taskmaster was defeated. Moon Knight then carved off part of Taskmaster's facemask, though left him alive.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #3 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Taskmaster also worked at training henchmen to copy fighting styles of specific heroes. Taskmaster unleashed [[Death-Shield|Deathshield]] (trained to fight like Captain America), [[Jagged Bow]] (trained to fight like Hawkeye), and [[Blood Spider]] (trained to fight like Spider-Man) to face off against Spider-Man and Solo. The three were defeated, while Taskmaster escaped yet again.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #367">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #367. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" broke out, Taskmaster was hired by the government and enrolled into a team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and given temporary amnesty to take down the [[Secret Avengers]].<ref>''Civil War'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later battles the Secret Avengers in New York. He attempts to kill [[Invisible Woman|Susan "Sue" Storm]], only for [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] to take the bullet. Enraged, Sue crushes him with an invisible telekinetic field, rendering him unconscious.<ref>''Civil War'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was sent to the Negative Zone Prison with the other "Major-League" members of the Thunderbolts army such as [[Lady Deathstrike]],{{Issue|date=December 2009}} but was apparently freed by [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref> In order to regain his own reputation as a mercenary, Deadpool frees Taskmaster from his imprisonment to have a showdown with him while potential merc contractors watched from their captive position in a nearby prison. Taskmaster is again referred to as '''Tasky''' by Deadpool, and a fight ensues between him and the [[Handcuffs|manacled]] Deadpool. He mentions his professional ethics, but this simply comes down to deciding to simply maim his opponent rather than kill him. In the end, he is defeated by Deadpool who, in spite of the victory, fails to impress his captive audience. After being thanked for letting him win, Taskmaster tells Deadpool that he had not let him win, "The truth is... You're that good. You've always been that good. Which won't get you a cup of coffee until you figure out how to be a professional..."<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster was given a full presidential pardon for his efforts in testing the security of the [[Helicarrier|S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]], in which he was able to break in and place Deputy Director [[Maria Hill]] in his sights. Though he was allowed to leave, a threatening message left in Hill's private bathroom revealed that if he ever desired, infiltrating [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] would be no difficult feat.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}

Taskmaster replaces [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] as [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]]'s drill instructor and is tasked with training registered superheroes for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Fifty State Initiative]]. Taskmaster would also be involved in [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]]'s cloning process inputting (via technology) the original's move set for the [[Scarlet Spider]]s as well as the move set of Spider-Man.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Taskmaster is hired by Deadpool to help his old enemy and occasional friend defeat the Thunderbolts. Being disguised as Deadpool, he gets captured and is about to be beheaded when the real Deadpool saves him. Deadpool finally pays him, but he expresses annoyance at being paid from an ATM due to his major villain status.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 3 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Taskmaster is chosen to lead the Shadow Initiative after the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]], with their first mission to take down [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]]'s [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] cell in [[Madripoor]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Along with [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]], [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] and [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], Taskmaster stealthily leads the group into the country, but they are soon discovered by HYDRA.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Norman Osborn]] appoints Taskmaster to train criminals for the new Initiative, to behave like heroes. His first task is to retrain [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> Also, when [[Blastaar]] takes control of the [[Negative Zone]] prison 42, Taskmaster is ordered to lead a squad to take the prison back.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he gives [[Donyell Taylor|Night Thrasher]] a severe bullet wound to the head, allowing Osborn to take Night Thrasher prisoner.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref> When [[Emma Frost]] and [[Namor]] resign from the Cabal, Taskmaster is offered membership.<ref name="AV:TI31">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster was present at a meeting when Osborn discusses about Asgard.<ref>[[Brian Michael Bendis]] (w), [[Michael Lark]] (p), Stefano Gaudiano (i), ''Siege: The Cabal'' #1 (December 3, 2009), [[New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23928 |title=STORMING HEAVEN: "Siege: The Cabal" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] News |date=December 4, 2009 |accessdate=September 27, 2010 }}</ref> He is severely wounded at the meeting as a result of an attack by [[Doctor Doom]]. While recovering in a hospital, Taskmaster declined to join the Cabal. Osborn cut the oxygen tank next to Taskmaster's bed, reminding him that it was Osborn who plucked him from obscurity. Taskmaster then agrees to join in the [[Siege (comics)|siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref name="AV:TI31"/> During the battle, he fights with both versions of Captain America (Steve Rogers and [[Bucky Barnes]]).<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Asgard falls, Taskmaster finds Constrictor and the two beat a hasty retreat, but not before Taskmaster taunts Osborn about how Taskmaster helped Deadpool. After Osborn's defeat by Captain America and Iron Man, Taskmaster and Constrictor went back to mercenary work.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A false rumor is spread that Taskmaster is leaking information about the criminal underworld to Rogers's new 'heroic' regime. A bounty of $1,000,000,000 is placed on the Taskmaster's head by the mysterious Org. The hordes of AIM, HYDRA, the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]], [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]], the Cyber Ninjas, the Black Choppers, the Trenchcoat Mafia, the Legions of the Living Lightning, the Militiamen, the [[Sons of the Serpent]], and the Inquisition take up the chase to claim the money. Taskmaster, ambushed in a small diner, manages to best his opponents. But the diner's waitress, Mercedes Merced, gets entangled in the saga and is included in the bounty. Taskmaster reveals to Mercedes that his powers cause him to lose his explicit memory, meaning that he cannot remember anything about his personal life, and the only way for the whole ordeal to be over is to re-discover Taskmaster's origins.<ref name="Taskmaster2-1">''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster and Mercedes' quest takes them to Mexico to battle the [[Don of the Dead (comics)|Don of the Dead]],<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> and then to Bolivia to the village where everyone is Hitler. Inside an exact replica of Himmler's [[Wewelsburg]] Castle, Taskmaster regains his memories. He remembers being S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Tony Masters that had been sent to Bolivia to terminate Horst Gorscht, the Nazi scientist responsible for a corrupted version of the super-soldier serum. Gorscht had developed a new serum that could unlock the mind's potential to absorb knowledge instantaneously. With Gorscht's serum and test notes destroyed, Masters injected the last of the serum into himself. Having regained these memories, Taskmaster recognizes Mercedes' voice as being the same as 'The Hub', a mysterious voice who works for the Org. Taskmaster shoots Mercedes in the shoulder and threatens to kill her if she doesn't start talking. Mercedes reveals that the Org is a S.H.I.E.L.D. front, and that she is not only an agent, but also Taskmaster's wife. Miles above the Wewelsburg castle in an airship, the Minions' International Liberation Front (a secret group composed of henchmen from all of the major terrorist organizations), led by [[Redshirt (character)|Redshirt]] the Uber-Henchman, reveal their deception and plot to rule the criminal underground by using Taskmaster to lead them straight to the Org.<ref name="Taskmaster vol. 2 #3"/> Redshirt leads the Minions' International Liberation Front (or the acronym MILF for short) into battle against the Taskmaster and Mercedes. Mercedes convinces the Taskmaster to trust her and work together to fend off the forces of MILF. During the battle, Taskmaster regains his memories of Mercedes and how he fell in love with her. Before they can reconcile, Taskmaster is attacked from behind by Redshirt who has genetically altered his body and mastered superior fighting skills to those of Taskmaster. Redshirt gains the upper hand as the pair push each other to the limits. Mercedes tries to intervene to protect her husband, but is quickly and effortlessly cast to one side. Enraged, Taskmaster attacks Redshirt and delivers a killing blow using Redshirt's own fighting style (which causes Taskmaster to lose his memories once more). Taskmaster, not recognizing Mercedes or his reasons for being there, flees and leaves Mercedes alone once more.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

[[Avengers Academy]] student [[Finesse (comics)|Finesse]] later seeks out Taskmaster, thinking that he may be her long-lost father. When she finds Taskmaster, Finesse ends up sparring with him. After much sparring, Taskmaster finally relents to tell Finesse that he very well might be her father, but that the powers to learn so much about others’ movements and techniques have caused him to forget important things in life. Knowing he likely won’t remember the conversation in a couple days, Taskmaster tells Finesse that he wanted to fight her so he might remember her.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Taskmaster comes to the aid of [[Alpha Flight]] when it comes to forming a resistance against the Unity Party that was formed by [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In order for the [[Masters of Evil]] to obtain the Crown of Wolves for the [[Shadow Council]], Max Fury hired Taskmaster to retrieve it only for Taskmaster to demand more money for the job and he hid in the Hole. The Secret Avengers went to the Hole in order to get the Crown of Wolves before Fury got his hands on it. This led to a fight between Taskmaster and [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Taskmaster escaped and returned the crown to Fury, only for Max to apparently kill Taskmaster when he asks for payment. When the crown's effects don't function for Max, Taskmaster takes the crown for himself, which saves his life by making him the Avatar for the Abyss.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the Abyss spreads, the Secret Avengers members Venom and [[Eric O'Grady|Ant-Man]] are able to remove the crown and stop the spread, while Taskmaster and the Masters of Evil are left behind when the Avengers leave with Max in their custody.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #32–33. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The criminals of Bagalia imprison Taskmaster and are preparing to offer him up to the highest bidder. S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Secret Avengers come to rescue him and offer him a position. As their inside man, Taskmaster is part of the new High Council of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] as the Minister of Defense.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] later goes to A.I.M. Island to assist Taskmaster in helping make contact between the [[Iron Patriot]] A.I. drones and [[War Machine|James Rhodes]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the mission goes south and Mockingbird is left stranded on AIM Island,{{issue|date=December 2013}} Taskmaster works undercover to free her.{{issue|date=December 2013}} But when he gets the chance to get her off the island, she doesn't respond to anything he says until both are captured. While being interrogated, Taskmaster is shot and seemingly killed by Mockingbird apparently under the control of [[Andrew Forson|Scientist Supreme]] (Andrew Forson).<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, [[Mentallo]] discovered that Mockingbird purposely missed any vitals and Taskmaster survived.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At the time when Captain America was brainwashed into being a Hydra sleeper agent by Red Skull's clone using the powers of [[Kobik]], Taskmaster later relocated to Bagalia where he became its sheriff.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Taskmaster and Black Ant (Eric O'Grady's Life Model Decoy counterpart) found out what was done to Captain America to be made into a Hydra sleeper agent, they planned to have a parley with Maria Hill to discuss this with only for the new [[Madame Hydra]] (Elisa Sinclair) to get to them first.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> Impressed with the fighting skills of the two of them, Madame Hydra made them bodyguards.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Taskmaster appears as a member of Hydra's Avengers.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1. Marvel  Comics.</ref> During the battle in Washington DC, Taskmaster and Black Ant witness their teammate Odinson having enough of working for Hydra and striking them down. The two of them defect from Hydra and free the captive [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]]. When Taskmaster and Black Ant asks for them to put in a good word for them, [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]] webs them up anyway.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Taskmaster and Black Ant later attack [[Empire State University]] where [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] was teaching a class. As the inhibitor chip prevents Connors into turning into Lizard, Peter Parker sneaks off to become Spider-Man. During his fight with Black Ant and Taskmaster, Spider-Man is exposed to the Isotope Genome Accelerator that splits him from his Peter Parker side.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a prelude to "[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]", Taskmaster and Black Ant work with [[Kraven the Hunter]] and [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] in capturing some animal-themed characters for his upcoming hunt.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> Black Ant and Taskmaster are talking about the Hunt. Taskmaster betrays Black Ant saying that Black Ant is a animal-themed villain and tasers Black Ant to get more money.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Lizard finds Taskmaster at the Pop-Up with No Name. Lizard proceeds to poisons him by slipping a poison into her beer. Lizard offers Taskmaster the antidote if he can take Lizard to Central Park. While traveling there, Lizard and Taskmaster defeat Vermin, freeing innocent bystanders. Taskmaster helps put a taser chip in Lizard's body, and takes him to Arcade.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #19.HU. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster frees Lizard from his binds and Lizard tells Taskmaster that the poison will wear off in 24 hours.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #20.

As they leave, Taskmaster states that Black Ant would've done the same for him. When Black Ant asks "Do you mean the betrayal part or the rescue part?" All Taskmaster can say is "yeah!"<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Taskmaster injected himself with [[Hauptsturmführer|SS-Hauptsturmführer]] Horst Gorscht's primer, an elaborate modification of the adrenal steroid [[cortisol]] designed to unlock the mind's [[procedural memory]] potential. The Taskmaster thus gained the ability to absorb knowledge instantaneously. This ability is linked to his [[muscle memory]], allowing the Taskmaster to instantly replicate the physical movement of peak-level humans. Using these "photographic reflexes", the Taskmaster is highly skilled in various forms of combat, as an exceptional martial artist (mimicking [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Shang-Chi]]), a skilled swordsman ([[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], [[Silver Samurai]], [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]), a deadly accurate marksman ([[Captain America]] with a shield, [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] with a bow and arrow, [[Punisher]] with firearms, and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] with various projectiles) as well as displaying a strenuously honed athletic ability ([[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]). Once the Taskmaster has mastered an opponent's physical movements, he can then predict his opponent's next attack. The only person shown capable of negating Taskmaster's abilities is [[Deadpool]], whose manic personality makes him nearly impossible to predict.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 2 #2</ref> A side effect of the primer is severe [[declarative memory]] loss. The more implicit memories (i.e. knowledge and abilities) he learns, the more explicit memories (i.e. personal experience) he loses. Because of his explicit memory loss, the Org (Mercedes Merced) has acted as Taskmaster's surrogate memory, his banker, and his handler for his entire criminal career.<ref name="Taskmaster' 2011"/>

By viewing a video in fast-forward, the Taskmaster can learn to replicate human movement at near-superhuman speed. However, this puts his body under intense strain and can only be used for short periods of time. He also has the ability to manipulate his vocal cords to mimic the voices of others. The Taskmaster was once shown to have [[aquaphobia]] (the fear of water), but later overcame his fears.<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 1 #1–4 (2002)</ref>

===Weaponry===
As he is able to replicate numerous fighting techniques, the Taskmaster carries an extensive arsenal of weapons on his person, most commonly using a sword and a replica of Captain America's shield. He also carries a bow and a quiver of arrows, a billy club, a lasso, [[nunchaku]], throwing darts, and various firearms. The Taskmaster once used a stolen S.H.I.E.L.D. device that was able to create various forms of weaponry (such as arrows and shields) using solid energy.<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 1 #1 (2002)</ref>

==The Org (Mercedes Merced)==
The Org is the secret criminal underground that links all criminal and terrorist organizations. In reality, Mercedes Merced is the Taskmaster’s S.H.I.E.L.D. handler, posing as the Org and the Hub (the voice of the Org), to guide him through his memory loss and gather intelligence on the criminal underworld. Mercedes is also the Taskmaster's wife, having been happily married while they were both [[List of S.H.I.E.L.D. members|agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]] As a result of the Taskmaster's powers, his explicit memories of Mercedes were lost, and he had no recollection of being married.<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

When S.H.I.E.L.D. was shut down by [[Norman Osborn]], Mercedes went rogue and continued her role as her husband's handler. However, when a billion-dollar bounty was placed on the Taskmaster's head by someone claiming to be the Org, Mercedes was forced to break her cover and battle alongside her husband against Redshirt and the Minions' International Liberation Front. Once their enemies were beaten, and the Taskmaster once again forgot who she was, Mercedes mournfully returned to her previous role.<ref name="Taskmaster' 2011">''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #1–4 (2010–2011)</ref>
