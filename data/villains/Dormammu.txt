Debuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], Dormammu has appeared in six decades of Marvel publications, featuring prominently in the [[Doctor Strange]] titles and limited series as a recurring enemy of the [[mysticism|mystic]] hero. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including [[films]], [[animated]] [[television series]], [[toy]]s, [[trading cards]], and [[video games]].

==Publication history==
=== Origin ===
Dormammu first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126–127 (November – December 1964), but had been mentioned previously in dialog, along with his realm the "Dark Dimension".

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] said:

{{quote|text=To Lee and Steve Ditko, the Lord of the Realm of Darkness and the associated invocations were just another piece of business, another way of adding depth to the otherwordly nature of Strange's adventures. However, the readers were intrigued. They wanted to know more. "It seems there was something about that nutty name, Dormammu, that was keeping Doc's devoted disciples awake at nights trying to figure out who Dormammu was," Lee explained. "I knew I was in big trouble. I had made up the name—now I had to dream up a character to go with the name. But who? How?

Ditko visualized the answer. "He gave the demoniac DD...a visage totally different from any villain I had ever seen in comics before," proclaimed Lee.<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>}}

After being established as the ruler of an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]] (later described as the god-tyrant of its denizens),<ref>''Excalibur'' v.3, #14 (2005)</ref> Dormammu became a perennial foe of Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, who until this time had dealt almost exclusively with off-beat "one-off" mystical threats in ''Strange Tales'' #110–125 (July 1963 – October 1964). Strange's first encounter with Dormammu in the "Dark Dimension" also introduced [[Clea]], eventually revealed to be the niece of the villain (like Clea's name, this was not initially revealed in ''Strange Tales'' #126; November 1964), and the monstrous and imprisoned [[Mindless Ones]].

Major appearances include starring in an epic fifteen issue storyline in ''Strange Tales'' #131–146 (April 1965 – July 1966); the discovery that Dormammu has a sister, [[Umar (comics)|Umar]], and both are in fact mystical beings called ''Faltine'' in ''Strange Tales'' #150 (November 1966); teaming with fellow villain [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] to instigate the "Avengers-Defenders War" in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #115–118 (September – December 1973) and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #8–11 (September – December 1973); ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] '' Annual #9 (1981); ''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #1–2 (November 1988 & January 1989) and the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Doctor Strange: The Flight of the Bones'' #1–4 (February – May 1999) and ''[[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]]'' #1–3 (September – November 2000).

After a major appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #498–500 (October – December 2003), Dormammu became the patron of small-time villain the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #46 (December 2008).

== Fictional character biography ==

=== 1960s ===
Dormammu is first mentioned by [[Baron Mordo|Karl Amadeus Mordo]], senior apprentice of the appointed "Sorcerer Supreme" the "[[Ancient One]]", who, in the entity's service, attempts to slowly weaken the sorcerer, but is stopped when his fellow pupil [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]] alerts his master to the betrayal.<ref>{{Cite comic

The character later appears in person when sending a messenger to boast his renewed intentions of conquering his universe before his aging adversary. In response, Doctor Strange travels to Dormammu's "[[Dark Dimension (comics)|Dark Dimension]]" as the Ancient One does not consider himself powerful enough to defeat Dormammu, and manages to overcome all supernatural servitors sent against him. Dormammu engages Strange in mystic combat and shows himself to be far more powerful, but, when drawing upon the realm's energies, inadvertently weakens the barrier containing the horde of [[Mindless Ones]]. Since they threatened Dormammu's subjects, Strange helped his enemy to re-seal the juggernauts by letting power from his amulet flow into Dormammu. Indebted to Strange for his help, Dormammu ends the fight, and in return Strange demands a binding vow to never enter the "Earth realm" again and to not harm Clea. Dormammu complies, but gains a burning hatred against Strange for the humiliation.<ref>{{Cite comic

Dormammu uses a loophole to his oath by granting Mordo vast power, whereupon the sorcerer leads his minions on a lengthy hunt for Strange, and abduct the Ancient One as a bargaining chip. Dormammu's niece, [[Clea]], assists Strange by weakening the barrier of the Mindless Ones, forcing her uncle to focus elsewhere. Dormammu learns of her betrayal, brings all three Earth sorcerers to a neutral realm, to let her see his disciple destroy Strange, and summons fellow "Lords of the Netherworlds" to watch the spectacle. When Strange begins to get an advantage against Mordo, Dormammu decides to face the sorcerer in a contest of pure hand-to-hand-combat. The physically stronger entity eventually falls to his foe's greater familiarity with [[martial arts]]. To Dormammu's humiliation, before the gathered Lords, Strange forces him to vow not to menace the Earth even by proxy. The villain strikes a parting blow by banishing Clea, and inciting another lord to attack Strange.<ref name="Martial arts fight">{{Cite comic

Dormammu captures Clea, and overpowers and imprisons Strange. The sorcerer manipulates Umar into freeing him, and then surprises Dormammu by pushing him through a portal to the Earth.

The Eye is reassembled, and allows Dormammu to merge his own universe with all the planets of the "regular" Marvel Universe without breaking his vow. Dormammu imprisons the traitorous Loki and effortlessly overwhelms all of his other opponents, leaving only the [[Scarlet Witch]]. When Loki escapes and distracts Dormammu, the Scarlet Witch casts a hex on the Eye that causes it to absorb Dormammu, and costs Loki his sanity.<ref name="Avengers/Defenders War">"Avengers/Defenders War" from:

Dormammu's agent Baron Mordo travels back in time to [[London]] in the year 1943, where he allies with the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] Viscount Krowler and Sir Anthony Baskerville.

The character reappears during the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" storyline. Strange, following an arduous confrontation with [[Shuma-Gorath]], heals through a process that takes him through various mystical realms. This allows Dormammu to attach himself to his foe, and possess the sorcerer’s body, which exempts him from the vow to not directly enter the Earth-realm. Summoning extraterrestrial sorcerers as his lieutenants, Dormammu vows to "burn" and replace the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] as the greatest power in the Earth's universe, but is distracted and tricked by Clea and Strange (his consciousness occupying a [[rat]]), while their ally [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] exorcises Dormammu’s presence.<ref name="Celestials">{{Cite comic

The character reconstitutes again, regains control of the Dark Dimension from Clea by subverting her will, and summons her parents, Umar and Orini, from exile. Umar and Baron Mordo join forces with Clea and Doctor Strange. The enraged Dormammu threatens to completely destroy the "Dark Dimension" in retaliation, but Umar convinces him to accept a compromise as the ruler of a sub-realm, whereas his sister takes over rulership from Clea, with Mordo as her consort. Clea agrees to abdicate rather than see all of her people killed, but promises to return if Umar becomes a tyrant again. Dormammu finds that he has been tricked into becoming the ruler of the realm of the Mindless Ones.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer= Roy Thomas; [[Dann Thomas]]| penciller= [[Jackson Guice]]  | inker= [[Tony Dezuniga]]; [[Mark McKenna]]| story= The Dark Wars  | title= Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme  | volume= 1  | issue= 21-24| date= October - December 1990| publisher= Marvel Comics}}</ref>

This frees Dormammu to reclaim his realm. He absorbs Umar and Mordo into himself, becoming more powerful than ever before, and he disintegrates the assembled entities.

Strange, at the time weakened without support from the "Principalities", confronts Dormammu with his allies Clea, the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Hulk]], and [[Ghost Rider]], but they are unable to cause any injury to the villain. Strange journeys into the core of Dormammu's essence and uses the [[Eye of Agamotto]] to strip away his self-delusion, and make him acknowledge that his thirst for chaos, power, and conquest are unworthy of a being of his stature. Dormammu is momentarily shaken, and appears to be defeated, but this is only a mirage. The villain gloats that he has not shown "one tenth" of his true power against the heroes, but that he now realizes that rulership of "one puny" universe is beneath his notice, as he now has far greater and "more interesting" ambitions, and contemptuously dismisses the "insignificant mortals".<ref name="SecretDefenders">{{Cite comic| writer= [[Len Kamanski]] <!--   | artist= Geof Isherwood -->  | story= The Heart of Darkness  | title= Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme  | volume= 1  | issue= 48-50  | date= December 1992 - February 1993  | publisher= Marvel Comics  | page=   | panel= }}</ref>

The character observes the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] – adventurers from the [[31st century]] of [[Earth-691]] – travel to the mainstream era of [[Earth-616]]. Dormammu follows them back to their dimension, merges with his counterpart in this timeline, doubling his power, and attacks their headquarters, demanding the presence of the Doctor Strange of their time. Strange, now called the Ancient One, arrives with his disciple, the alien [[Krugarr]], and battles Dormammu, assisted by the Guardians, the "Galactic Guardians", and the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. Dormammu kills the elderly Strange, and almost overwhelms his other foes, but is defeated when Krugarr summons the spirit of Strange, and they channel the combined power of everyone in the assembly to banish Dormammu to his home dimension.<ref name="GotG">{{Cite comic  | writer= [[Michael Gallagher (writer)|Michael Gallagher]]<!--   | penciller= [[Kevin West]]  | inker= [[Steve Montano]] -->  | story=   | title= Guardians of the Galaxy  | volume= 1  | issue= 34-36  | date= March - May 1993  | publisher= Marvel Comics  | page=   | panel= }}</ref>

Doctor Strange engages Dormammu in combat, and sends the hero [[Spider-Man]] back in time to a critical moment to stop his enemy from being able to re-enter Earth's universe, Spider-Man warning the heroes to delay in their attempts to stop the Mindless Ones long enough for the younger Strange to show up and banish them himself.<ref>The Spider-Man story "Happy Birthday" from:

Dormammu returns, now in a symbiotic link with Umar. Together they petition the "''Pan-dimensional Oversight Council''" (counting Strange and [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] among its members) to perform a [[preemptive strike]] against Earth's superhumans, as "potential [[weapons of mass-destruction]]", and when the petition fails, Dormammu eats most of the present council-members, whereas Umar reduces the rest to "screaming blobs of mindless jelly".  The siblings then attack and overcome the entity Eternity, and use the acquired power to remake all universes in their hellish image. The pair are opposed by a reuniting of some of the original Defenders (Strange; the Hulk; and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]]), with Dormammu retreating when Umar steals his power.<ref name="DeMatteis&Giffen">{{Cite comic

==Character==
Dormammu has been described as "something worse than a demon".<ref name="Hood"/> It is unknown exactly how ancient he is, as he inhabits a wholly alien realm, separate from the rest of the [[Marvel Universe]], that defies the laws of physics as understood on Earth. He is known to have already existed at the creation of the current demonic netherworlds;<ref name="hellcat"/> to have clashed with [[Agamotto]] hundreds of millions of years ago; to have served as the primary enemy of the [[Vishanti]] ever since; and to have been considered an extreme threat by the mages of "[[Kull of Atlantis|pre-cataclysm]]" [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]].<ref name="Marvel Zombies"/>

Dormammu is presented as the most powerful and malevolent of "the Faltine",<ref name="SecretDefenders"/> fictional [[n-dimensional space|higher-dimensional]] mystical energy beings. Not native to the "Dark Dimension", Dormammu and "his" sibling Umar were exiled for slaying their progenitor "Sinifer" and for their morbid/unclean obsession with physical matter. They journeyed to the Dark Dimension in search of experience, and assumed corporeal forms.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol.3, #22 (October 1990)</ref> Dormammu merged with the local "Flames of Regency" to further enhance his power, and returned to an energy state, whereas Umar had grown accustomed to physical pleasure. After imprisoning the horde of marauding virtually unstoppable [[Mindless Ones]], Dormammu enslaved the entire realm and demanded worship as its sole deity. He continued to gradually merge other mystical universes to his own, while spreading his worship to any sorcerers throughout the multiverse who invoked his powers.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol.2 #72</ref>

The character is sometimes shown as incredibly patient, with certain plots to achieve his goals spanning billions of years,<ref name="hellcat"/> whereas others are planned far more recently or even improvised through opportunity.<ref name="SecretDefenders"/> Although extremely intelligent, with tremendous knowledge of the mystic arts, he is overwhelmingly arrogant, generally does not adapt well to sudden confusion and unexpected developments,<ref name="GotG"/> and has a tendency to gloat over technically outmatched foes rather than swiftly finish them off.<ref name="Martial arts fight"/><ref name="Avengers/Defenders War"/><ref name="SecretDefenders"/><ref name="DoctorVoodoo">''Doctor Voodoo: Avenger of the Supernatural'' #1 (2010)</ref> What makes Dormammu different from other prominent Marvel supervillains is that he has been shown as fully capable of personally defeating cosmic entities, even without external power sources and outside of the "Dark Dimension".<ref name="GotG"/><ref name="DeMatteis&Giffen"/>

Originally genderless siblings, Dormammu and his sister Umar have an unpredictable love-hate relationship. Sometimes loyal and collaborative, other times they gladly betray each other or take the other's power for themselves.<ref name="SecretDefenders"/><ref name="DeMatteis&Giffen"/> Umar has an occasional tendency to sarcastically puncture her brother's obsessive histrionics with more pragmatic sadistic hedonism.<ref name="DeMatteis&Giffen"/>

Writer [[Keith Giffen]] has described them as "Donnie and Marie from hell. The brother-sister sibling rivalry relationship blown up to nightmarish, universe-shattering proportions." Nevertheless, Dormammu is "completely inhuman",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=37585 |title=Giffen & Dematteis Talk Defenders And A Little Bit Of Everything |publisher=Google.se |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> the kind of character that "commits mass murder... on a whim".<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=34406 |title=Defending Drax With Keith Giffen |publisher=Google.se |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12}}</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* Dormammu appears in the 1979 ''[[Spider-Woman (TV series)|Spider-Woman]]'' episode "Realm of Darkness". This version bears little relation to his comic book look aside from the flaming head. He is summoned to Earth by worshipers from [[Grand Cayman Island]]. He plans to stop the [[Moon]] in its orbit when the eclipse occurs so that he can engulf Earth in complete darkness.
* Dormammu appears in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series' episodes "Doctor Strange", "Venom Returns", and "Carnage", voiced by [[Ed Gilbert]]. In this series, he uses his servant Baron Mordo to try freeing himself. Knowing that the Venom symbiote was due to reproduce and create a new symbiote, Dormammu had Mordo send the rocket it was on back to earth. Using the newly formed Carnage, Dormammu collected humans souls equal to his own and switched places with them. However, Spidey and Venom manage to reverse the process, sealing Dormammu, Carnage and Venom back into "hot head's" home dimension.
*Dormammu appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "Enter: Dormammu", voiced by [[Robert Englund]]. Doctor Strange (whose Eye of Agamotto is holding an Infinity Sword fractal) ends up unleashing Dormammu from his Dark Dimension into Super Hero City. A recurring gag during this episode was Falcon asking Dormammu if he knows that his head is on fire. When Dormammu unleashes his Mindless Ones upon Super Hero City, Dormammu manages to steal the fractals from the Vault and Villainville while taking Captain America and Doctor Doom hostage. When the fractal is extracted from the Eye of Agamotto, Doctor Strange then uses a spell to banish Dormammu back into the Dark Dimension. In "This Al Dente Earth", Doctor Strange briefly pulls Dormammu's head out of the Dark Dimension in order to damage Galactus' machine.

Dormammu's skill with intangibility is featured in this episode. In the episode "The Moon Knight Before Christmas," it was revealed in a flashback that Mysterio made a deal with Dormammu to enhance his illusion abilities where the side-effect ended up trapping Mysterio in his helmet upon his defeat until the day when Spider-Man freed him and his daughter Frances Beck.
* Dormammu appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episodes "Widow's Run" and "Into the Dark Dimension", voiced again by Phil LaMarr.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Into the Dark Dimension|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=7|airdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref> Due to the effects that the [[Infinity Gems]] are having on reality, Dormammu and the Mindless Ones emerge from a portal to the Dark Dimension causing the Avengers and Doctor Strange to fight them.
