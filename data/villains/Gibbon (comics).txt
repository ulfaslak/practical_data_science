==Fictional character biography==

===Martin Blank===
Martin Blank is a man who was seemingly born a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with an [[ape]]-like build and agility. Gibbon later joins a [[circus]] where he does well as an [[acrobatics|acrobat]]. His powers are later enhanced by a potion given to him by [[Kraven the Hunter]] to "Unleash the Beast Within". Martin Blank begins his career as a friend of Spider-Man's while wearing a [[gibbon]] suit. He even wants to be his partner, but Spider-Man laughs at him.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #110</ref> Sick of being seen as a freak, Martin cannot take further ridicule and lashes out. He then catches the eye of Kraven the Hunter who enhances the Gibbon's powers with a herb broth, also giving him a great animal rage. After Spider-Man defeats him,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #111</ref> Martin is not seen for a while.

Gibbon was one of the inmates at Ryker's Island.<ref>''Spider-Man's Tangled Web'' #4-5</ref> Gibbon sought revenge on Spider-Man, trying to prove himself as good as his foe. He is caught in the middle of a fight with Spider-Man and the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]]. Eventually Gibbon helps Spider-Man by punching out the Beetle.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} Gibbon later joins up with other has-beens: the [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]], [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], and the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] to form the [[Legion of Losers]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol.2 #245</ref>

This team falls apart when Spider-Man carted the Spot and the Kangaroo to jail for [[bank robbery]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol.2 #246</ref> He and the Grizzly would later attempt to go hero, helping Spider-Man thwart a bank robbery by the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]] and eventually getting an [[action figure]] deal.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #253</ref><ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #256</ref>

The Gibbon has been shown as retaining his physical mutation, but showed no sign of his former mutant abilities.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Gibbon is seen as a client for the law offices that employ She-Hulk. He steals her tuna melt lunch out of the fridge.<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #6</ref>

Following the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, the Gibbon is a self-confessed loser at the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] of [[Stilt-Man]]. Almost all of the supervillains at the wake are the victims of murder/attempted murder. The [[Punisher]], disguised as a barman, poisons drinks and then blows up the bar.<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #4 (2007)</ref> It is later mentioned that "they all had to get their [[Gastric lavage|stomachs pumped]] and be treated for [[Burn (injury)|third-degree burns]]."<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #17</ref>

Martin is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program.<ref name="civilwarbattledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

Martin, nearly hairless, has spent his time since the bar attack plotting vengeance on the Punisher against the wishes of Martin's wife [[Princess Python]] (who was apparently blinded in the explosion). When Martin finds the Punisher, however, he decides his revenge is not worth throwing away his life, and hands his gun over to the Punisher, returning home.<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #16 (2007)</ref>

Gibbon returns as the lead character in the ''[[Marvel Apes]]'' storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=154341 |title=NYCC '08: Marvel Apes |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=April 20, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><blockquote>The Gibbon wasn’t the perfect choice just because he’s a mainstream Marvel character who can easily "pass" in an ape-filled monkeyverse, but because he’s such a lovable loser. Nothing ever goes right for him— he never gets a break, the girl, or the glory— and suddenly he finds the fate of an entire universe in his hands. In some ways, ''Marvel Apes'' is a sprawling epic like [[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]], and the Gibbon is our [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]— one small person dwarfed by the overwhelming forces that stand between him and his goal. He even has his own [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]]— a spunky gal-scientist (human) named Fiona Fitzhugh who literally gets sucked into this adventure along with him.</blockquote>

Gibbon, apparently restored to his simian appearance with the related abilities, is left with his personal life in shambles. His attempts to side with the heroes are frustrated by his ineptitude, and even Princess Python, previously a caring and loving wife, has now become fed up with the meek loser Gibbon is reverting to. Out of boredom and depression, he replies to an ad posted on the ''Daily Bugle'' by Fiona Fitzhugh, a spunky and cheery young scientist hoping to study the nature of superpowered individuals. Her experiments fling both of them into a reality populated by simian version of the Marvel Heroes, and destroy the machines that could have been used to bring Gibbon back. Fiona supposes, due to Gibbon having his powers since birth, instead of gaining them in puberty as the majority of the mutants (thus making Gibbon more similar to mutants like [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]), and being "drawn" to that particular reality, that Gibbon may be connected somehow to the Simian World.<ref>''[[Marvel Apes]]'' #1</ref>

While Fiona asks for help from the simian version of the Fantastic Four, Gibbon is inducted by Spider-Monkey into the Ape-Vengers. Despite their friendly facade, the Ape-Vengers are far more ruthless and bestial than their human counterparts. The Gibbon sets out to discover the truth, with the help of a cadre of dissident simian heroes: the Ape-Vengers are under the thrall of [[Baron Blood (comics)|Baron Blood]], who in this reality stole the appearance and the powers of Captain America, using his influence to prey over villains' and dissidents' blood at his leisure.<ref>''Marvel Apes'' #2</ref>

Along with [[Speedball (comics)|Speedball]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], despite being now pursued by Baron Blood and his followers, Gibbon manages to free Captain America from the iceberg in which he was entombed since the 1940s, gaining his help in battling the impersonator.<ref>''Marvel Apes'' #3</ref> Eventually he and Fiona make their way back home.<ref>''Marvel Apes'' #4</ref>

Later, he travels with [[Gorilla Girl]], Fiona, and several other allies as [[Norman Osborn]] seeks to exploit the potential of the now somewhat-accessible 'ape' universe.{{issue|date=September 2013}} Fiona works to provide the Gibbon with various means of disguise to hide his simian nature.{{issue|date=September 2013}}

Gibbon later appears as a member of the Hateful Hexad alongside Bearboarguy, [[Ox (comics)|Ox]], [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]. During the Hateful Hexad's disastrous fight against Spider-Man and [[Deadpool]], the battle is crashed by Itsy Bitsy who stabs Gibbon.<ref>''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #9</ref>

===Unnamed criminal===
Martin Blank later sold his costume to [[Roderick Kingsley]] who gave it to an unnamed criminal. Gibbon was present with [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] (who was actually Roderick Kingsley's butler Claude) when he led his forces into fighting the Goblin King's Goblin Nation. After Hobgoblin was killed by Goblin King, Gibbon was among the villains that defected to the Goblin Nation.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' #26</ref>

Gibbon was seen with the other former Hobgoblin minions at the Bar with No Name where they encounter [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Blank has a gibbon-like appearance, with superhuman strength, speed, agility, dexterity, reflexes, coordination, balance and endurance. He had previously worn a gibbon suit during his career.
