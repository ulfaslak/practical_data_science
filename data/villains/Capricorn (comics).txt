'''Willard Weir''' is a founding member of the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] criminal cartel, and his base of operations was [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The Zodiac Cartel was founded by [[Taurus (comics)|Cornelius van Lunt]] (Taurus), handpicking the eleven other members; van Lunt concealed his own identity, while he was the only one who knew the identities of the others. Each member was based in a different American city as part of his nationwide criminal network, with the ultimate goal of world economic and political domination.

The Zodiac was infiltrated by Nick Fury, posing as Scorpio; the Zodiac fought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and escaped.<ref>''Avengers'' #72</ref> Aquarius, Capricorn, and Sagittarius sought to recapture the Zodiac Key, but lost it to the Brotherhood of the Ankh.<ref>''Iron Man'' #35-36; ''Daredevil'' #73</ref>

Led by Taurus, the Zodiac later attempted to kill all Manhattan residents born under the sign of Gemini as a show of power, but were thwarted by the Avengers. Taurus's faction attempted to kill the Zodiac dissident faction, but all twelve leaders were captured by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #120-122</ref>

A new android version of the Zodiac later appeared, led by Scorpio in a new android body, massacred the human Zodiac, and took over their criminal operations.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #26</ref>

===Android Capricorn===
An android Capricorn was a [[Life Model Decoy]] created by [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio (Jacob Fury)]] in his "Theatre Of Genetics" to be part of his Zodiac crime organization. The first Capricorn and [[Pisces (comics)|Pisces]] androids, however, died due to imperfections soon after their activation.<ref>''Defenders'' #48-50</ref>

After the "death" of the first Capricorn LMD, Scorpio created a second version of the Capricorn LMD. The Zodiac LMD's were recruited by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] during his bout with temporary insanity, and Quicksilver ordered the Zodiac LMD's to destroy [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for their imagined wrongdoings. The Avengers managed to defeat the group and most were remanded into federal custody.<ref>''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #1</ref>

The android Zodiac were soon released, and the Scorpio LMD rebuilt a number of them. Scorpio used the Zodiac Key to create LMDs that exemplified the forces and personalities inherent in each sign, hoping to create great strength in the combination of all twelve traits of the Zodiac. She arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]]. Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. In their initial foray, the Avengers failed, although several androids were destroyed.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #26-28</ref>

The Zodiac Key immediately resurrected the Scorpio LMD. Claiming superiority and believing that the Zodiac would eventually kill the Avengers as the androids could never be stopped, Scorpio wanted to use the Key to transport everyone on the scene to the Key's native dimension where the conflict, he believed, could be prolonged indefinitely. However, when the androids were in the other dimension, they ceased to function because each of them were aligned with a particular zodiacal energy, energy that did not exist in the other dimension. The Avengers found [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Tigra]] had been sent to the same dimension and, reunited, the team was sent back to Earth by the Brotherhood.

===Thanos' Zodiac===
The fourth Capricorn is an unnamed man who [[Thanos]] recruited to join his incarnation of the Zodiac.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> He and the other Zodiac members perish when Thanos abandons them on the self-destructing Helicarrier where [[John King (comics)|Cancer]] was the only survivor.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' Vol. 2 #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Capricorn dresses in a goat-like costume. Through unknown means, Capricorn can cause his costume's horns to extend, wrap themselves around opponents, and throw the opponents about. He was also an expert in karate and sometimes carried a hand-held blaster.

The android Capricorn had goat-like horns and demonstrated no abilities. In its second form, Capricorn is an expert climber and has a set of wings that allow her to soar. She has a set of hooves which she can use as a weapon. This form was later modified into a hairy female form which retained the climbing ability and gained powerful hooves.

Ecliptic's Capricorn possessed superhuman strength, uses its horns to attack, wields a gun, and possesses the Zodiac's teleportation device.

==In other media==

* Capricorn (alongside the other Zodiac members) appears in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]''. He is depicted as a goat-horned green-skinned alien that wields a flail in battle.
