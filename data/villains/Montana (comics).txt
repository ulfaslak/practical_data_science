==Fictional character biography==
Jackson Brice was born in [[Bozeman, Montana]]. Along with [[Fancy Dan]] (Daniel Brito) and [[Ox (comics)|Ox]] (Raymond Bloch), he was a founding member of the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]].{{Issue|date=January 2011}} He has great proficiency with the [[lasso|lariat]].

Montana, Fancy Dan and Ox make their first appearance under the employ of the [[Big Man (comics)|Big Man]] ([[Frederick Foswell]]). During this time, they have their first run-in with their longtime nemesis [[Spider-Man]]. During their first fight against the web-slinger, Montana's lasso skills initially prove successful but Spider-Man defeats the trio.<ref>{{cite comic| writer = [[Stan Lee]]| artist = [[Steve Ditko]]| colorist = | letterer = | editor = | story = The Enforcers!| title = [[The Amazing Spider-Man]]| volume = 1| issue = 10| date = March 1964| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

Over the next couple of years, Montana and the team would be employed by [[Lightmaster]] in one of his many schemes, again bringing them into conflict with Spider-Man, with similar results.{{Issue|date=May 2011}} They would then lend their services to Tech-Master in his revenge plot against Harry S. Osgood, only to be defeated by [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]].{{Issue|date=May 2011}} Montana and the team would also go up against [[She-Hulk]] at one point.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

Following the 2006 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, Montana, [[Ox (comics)|Ox]] (Ronald Bloch) and Fancy Dan reunite to work for [[Mister Fear]], which pits them directly against [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].{{Issue|date=January 2011}} After Mister Fear's arrest, the Enforcers are taken in by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s organization.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Following the events of the 2008 "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day]]" storyline, the Enforcers are patrons at the Bar With No Name. They take bets with a person calling himself "The Bookie", over whether Spider-Man will show up to battle "Basher", an unknown villain who claimed to have fought Spider-Man. Spider-Man shows up, but is revealed to be [[Screwball (comics)|Screwball]] in disguise when the real web-head shows up. The Enforcers decide to get revenge on The Bookie, capturing him. The Bookie's father calls Spider-Man for assistance, and he agrees to help. Spider-Man defeats Fancy Dan and Montana.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #562. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the story arc "Kill To Be You", Montana is the right-hand man of the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] (Wilson Fisk), and shows contempt toward the [[Phil Urich|Hobgoblin]] (Phil Urich). When Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] come to steal back the Reverbium, Montana falls out a window to his death while Hobgoblin saves Kingpin. Hobgoblin cruelly joked that "he'll be missed by everyone – except the pavement".<ref>{{cite comic| writer = [[Dan Slott]]| | penciller = [[Humberto Ramos]]| inker = Carlos Cuevas, Joseph Damon| colorist = | letterer = | editor = | story = Big Time (part 4) | title = [[The Amazing Spider-Man]]| volume = 1| issue = 651| date = March 2011| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

During the 2016 - 2017 "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline, Montana is among the cloned villains by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]]'s company New U Technologies.<ref>{{cite comic| writer = [[Dan Slott]]| | penciller = [[Jim Cheung]]| inker = John Dell| colorist = | letterer = | editor = | story = | title = [[Clone Conspiracy]]| volume = 1| issue = 2| date = January 2017| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref> He is involved in a fight with the other cloned supervillains until it is broken up by the clone of the [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer = [[Sean Ryan (comics)|Sean Ryan]]| | penciller = Javier Saltares, Jamal Campbell| inker = Jamal Campbell | colorist = | letterer = | editor = | story = | title = [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]]| volume = 2| issue = 1| date = December 2016| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

In the future timeline of the 1999 ''[[Earth X]]'' miniseries, Montana had mutated where he developed the ability to change his hands into lassos. He and his fellow Enforcers would be hired as heavies to protect President [[Norman Osborn]]. This protection proved to be ineffectual when the Skull came to New York to take over America. He took control of Montana and the others and then murdered Osborn. Montana's fate following the defeat of the Skull remain unrevealed.<ref>''Earth X'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''Spider-Man Noir'', Montana and the other Enforcers are muscle for crime boss known as the Goblin.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Enforcers attack Spider-Man while he is busy trying to save [[Norman Osborn]] from [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], but both them and Vulture are ultimately defeated by the web-slinger and arrested by the police, though Montana is the only one to escape, and returns in subsequent episodes.<ref>{{Cite episode |title = Market Forces |episodelink = Market Forces (The Spectacular Spider-Man)|url = |series = The Spectacular Spider-Man |serieslink = The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|credits = |network = |station = |city = |airdate = |began = |ended = |season = |seriesno = |number = |minutes = |transcript = |transcripturl = |quote = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title = Group Therapy |episodelink = |url = |series = The Spectacular Spider-Man |serieslink = The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|credits = |network = |station = |city = |airdate = |began = |ended = |season = |seriesno = |number = |minutes = |transcript = |transcripturl = |quote = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title = Probable Cause |episodelink = |url = |series = The Spectacular Spider-Man |serieslink = The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|credits = |network = |station = |city = |airdate = |began = |ended = |season = |seriesno = |number = |minutes = |transcript = |transcripturl = |quote = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title = Opening Night |episodelink = |url = |series = The Spectacular Spider-Man |serieslink = The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|credits = |network = |station = |city = |airdate = |began = |ended = |season = |seriesno = |number = |minutes = |transcript = |transcripturl = |quote = }}</ref><ref>http://s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/latest.php</ref> Montana becomes Shocker in the episode "[[Market Forces (The Spectacular Spider-Man)|Market Forces]]", donning a high tech costume equipped with gauntlents that emit vibro-blasts, which he and the Enforcers have just stolen from a Tri-Corp truck. Hammerhead enlists Shocker to complete his contract for the Big Man to kill Spider-Man, and he uses two small-time criminals named [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Flint Marko]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Alex O'Hirn]], who are also working for the Big Man, to lure Spider-Man to him at a [[landfill]], where the two have a brief battle, before Shocker easily defeats Spider-Man and knocks him into a garbage crushing machine. Later, Spider-Man tracks down Marko and O'Hirn again and tells them to inform Shocker that he wants a rematch. Shocker lures Spider-Man to an abandoned theater, where the two have another battle and this time Spider-Man emerges victorious, tricking Shocker to bring down the building on himself and leaving him to be arrested by the police. In the episode "Group Therapy", Shocker joins [[Doctor Octopus]]' [[Sinister Six]] alongside [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], Vulture, Sandman, and Rhino, to get revenge of Spider-Man. They and the Enforcers are all broken out of Ryker's Island by Electro and Hammerhead, who leaves with Ox and Fancy Dan, while Shocker goes with the rest of the Sinister Six. The team almost succeeds in killing Spider-Man the first time, but he escapes and they are all ultimately defeated by a [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]-possessed Spider-Man during their second battle, and subsequently returned to custody. Shocker is the only villain from the original incarnation of the Sinister Six not to return in the new version of the team from the second season (which now includes [[Mysterio]] and [[Kraven the Hunter]], as well as the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]] as the team's supervisor), most likely because he has returned working for the Big Man, who, by the time of the second season, has become a rival to Doctor Octopus for control over the city's criminal underworld; despite this, Shocker is still mentioned in the episode "Reinforcement" by Spider-Man, who is unaware that he isn't a member of the Sinister Six anymore, and Mysterio even uses a hologram of Shocker to trick Spider-Man during the battle between the web-slinger and the new Sinister Six. In the episode "Probable Cause", the Enforcers are hired by the Big Man to rob the Metro Bank; to help them succeed with this task, the Big Man has the Tinkerer upgrade Shocker's suit and give Fancy Dan (now calling himself "[[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]]") and Ox some super-powered suits of their own, with the team now dubbing themselves the "New Enforcers". The upgraded Enforcers fight Spider-Man in the Metro Bank and, after escaping by disguising themselves as police officers, break into the vault, where they steal millions of dollar worth of gold. The team tries to escape with the gold in a subway train, but they are caught in another battle with Spider-Man, who destroys Ox's suit and causes them to lose all the gold. The Enforcers then try to escape, but Hammerhead sabotages them and they are all apperhended by the police. In the episode "Opening Night", Shocker is seen as an inmate of the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], alongside the other Enforcers, Rhino, [[Molten Man]], [[Silvermane]], and a robot duplicate of Mysterio. They are all released by the Green Goblin to hunt Spider-Man down through the prison, but he manages to escape, and then all the inmantes are knocked out by gas released by [[Walter Hardy]] and returned to their cells.

After a deal with [[Prowler (comics)|Aaron Davis]] attracts Spider-Man's attention, Toomes fires him for recklessness to which Brice threatens to expose Toomes's operation. In response, Toomes fires one of [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Phineas Mason]]'s cobbled-together weapons at Brice, believing it to be an anti-gravity gun, but it turns out to be a disintegration weapon, which instantly kills Brice. After Brice's death, Toomes gives his Shocker vibro-gauntlet to [[Shocker (comics)|Herman Schultz]].
