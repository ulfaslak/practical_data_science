'''Thanos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|θ|æ|n|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|oʊ|s}}) is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by writer/artist [[Jim Starlin]], first appeared in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|The Invincible Iron Man]]'' #55 ([[cover date]]d February 1973). Thanos is one of the most powerful villains in the [[Marvel Universe]] and has clashed with many heroes including the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], the [[Fantastic Four]], and the [[X-Men]].

The character appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], portrayed by [[Damion Poitier]] in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), and by [[Josh Brolin]] in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) through voice and motion capture. The character has also appeared in various comic adaptations, including [[Animation|animated]] television series, [[Arcade game|arcade]], and video games.

==Origin==
Writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]] originally conceived of Thanos of Titan during college [[psychology]] classes. As Starlin described:

{{quote|I went to college between doing [[U.S. military]] service and getting work in comics, and there was a psych class and I came up with Thanos&nbsp;... and [[Drax the Destroyer]], but I'm not sure how he fit into it, just [[anger management]] probably. So I came up to Marvel and [editor] [[Roy Thomas|Roy]] [Thomas] asked if I wanted to do an issue of ''[[Iron Man]]''. I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks. So they got jammed into it. Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he's beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches&nbsp;... and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080122032717/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm "Jim Starlin"]. Adelaide Comics and Books. Archived via the [[Wayback Machine]]. Retrieved March 25, 2014.</ref>}}

Starlin has admitted the character's look was influenced by [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Darkseid]]:

{{quote|Kirby had done the [[New Gods]], which I thought was terrific. He was over at [[DC Comics|DC]] at the time. I came up with some things that were inspired by that. You'd think that Thanos was inspired by [[Darkseid]], but that was not the case when I showed up. In my first Thanos drawings, if he looked like anybody, it was [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]. I had all these different gods and things I wanted to do, which became Thanos and the Titans. Roy took one look at the guy in the Metron-like chair and said: "Beef him up! If you're going to steal one of the New Gods, at least rip off Darkseid, the really good one!"<ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/06/24/comic-book-legends-revealed-266/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #266 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==
Thanos was born on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]] as the son of [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] [[Mentor (A'lars)|A'lars]] and [[Sui-San]]; his brother is [[Starfox (comics)|Eros of Titan]]. Thanos carries the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] gene, and as such, shares the physical appearance of the Eternals' cousin race. Shocked by his appearance and the belief that he would destroy all life in the universe, Sui-San attempted to kill him, but she was stopped by A'lars. During his school years, Thanos was a [[pacifist]]<ref>''Thanos Rising'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and would only play with his brother [[Starfox (comics)|Eros]] and pets. By adolescence, Thanos had become fascinated with [[nihilism]] and death, worshipping and eventually falling in love with the physical embodiment of death, [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Mistress Death]].<ref>''Thanos Rising'' #3, ''Iron Man'' vol 1 #55. Marvel Comics.</ref> As an adult, Thanos augmented his physical strength and powers through his superior scientific knowledge. He also attempted to create a new life for himself by siring many children as well as becoming a pirate. He finds no fulfillment in either until he is visited again by Mistress Death, for whom he murders his offspring and his pirate captain.<ref>''Thanos Rising'' #4–5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Cosmic Cube and Infinity Gems===
Wishing to impress Mistress Death, Thanos gathers an army of villainous aliens and begins a nuclear bombardment of Titan that kills millions of his race.<ref name="AvengersAnnual7">''Avengers Annual'' #7 (1977).

Thanos eventually locates the Cube, and also attracts the attention of Mistress Death. Willing the Cube to make him omnipotent, Thanos then discards the Cube. He imprisons Kronos and taunts [[Kree]] hero [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]], who, with the aid of superhero team the Avengers and [[ISAAC (comics)|ISAAC]] (a super-computer based on Titan), is eventually able to defeat Thanos by destroying the Cube.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #33 (July 1974).

Warlock summons the Avengers and Captain Marvel to stop Thanos, although the plan is foiled when Thanos kills Warlock. The Titan regroups and captures the heroes, who are freed by Spider-Man and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. Thanos is finally stopped by Warlock, whose spirit emerges from the Soul Gem and turns the Titan to stone.<ref name="AvengersAnnual7"/><ref>''Marvel Two-in-One Annual'' #2 (1977).

Marvel Comics.</ref> and during their battles Thanos decimates the planet [[Rigellians (comics)|Rigel-3]].<ref>''Thor Annual'' (2000). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Thanos then uses the heroes Thor and [[Genis-Vell]] (Captain Marvel's son) against the death god Walker, who attempts to woo Mistress Death and then destroy the entity after being rejected.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 2, #17–19 (June–Aug. 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> Thanos then devises a plan to become the All-Father of a new pantheon of gods created by himself. Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers' former member [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] and her son Quoi, who apparently is destined to be the Celestial Messiah. Thanos abandons this plan after having to unite with Mistress Death to destroy the "Rot", a cosmic aberration in deep space caused by Thanos's incessant love for Death.<ref>''Avengers: Celestial Quest'' #1–8 (Nov. 2001&nbsp;– June 2002). Marvel Comics.</ref> Thanos also once conducted extensive research on genetics, studying many of the universe's heroes and villains before [[Cloning]] them, and gene-spliced his own [[DNA]] into the subjects. Although he later abandons the project, five clones survive, being versions of [[Professor X]], Iron Man, [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Doctor Strange]], and Galactus respectively. A sixth and unnamed version of Thanos also appears, and it is revealed the incarnations of Thanos encountered in the past by Thor and Ka-Zar were actually clones. The true Thanos&nbsp;– with the aid of Adam Warlock, Gamora, Pip the Troll, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange&nbsp;– destroys the remaining clones.<ref>''The Infinity Abyss'' #1–6 (2002). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]] Akhenaten uses a [[Heart of the Universe|source of cosmic power]], the Heart of the Universe, to seize power in present-day Earth (killing most of Earth's heroes in the process), Thanos uses a time-travel stratagem to defeat him. Thanos then uses the Heart of the Universe to reverse Akhenaten's actions and was also compelled to correct a flaw in the universe, for which Mistress Death kisses him, and speaks to him for the first time. Changed by the experience, Thanos advises confidant Adam Warlock he will no longer seek universal conquest.<ref>''Marvel: The End'' #1–6 (May–Aug. 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Thanos decides to atone for the destruction of Rigel-3, and agrees to aid a colony of Rigellians in evacuating their planet before Galactus can consume it. During the course of this mission Thanos learns Galactus is collecting the Infinity Gems in an effort to end his unyielding hunger. Thanos later learns Galactus is being manipulated into releasing a multiversal threat called Hunger, which feeds on entire universes. Despite opposition from Thanos, Galactus unwittingly frees the entity, and when its intentions are revealed, the pair team up and attempt to destroy it.<ref>''Thanos'' #1–6(Dec. 2003&nbsp;– April 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>

En route to the [[Kyln]], an intergalactic prison, Thanos meets Death for the first time since re-building existence with the Heart of the Universe. Death claims to be worth wooing, but says Thanos must offer something other than death. At the Kyln Thanos encounters Peter Quill, who has retired himself from the role of [[Star-Lord]], and the Strontian warrior [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] of the [[Shi'ar]] Empire, who are both prisoners, as well as the [[Beyonder]], who has been rendered amnesiac by its choice to assume a [[humanoid]] female form. Thanos battles the Beyonder, causing its mind to shut down and leaving its power trapped within a comatose physical form. Thanos then instructs the Kyln officers to keep the Beyonder on life support indefinitely in order to prevent the entity from being reborn.<ref>''Thanos'' #7–9 (May 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref> The destruction frees Thanos and his fellow inmates, and he finds himself accompanied by the chaos-mite Skreet in his plans to leave the remains of the prison. He discovers, however, that the destruction wrought by the battle with the Beyonder has freed the last prisoner brought in by Peter Quill before he gave up the title of Star-Lord: the [[Fallen One]], revealed to be the true first [[Herald of Galactus]], who had been held in a container deep in the Kyln. Thanos defeats the former Herald and places him under complete mental control.<ref>''Thanos'' #10–12 (July&nbsp;– Sept. 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref> He later appears in [[Wisconsin]] attempting to charge a weapon called the Pyramatrix with the life force of everyone on Earth until he is defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]]. After the battle, [[Uatu]] the Watcher appears and confirms to Squirrel Girl that she defeated the real Thanos, not a clone or copy.<ref>''GLX-Mas Special'' (December 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Annihilation''===

During the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation War]] Thanos allies himself with the genocidal villain [[Annihilus]]. When the Annihilation Wave destroys the Kyln, Thanos sends the Fallen to check on the status of the Beyonder, whose mortal form he finds has perished. Before the Fallen can report back to Thanos it encounters Tenebrous and [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]]: two of [[Galactus]]'s ancient foes. Thanos convinces Tenebrous and Aegis to join the Annihilation Wave in order to get revenge on Galactus, and they subsequently defeat the World Devourer and the Silver Surfer. Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus. Once Thanos learns Annihilus's true goal is to use the [[Power Cosmic]] to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor, he decides to free Galactus.

Thanos somehow later recovers and escapes captivity, and reclaims his [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]] forces from Corvus Glaive.

Presently locked within a maximum security cosmic Alcatraz, Thanos sits alone within a cell as his sickness ravages his body. All while being mocked by its prison warden whom he lured into a false sense of security in order to escape; ripping off his arm for escape access and murdering half his personal staff in a bid for freedom.<ref>''Thanos'' (Vol 2) #4–5</ref> Having narrowly escaped his imprisonment before its self-destruction, Thanos retreats to a hidden outpost where a roving mercenary colony loyal only to him was once stationed. Only to find it decimated at the hand of the new lover of Mistress Death; who reveals that she'd stricken her former avatar with his fatal sickness, being his son Thane, now boasting the power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. Whom under her coaxing, had banished the mad titan back to the decimated Moon of Titan now entirely stripped of his godlike powers.<ref>''Thanos'' (Vol 2) #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

For the next few months, Thanos would survive alone and all but powerless in the ruins of his home city.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Having heard of their plight, the three were dismayed to find Thanos stripped of all he was and had ever been; his second daughter only agreeing to come along so she could kill her father, immediately assaulted him.{{issue|date=April 2018}}

Starfox was able to preempt her attempt at patricide while inviting his wayward tyrant of a brother aboard their vessel. Thanos mentioned the only way for him to be relieved of his mortality was to seek out the God Quarry heralded by The Witches of Infinity. Starfox initially wrote this off as fable and folklore. Now on the path to the cosmic coven set at the edge of the known universe, Thanos and crew stop short of a black hole, knowing full well that it is where the witches make their home. The Mad Titan jumps into the pinhole of nothingness alongside his brother, whom not trusting his butcherous sibling with the supposed infinite power of said collective; having survived the crushing force of the singularity they dove into, Thanos and Eros are greeted by the Coven at the godly graveyard.<ref>''Thanos'' (Vol 2) #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Thanos demands the three that are one to return his godhood to him. Starfox tries his best charm the enchantresses only to be rebuked by them, much to Thanos's joy when they prematurely aged him. Seeing as it was neither their place to destroy nor turn away those seeking them, The Witches profess the only way for the warlord to be made whole again was to climb down into the God Quarry and await a trial that would test his soul. Immediately after setting foot within the graveyard of old gods, Thanos is subsumed into the bedrock within which they rest.<ref>''Thanos'' (Vol 2) #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As his journey of the core being commenced, Thanos's trial began with him as leader of earth and the universes greatest champions, the Avengers. But he's unable to escape the nagging feeling he's forgotten something, till the quarry itself wearing the guise of Falcon reminds him of who he used to be; tempting him to live as a hero and a man at peace for the first time in his immortal life. But Thanos laughs maniacally as he coldly rebukes such a path, ruthlessly killing his would be friends and allies while choosing to remain whom he always was. His cosmic might returned to him, Thanos is freed from the God Quarry, wherein he immediately accosts his brother Eros and threatens the coven to release him from their domain so that he might do away with Thane once and for all.<ref>''Thanos'' (Vol 2) #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At first, Thanos is more than happy to oblige his future counterpart's request, but quickly stops, disappointed at how pathetic and submissive his older self has become. Resolving to never become as pathetic and complacent as King Thanos has become, Thanos uses the fragment of the Time Stone and the [[Power Cosmic]] left in the Surfer's corpse to return to the present day. As the future begins to crumble around him, King Thanos realizes that his younger self has taken the steps necessary to ensure that this timeline will never take place. As he fades into nothingness, King Thanos asks Death what his younger self did, to which she simply responds "he won."<ref>''Thanos'' (Vol 2) #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]]ian Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, but amplified to a higher degree through a combination of his mutant–Eternal heritage, bionic amplification, mysticism, and power bestowed by the abstract entity, Death. Demonstrating enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, immortality and invulnerability among other qualities, Thanos can absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy, and is capable of [[telekinesis]] and [[telepathy]]. He can manipulate matter and live indefinitely without food, air or water, cannot die of old age, is immune to all terrestrial diseases, and has high resistance to psychic assaults. Thanos is also an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in the art of war on Titan.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Thanos has proven himself capable of briefly holding his own in battle against [[Odin (comics)|Odin]],<ref>''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #25 (Feb. 1994). Marvel Comics.</ref> and of blasting [[Galactus]] off his feet.<ref>''Thanos'' #5 (April 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Thanos is a supergenius in virtually all known fields of advanced science and has created technology far exceeding that which is found on contemporary Earth. He often employs a transportation chair capable of space flight, [[force shield|force field]] projection, [[teleportation]], [[time travel]], and movement through [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s. Thanos is also a master strategist and uses several space vessels, at least three under the name "Sanctuary", as a base of operations.
