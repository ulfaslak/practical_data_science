'''Sin''' ('''Sinthea Schmidt''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is the daughter of the [[Red Skull]] and an enemy of [[Captain America]].

==Publication history==
Sin first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #290 (Feb 1984), and was created by [[J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Paul Neary]].

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:SinAging.png|thumb|left|Sin (left and middle) being aged into adulthood as Mother Superior (right). Art by [[Paul Neary]].]]
Seeking an heir, the Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) fathered a daughter with a washerwoman. After the woman died in childbirth, the Red Skull angrily almost killed the child due to being a girl. But follower [[Mother Night (comics)|Susan Scarbo]] convinced not to, telling him she would raise the girl herself as her nanny. The Red Skull agreed and left the girl now named "Sinthea Schmidt" with Scarbo to be raised and indoctrinated with the Red Skull's views as she grew up. Red Skull returned when Sinthea was a child and put her in a machine that had her aged into adulthood and gave her superhuman powers.<ref>''Captain America'' #298 [[Marvel Comics]], (October 1984)</ref>

As '''Mother Superior''', she became the leader of a group called the '''Sisters of Sin''', young orphan girls who were accelerated into adulthood and given [[Psionics|psionic]] powers by the Red Skull after being indoctrinated by Sinthea. The Sisters of Sin would have many run-ins with [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers) before being de-aged when they entered a chamber designed to reverse the Red Skull's aging process and they were restored to children (she would later claim she was deaged to the wrong age - but whether this is true or not is unclear).{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Later, Mother Night reformed the Sisters of Sin and became their new leader, while the de-aged Sinthea herself took the name '''Sister Sin'''.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Sometime later, she was captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and taken to their reeducation facility, where they reprogrammed her with false memories as the "normal" American girl '''Erica Holstein'''. After the Red Skull was seemingly assassinated by the Winter Soldier under [[Aleksander Lukin]]'s orders, [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] broke into the facility, kidnapped her and tortured her to break the reprogramming. After he succeeded, she simply called herself "Sin" while she entered into a relationship with Crossbones and the two went on a killing spree. She later reunited with the Red Skull while her father was living inside Lukin's mind.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #21 Marvel Comics (October 2006)</ref>

As the first part of the Red Skull's master plan, Sin disguised herself as a nurse after the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] while Crossbones sniped Captain America at the courthouse, even though it meant obeying her father and abandoning Crossbones to his fate. Sin then revealed to [[Sharon Carter]] that Carter was the one who had killed Captain America. Now the leader of a new incarnation of the [[Serpent Squad]], Sin breaks Crossbones out of jail. He is later apprehended again and Sin wounded in an attempt to break into the Capitol Building. Sin is later sent to assassinate the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, but is stopped by Captain America ([[Bucky Barnes]]).<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #42 Marvel Comics</ref> In ''[[Captain America: Reborn]]'', Sin attempts to assist [[Norman Osborn]] to put her father in Steve Rogers's body; however, she is injured by the explosion of her father's mechanical body and her face is hideously scarred.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #6 Marvel Comics</ref>

She is later visited in prison by [[Baron Helmut Zemo]] for information on Bucky.<ref>''Captain America'' #606 Marvel Comics</ref> Sometime later, [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]] springs her from prison, prompting her to take her place as the new "'''[[Red Skull]]'''".<ref>''Captain America'' #612 Marvel Comics</ref> She delivers a video to the media recorded three months before Barnes' trial, declaring that the reformed hero was not brainwashed, but was an accomplice and fully aware of these actions.{{issue|date=December 2012}} She, along with Master Man, is later seen on Ellis Island where she pretends to blow up the ''[[Statue of Liberty]]'' with [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] bound and gagged inside, unless Bucky is delivered to her.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Sin, with Baron Zemo's help, unearths the Hammer of [[Skadi]] and becomes Skadi in order to free the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]: God of Fear from his underwater prison. Sin vows to do what her father failed to do in taking over the world.<ref>''Fear Itself: Book of the Skull'' Marvel Comics</ref> She succeeds in her mission in freeing the Serpent and then prepares an army of Nazis to take over the D.C. Capital.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #1 Marvel Comics (April 2011)</ref> During their battle in Washington, D.C., Skadi mortally wounds the current Captain America.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #3 Marvel Comics (June 2011)</ref> In the final battle, Skadi battles Rogers. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] gives Rogers the hammer Mjolnir to make up for the loss of the [[Captain America's shield|shield]]. Thor manages to kill the Serpent and Odin strips the Worthy of their hammers, causing Sin to lose Skadi's powers. This leaves Sin incapacitated.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #7 Marvel Comics (October 2011)</ref>

Sin later returns as one of the villains working alongside Zemo as part of a plot to forcibly sterilize the human race. She battles Captain America (Sam Wilson) and apparently falls to her death after refusing to allow the hero to save her from an explosion.<ref>''All-New Captain America'' #1-3</ref>

After meeting the mysterious Kobik who was created from a shard of the Cosmic Cube, Sin's face was restored to normal.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #2</ref> At the end of the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Sin was with Red Skull's clone when he re-establishes HYDRA with Crossbones.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega'' #1</ref>

When Jane Foster is forced to step down from her role on the Congress of the Nine Realms by [[Serpent (comics)|Cul Borrson]], the twisted god attempts to nominate Sin as Midgard's new representative, but Jane has already appointed S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Roz Solomon as her replacement.

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Sin and Crossbones are shown to be in charge of a super-prison that was established by HYDRA. Their super-prison was raided by the Underground in their mission to free their captive friends.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Sin appears to have no superhuman abilities but being trained by her father, the Red Skull, through which she is an expert hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist. She is also highly proficient in firearms and explosives, and has a high-level intellect.

As Mother Superior, Sin possessed a range of superhuman powers including [[telepathy]], [[telekinesis]], [[teleportation]] and [[Wiktionary:intangible|intangibility]]. After she was de-aged, she apparently lost these powers completely - unlike the other "Sisters of Sin", whose powers were diminished but not eliminated upon de-aging. The reason for this discrepancy has never been revealed.

As wielder of the Hammer of Skadi, Sin as "Skadi" could fly or propel herself through water at great speeds. She could also release large amounts of electricity and energy from the hammer and teleport herself to other places. The hammer could also be used as a blunt-force melee weapon or as a throwing projectile. She eventually lost these powers after the Hammer was apprehended.
