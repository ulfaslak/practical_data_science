Basil Elks is a petty thief who breaks into a museum to steal what he believes is an ordinary [[emerald]] - but is in fact an alien [[Kree]] artifact called the Alpha Stone. Elks, however, miscalculates the security guards rounds and is caught and fired upon when he reaches for a weapon. The guard’s bullet accidentally hits and shatters the gem, causing an explosion that transforms Elks into a humanoid reptilian - his skin becomes green and scaly and his eyes are now large and red. Elks then flash-freezes the guard in place, and realizing that he now has superhuman abilities, decides to become a supervillain and calls himself the Basilisk. He faced off against [[Spider-Man]], [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] and the [[Mole Man]] which ended with him being imprisoned in another Kree artifact called the Omega Stone which ended up in lava.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #16-17 (Dec. 1973 - Jan. 1974)</ref>

The Omega Stone he was imprisoned in was found in a lava river by some Moloids who worshiped it.<ref name="Marvel Team-Up #47">''Marvel Team-Up'' #47 (July 1976)</ref> After absorbing the Omega Stone into himself (thus increasing his power to its fullest potential) and breaking free, he fought [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and defeated him until Spider-Man arrived.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #16-17 (July 1976)</ref> After hearing Basilisk's origin, Spider-Man manages to help Thing regain consciousness and they fight Basilisk.

[[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]] pulled Basilisk from his timeline and paired him up with [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], [[Ulysses Bloodstone]], [[John Jameson (comics)|Man-Wolf]] and Gyre to compete against Sphinx's elder self and his team consisting of [[Black Bolt]], [[Darkhawk]], [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Namorita]], and [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]].<ref>''Nova'' #33-35</ref>

Basilisk reappeared in the [[Fictional crossover#Comics|crossover]] storyline involving the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], a [[vigilante]] who assassinated numerous minor supervillains. Seeking retaliation against Thing the character tunneled his way to the headquarters of the [[Fantastic Four]] which was undergoing construction, but was murdered by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #289 (April 1986)</ref>

Dead Ringer later acquired a tissue sample from Basilisk's body and assumed his form.<ref>''Captain America'' #429</ref>

The Basilisk was resurrected - with sixteen other criminals murdered by Scourge - by master criminal the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of the entity [[Dormammu]]. The revived characters form a squad to attempt to eliminate [[Punisher]]; the Basilisk completed the mission by capturing Punisher.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7 #5-10</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Basilisk is among the villains that escape from the Raft after [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] takes the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone and damages the facility heavily. He assists [[Man-Bull]], [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], and another escaped inmate in a bank robbery. When [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] arrives, he recognizes that the fourth person with them is actually [[Hecate (Marvel Comics)|Hecate]]. Basilisk joined Man-Bull and Griffin in fighting Hercules until Hecate regained her memories.<ref>''Herc'' #3</ref> When a revived Kyknos attacks Hercules, Basilisk and Man-Bull flee.<ref>''Herc'' #4</ref> Hercules and the Griffin manage to find where Basilisk and Man-Bull are hiding and recruit their help. The villains approach Hecate and Kyknos using a ruse involving Hercules being turned to stone. Hercules quickly revives and saves the villains by killing Kyknos, while Hecate escapes.<ref>''Herc'' #5-6</ref>

Basilisk was later hired by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] where he was paired up with [[Looter (comics)|Looter]] to steal the Ellsworth Sonic Reducer. Both of them are defeated by [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Spider-Man's body) and are webbed up for the police.<ref>''Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #11</ref>

Gifford is a dysfunctional person who turns to [[Satanism]] to create an alternate persona, the Basilisk. Possessing a paralyzing stare, the Basilisk goes to battle the [[anti-hero]] [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]].<ref>''Morbius the Living Vampire'' #5-6 (Jan.-Feb. 1993) & 24 (Aug. 1994)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Upon absorbing the Alpha Stone, the Basil Elks version of Basilisk possessed enhanced physical strength, reflexes, and stamina. The Basilisk's main offensive weapon were his eye beams, which could be concussive force (these could also be directed at the ground for limited flight) or energy that manipulated temperature (to [[boiling]] or [[freezing]] extremes) or molecules.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #16-17</ref> Upon absorbing the Omega Stone, Basilisk's powers increased to their full extent, allowing him to generate volcanoes worldwide, including in the Savage Land and New York City.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #16-17 and ''Marvel Team-Up'' #47</ref>

The Mike Columbus version of Basilisk possesses an overly-fleshy head devoid of all features except for sunken ears, a slit-like mouth, and a single centered eye socket. A camera-like device is located in this socket that allows Basilisk to control his superhuman mutant ability to emit a pulse of high-frequency strobe light from his brain. The light paralyzes any sentient being that views it, with the length of the effect varies depending upon the willpower of the onlooker.

Wayne Gifford was a normal human until becoming the Basilisk, a large humanoid reptile. The creature possesses superhuman strength and agility, and a paralyzing stare. The Basilisk's one weakness is its reflection, which serves as a reminder of its former state.
