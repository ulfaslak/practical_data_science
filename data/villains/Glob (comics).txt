'''Joe Timms''' was born in Miami, Florida. Timms was a petty criminal and an escaped convict who drowned in a swamp bog following his escape after he heard his wife was dying. Timms was transformed by radioactive waste into a strange, slime-like, shambling monster named the '''Glob''', with superhuman strength but with very little intelligence. He menaced [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]], and battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. He was destroyed by an experimental anti-radiation fluid in the swamp waters.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #121</ref> Shortly thereafter, he was resurrected by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], who sent him against the Hulk again. The Glob was blown into fragments by an explosion.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #129</ref>

The Glob's brain later reformed into the Golden Brain. It was used as a weapon by Yagzan and the Cult of Entropy, but was lost by the Entropists in an encounter with the [[Man-Thing]]. The Golden Brain psionically molded itself into an amnesiac blond-haired man. The man was later captured and mutated by Yagzan into a clay form version of the Glob.  It battled the Man-Thing and was reduced to clay again, which smothered Yagzan, killing him.<ref>''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #1</ref>

However, it was later revealed that the Glob had re-formed and had been enslaved by the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]. It eventually rebelled against him with the assistance of the Hulk and the Man-Thing.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 1 #197-198</ref>

The Glob was then taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody where it was recruited in that organization's [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Paranormal Containment Unit]].<ref>''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #2-6</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, the Glob was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1</ref>

'''Sumner Samuel Beckwith''' was a geneticist working for the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] who injected himself with an experimental duplicate of the Super-Soldier Formula that he created himself (after discovering the journals of Ted Sallis, who had become the Man-Thing because of his own research in recreating the formula), which turned out to be defective. He transformed into a light-green semi-humanoid being seemingly composed of bog matter and became the second '''Glob'''. It fled to the Florida Everglades, menaced [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], who mistook it for the original Glob. It was incinerated by the Man-Thing's touch after it felt fear.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #389</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Both Globs were monstrous creatures that resembled a semi-solid mass of slime and bog-matter, with superhuman strength, stamina and durability, though both were limited in intelligence and reflexes. The Globs' bodies are difficult to harm, due to their semi-solid build that could absorb physical attacks painlessly.

Joe Timms became the Glob due to exposure to radioactive waste in a swamp bog. As the Golden Brain, he had the ability to materialize a powerful electrically charged duplicate of the Glob and recreate himself as a physically perfect version of his human form.

Sumner Beckwith became the Glob when he was injected with an experimental duplicate of the Super-Soldier Formula. Unlike his predecessor, he did not seem to possess quite enough strength to seriously menace the Hulk, spending most of their brief battle on the receiving end of the damage. Before his transformation, he had earned a Ph.D. in genetics and was a skilled geneticist.
