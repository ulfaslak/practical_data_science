'''Blackout''' ('''Marcus Daniels''') is the name of a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first character to use the name within the fictional universe.

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=June 2016}}
Blackout first appeared in ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'' #19 and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Carmine Infantino]], and [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]].

==Fictional character biography==
Marcus Daniels was born in [[Flushing, Queens]], New York City. He was working as a laboratory assistant to Dr. Abner Croit, a physicist hoping to build a device capable of tapping into energies from other dimensions. Croit always looked down on Daniels' inferior knowledge, making him feel useless. Daniels always wondered what it would be like to harness the energy they were researching, to be powerful. After an accident bathed him in the extra-dimensional energy of the [[Darkforce]], he had the chance to find out. Calling himself Blackout, his body was now flushed with power, becoming a surface of control of the Darkforce dimension. However, despite his powers threatening to go out of control, he escaped from Croit's attempts to cure him and fled.

Blackout returned to the laboratories, however, as he needed the stabilizer device to control his energies. But he also returned to find revenge on Croit— Blackout's sanity began to suffer as well. He believed Croit was researching energies from "Black Stars" and that his body now generated such energy. He further believed that Croit was defrauding the government with his research and had bribed a judge to frame him for stealing his secrets. Instead of an accident causing his powers, Daniels thought Dr. Croit willfully subjected him to an experiment in exchange for dropping charges against him.

[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] encountered Blackout on his way to exact revenge, and Blackout easily defeated the young hero. Before Nova could catch up with him, Blackout returned to the labs, killing Croit and his new assistant by letting them “merge with the color spectrum” (actually, by shunting them to the Darkforce dimension). Following another skirmish with Nova, Blackout himself vanished into this dimension when he fell back onto the stabilizer during the battle, destroying it.<ref>''Nova'' #19</ref>

The stabilizer somehow ended up at [[Project Pegasus]], the government energy research laboratory. An attack by the Lava Men and the presence of [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]] (Monica Rambeau) managed to activate the device, which transported Blackout back to Earth. Still suffering from the delusion that Croit was still alive and out to harm him, he tried to escape. Blackout was coerced by another Project captive, [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], into freeing herself and other superhuman criminals [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] in order to gain revenge on their captors. The villains were confronted by the Avengers, but Blackout and Moonstone escaped to the Darkforce Dimension by nearly causing the nuclear core of the complex to melt down as a distraction.

Moonstone, a former psychiatrist, treated Blackout in order to learn his true origin, but he remained in an irrational state. When the Avengers tracked them down, Blackout opened up another aperture into the Darkforce dimension in attempting to escape them, sucking himself and Moonstone inside.<ref>''Avengers'' #236-238</ref> Moonstone helped Blackout navigate through the dimension, eventually arriving on the surface of the moon. She hoped to find another stone similar to that which gave her powers, but they encountered the [[Inhumans (comics)|Inhumans]] and their ally, [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], who defeated the villains and returned them to Project: Pegasus on Earth.<ref>''Dazzler'' #32</ref>

Moonstone next appeared recruited by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] to form his version of the [[Masters of Evil]], and she brought Blackout in tow. By this time, Blackout's mental condition was so unstable that at times he sank into a nearly catatonic state, only responsive to Moonstone's manipulative commands. Zemo, however, with the help of the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] had created a device to mentally force Blackout to obey his commands. Blackout was instrumental in Zemo's takeover of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' [[Avengers Mansion|headquarters]] by sending the entire mansion into the Darkforce dimension in one of the team's darkest hours. [[Doctor Druid]], used his psychic ability to break through Zemo and Moonstone's manipulations, restoring some of Blackout's mental faculties. With relative sanity restored, Blackout resisted Zemo's mental commands, the strain of which made Blackout collapse from a massive cerebral hemorrhage.<ref>''Avengers'' #273-277</ref>

Blackout's body was remanded into the custody of the Commission on Superhuman Activities.{{issue|date=April 2017}} Years later, his body was taken by Baron Zemo, manipulated like a puppet on strings to serve as a member of his team as he confronted the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] over the life of their member [[Genis-Vell|Photon]]. During the battle between the two teams, Zemo revealed Blackout was merely a shell in which he kept the [[Smuggler (comics)|Smuggler]] trapped. This had the desired effect of turning his brother, [[Erik Josten|Atlas]] against his team, and Zemo gained the upper hand. He also used Blackout's access to the Darkforce dimension in severing Photon's physical form.{{issue|date=April 2017}}

A person who looks like the original Blackout appears as part of the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s alliance with super-powered heroes.<ref>''New Avengers'' #61</ref> He was later seen during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] as part of the Hood crime syndicate.<ref>''Siege'' #3</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Blackout in the alias of "Bob Hofstedder" is later seen living as a married family man until he is found by Baron Zemo, who persuades him to join the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Damnation (comics)|Damnation]]" storyline, Blackout is revived when Doctor Strange uses his magic to restore Las Vegas.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Damnation'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The first Blackout was exposed to cosmic radiation, giving him the power to tap into the [[Darkforce]], a source of infinite dark energy, and to manipulate it in various ways. He could project Darkforce as concussive energy with tremendous force. Blackout could mentally open portals to and from the Darkforce dimension. He could create and control simple, solid geometric shapes from Darkforce, such as discs, cubes, spheres, cylinders, and planes. These objects absorbed energy directed against them, and would remain solid as long as he exerted conscious control over them. He could psionically levitate Darkforce objects, and could fly by riding on them. Blackout was mentally unstable due to his time spent in the Darkforce Dimension, and sometimes entered a nearly catatonic state. His control over Darkforce was dependent on his mental clarity, and would weaken when he was fatigued. Training with [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] allowed him to maintain his Darkforce constructs for a considerably longer period of time. Blackout wore a costume with circuitry that helped him confine the Darkforce within his body. The costume was designed by Dr. Abner Croit. Blackout had a master's degree in physics, especially in the study of radiation.
