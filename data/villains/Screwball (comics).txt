==In other media==
* Screwball appears in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]''. This version of Screwball is a vigilante rather than a villain and the alter-ego of [[Liz Allan]] (voiced by [[Natalie Lander]]). In "Screwball Live!", Screwball sets up reckless pranks on corrupt businesses and live streams them. One of her pranks gets her and [[Randy Robertson]] nearly killed by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Absorbing Man]]. However, they are both saved by Spider-Man. Realizing she was using her internet exposure recklessly, Liz takes a "hiatus" from making more videos. 

* Screwball appears in the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game, voiced by [[Stephanie Lemelin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/7/17819416/spider-man-ps4-villains-guide|title=A guide to the Spider-Man PS4 villains|website=Polygon.com|accessdate=9 September 2018}}</ref> Screwball is part of a side mission where Spider-Man has to partake in a series of challenges before her fans murder a hostage, all while she live streams Spider-Man's feats. Screwball pretends to be the hostage only for her fans to ambush Spider-Man. After Spider-Man defeats her remaining fans, Screwball is arrested while remarking she can't be held responsible since she didn't commit the crimes, but her fans did. She later reappears in the three-part [[downloadable content|DLC]] story "The City That Never Sleeps", having been released and starting a new show where she sets up several challenges for Spider-Man to complete, lest her fans get angry and begin attacking innocents. After reaching 50 million followers, she throws a giant rooftop party, where Spider-Man eventually catches her and leaves her to the cops once more.
