{{About|the Marvel Comics character|the DC Comics supervillain|Kobra (DC Comics)}}
'''Cobra''' is the name of a number of  different fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The most well known "Cobra" is Klaus Voorhees, now known as "King Cobra". He first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #98 (Nov 1963) created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Don Heck]]. His nephew, Piet Voorhees, took over the name "Cobra" and first appeared in ''[[White Tiger (Angela Del Toro)|White Tiger]]'' #1 (Jan 2007) in a story written by [[Tamora Pierce]] and drawn by [[Timothy Liebe]]. Marvel has also used the moniker "Cobra" for two [[World War II]] Nazi villains and also a mercenary enemy of [[Moon Knight]].

Klaus Voorhees was a laboratory assistant, working with a professor trying to find a cure for various poisonous snake bites. A combination of a bite from a radioactive snake and the experimental anti-venom granted him super powers, which led to him becoming the supervillain known as Cobra. Cobra and [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]] formed a criminal team for years, fighting various heroes such as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. He later became a member of the [[Serpent Squad]] and later on a member of [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder's]] [[Serpent Society]]. During a takeover attempt by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] Cobra actually opposed her rule and sided with [[Captain America]] to depose Viper and foiling her plans. Cobra later took the name "King Cobra" as he took leadership of the Serpent Society. When Serpent Society became Serpent Solutions under the leadership of the [[Viper (Marvel Comics)#Jordan Stryke|Viper]] (Jordan Stryke, a different Viper) King Cobra became a member of the group.

Piet Voorhees, nephew of Klaus Voorhees, was injected with the same chemicals that gave Klaus his powers and he became the new Cobra and worked as a mercenary. On one mission he encountered the [[White Tiger (Angela Del Toro)|White Tiger]] who defeated him. Cobra later joined the Serpent Squad, organized by [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] and would also work for [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] as mercenary.

The original Cobra has appeared outside of Marvel Comics, most notably in "The Mighty Thor" portion of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' as well as in episodes of ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' and  ''[[Disk Wars: The Avengers]]''.

Klaus Voorhees was born in [[Rotterdam]], the [[Netherlands]]. Klaus was an ex-convict and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] laboratory assistant to Professor Schecktor, a scientist working in [[India]] and looking for a cure to snake bites. Unsatisfied with his lower condition, and intent on stealing Schecktor's discoveries, Voorhees killed the professor by using a [[cobra]] and in order to make himself look less guilty, let the cobra bite him as well. He used an experimental anti-toxin for snake venom to cure himself, but denied it to Schecktor. The cobra was radioactive due to experimentation, and in a process similar to that which granted [[Spider-Man]] his powers, Voorhees gained superhuman abilities similar to a cobra's. Thor's mortal form Don Blake had encountered Schecktor and as Thor he met the dying man and learnt what had happened, and that the Cobra was travelling to America. The Cobra attempted to manufacture a cobra-serum to transform others into similarly-powered slaves, but was thwarted by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] although he escaped, using Jane Foster as a hostage.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #98</ref>

As the professional criminal called the Cobra, he fought Thor and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and a number of other superheroes. [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]] and the Cobra were partners for years. They first joined forces to get revenge upon Thor, but were jailed.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #105–106</ref> Cobra and Hyde were then bailed and employed by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] to kidnap [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], and Loki doubled their powers. Thor followed them to a house where traps had been set up for him. Mr Hyde was defeated and Thor then manipulated the power supply of the house. Using his hammer he sent a charge through the house that electrocuted the Cobra. The weakened Cobra was forced out of a pipe next to Thor. He was easily defeated by Thor and left bound, before being arrested with Mr Hyde.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #110–111</ref> Cobra then battled Daredevil for the first time.<ref>''Daredevil'' #30–32</ref> He later teamed with the [[Jester (Marvel Comics)#Jonathan Powers|Jester]] and Hyde against Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' #61</ref>

Cobra later joined the original [[Serpent Squad]] with the [[Eel (comics)#Eel (Leopold Stryke)|Eel]] and the [[Viper (Marvel Comics)#Viper (Jordan Stryke)|Viper]]. With the Serpent Squad, he attacked [[Captain America]] and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].<ref>''Captain America'' #163</ref> He subsequently joined the second Serpent Squad, and battled Steve Rogers in his [[Nomad (comics)#Steve Rogers|Nomad]] identity, and then became involved in an attempt to raise the continent of [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]].<ref>''Captain America'' #180–182</ref> He became trapped with the second [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], and his cowardice earned her enmity.<ref>''Captain America'' #183</ref>

Later, he assisted Hyde in an attempt to acquire Cagliostro's serum.<ref>''Daredevil'' #142–143</ref> The [[Purple Man]] then employed him, and Cobra fought Daredevil in an arena alongside Hyde, the Jester, and the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #153–154</ref> Later, Cobra refused to take Hyde along on a jailbreak, effectively ending their partnership, and Cobra got into a battle with Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #46</ref> Hyde began stalking his former partner.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #231–232</ref>

Cobra then joined [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]]'s [[Serpent Society]] crime cartel.<ref>''Captain America'' #310</ref> He teamed with [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] to locate the [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]].<ref>''Captain America'' #319</ref> Later, he went on a mission to poison Washington D.C.'s water supply.<ref>''Captain America'' #343</ref> He also helped Captain America subdue the Viper.<ref>''Captain America'' #344</ref> When Sidewinder retired, the Cobra became the leader of the Serpent Society.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #13</ref> He beat Mister Hyde in personal combat, and then assumed a new costume and the name "King Cobra."<ref>''Captain America'' #365–367</ref> He later sentenced Diamondback for treason to the Society.<ref>''Captain America'' #380–382</ref> He still leads the Society (complete with a new Sidewinder) though he also partners with Hyde on occasion.

Cobra was later summoned by [[Zarrko]] to fight the Thor Corps. Upon arriving he attacked Dargo Ktor, a future version of Thor, before he tosses him to Tyrus the Terrible.<ref>''Thor'' #440</ref>

Cobra was enlisted by [[Lucia von Bardas]], the former prime minister of [[Latveria]] and placed in her secret army of technology-based villains. She sent the army against [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Spider-Man, [[Luke Cage]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and [[Captain America]], the five heroes [[Nick Fury]] had sent to Latveria to stop Lucia's secret criminal funding. When the battle started to turn in favor of the heroes, Lucia turned all the armor of her technology army into a bomb. Nick's unknown agent [[Daisy Johnson|Daisy]] defeated her and the armor army's lives were saved. Klaus escaped the heroes in the resulting battle between Nick Fury and Wolverine.

Piet Voorhees is the nephew of the Klaus Voorhees. Klaus injected Piet with the same mutagenic serum that first gave him his own superhuman abilities. Using these new powers for selfish means, Piet became a high-level international mercenary. He has performed operations in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Chechnya]].

More recently, Cobra has become involved with an international cartel known as Chaeyi. He has been working to get stolen passports and visas to [[illegal aliens]]. This operation has brought him into conflict with the newest [[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|White Tiger]].

In a new costume, he has since turned up as a member of [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]]'s new Serpent Squad, in the employ of the [[Red Skull]]. He breaks Crossbones out of jail<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #28–29</ref> and later attacked the White House, but he was stopped by [[Bucky Barnes|the new Captain America]]. Cobra escaped with Sin in a helicopter and reported the incident to Red Skull.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #35–36</ref><ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update'' #3</ref>

Cobra later appears as a member of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] led by [[Baron Zemo]], who are planning to spread poisonous blood extracted from an Inhuman boy named Lucas. He and [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]] later fight [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], the new Captain America, until Armadillo is convinced to turn on HYDRA and stops Cobra from killing Sam Wilson.<ref>''All-New Captain America'' #1–4</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Cobra appears as a member of [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]]'s Serpent Society under its new name of Serpent Solutions.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #4</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Cobra was with Serpent Solutions when they are recruited by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] to join the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Klaus Voorhees gained superhuman powers due to the mutagenic effects of the venom of a radioactive cobra plus an experimental antidote. Cobra is double jointed, and can dislocate and snap back into place his shoulders and hips at will, and has a phenomenal mastery of his musculature. Most notably his amazing [[contortionist]] powers and slithery body let him break in, and escape from, buildings. He also has the ability to stick to walls or ceilings. Combined with his super-strength, agility, reflexes & reactions, coordination, balance, and endurance  they make him a formidable [[wrestler]]. Cobra's bones are flexible and nearly impossible to break. Cobra has moderate knowledge of street-fighting techniques. The Cobra wears a bodysuit made of reinforced synthetic stretch material; the torso section, helmet, and tail were made of bendable plastoid, and the entire costume is coated with silicon and graphite dust compound to make it slippery. Cobra is also armed with special gadgets that complete his cobra likeness: he is equipped with a "cobra cord" (an unbreakable cable) to tie up his enemies (solid enough to resist Thor's strength), can launch "cobra darts" ([[venom]]-filled projectiles) out of his wrists and release toxic "cobra gas". He wears spring-loaded wrist-shooters propelling "cobra-bite" projectiles containing a poison derived from cobra venom. He uses cartridge projectiles filled with various substances: acids, smoke, nerve gas, plastic explosives, etc. He wears micro-suction cups on his fingertips and toes permitting him to cling to walls and ceilings. In the mini-series ''[[Toxin (comics)|Toxin: The Devil you know]]'', Cobra himself quotes:

{{quote|My bones are almost impossible to break. My tissue doesn't tear. I don't get [[hangover]]s, either.}}

Piet Voorhees possesses certain unusual physical powers derived from his mutagenically altered physiology which among other things help him simulate the movement of a snake by using his great degree of independent control over every muscle in his body, enabling him to slither across the ground (at up to 50 miles per hour), without using his arms and legs, simply by muscle contraction. All of the bones in his body, including his skull, are malleable and his muscle tissue is exceedingly resilient, making his body very flexible and pliant. It is nearly impossible for him to break a bone or tear a muscle.<ref>F.B.I. Agent Coville revealed in ''White Tiger'' #1 that Piet has all of the same super-powers that his uncle possesses.</ref> The Cobra's flexibility enables him to slither into and out of very tight and small places. Through compressing his body, the Cobra can fit into any hole or slot down to four inches (102&nbsp;mm)  in diameter. By using his flexibility to wrap himself about a victim's body and then exerting his full strength, the Cobra traps that victim within his "cobra grip." Unlike his uncle, however, Piet also possesses enhanced olfactory senses, which enables him to track his targets by way of scent. He can also produce a toxic substance from his body which he calls his "cobra venom". He projects his venom at selected targets by spitting at them.

Meanwhile, Marc received Amos Lardner's corpse and went to Ravencrag to see if there was a connection. Marc Spector was present when James Lardner attacked.
