==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:dspayredemon.jpg|thumb|left|D'Spayre materializing. Art by [[Brent Anderson]].]]
D'Spayre is a creation of the [[Dweller-in-Darkness]], a powerful demon who created him to act as his agent on Earth while the Dweller himself is banished from Earth. D'Spayre's first action is to kill the sorceress Zhered-Na, who was the one to banish his creator. To do this, D'Spayre manipulates a barbarian into killing Zhered-Na. Over the next millennia, D'Spayre repeatedly fights Zhered-Na's student, [[Dakimh the Enchanter]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3 #32</ref>

Eventually, D'Spayre captured Dakimh and his pupil [[Jennifer Kale]], but was defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and [[Man-Thing]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #68</ref>

D'Spayre tends to prey on victims who are in despair, using their fear and despair to strengthen himself. He terrorizes [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] and [[Lee Forrester]] after Lee's father committed suicide, but is defeated by Summers, who resists D'Spayre's illusions and finds resolve in the memory of his dead girlfriend [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]]. This resolve fuels the creature known as Man-Thing who attacks D'Spayre and D'Spayre flees.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #144</ref> He then attacks [[Doctor Strange]] when Strange is feeling distraught over separation from his girlfriend [[Clea]], but Strange defeats D'Spayre as well, the first of many battles between the two of them. The Dweller-in-Darkness also menaces D'Spayre at this time.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #32, 37</ref> He later impersonated Darkimh in a vain attempt to drive Doctor Strange into despondency.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #55</ref>

Together with [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], he later attempted to victimize [[Betty Ross]], but was thwarted by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #360</ref> He was next defeated and temporarily weakened by [[Rachel Summers]], a.k.a. the Phoenix.<ref>''Excalibur'' #35</ref>

Over the years, D'Spayre has tried to bring many heroes to despair, resulting in numerous failures.  In one instance, he manipulates the [[List of Marvel Comics demons#Fear Lords|Fear Lords]], powerful demons and gods who feed upon humanity's fears into creating the Great Fear.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 3 #31-33</ref> With their powers combined, the Fear Lords (except for the [[Straw Man (comics)|Straw Man]], who opposes their plan) believe that they can plunge humanity into a permanent state of terror. Most Fear Lords are defeated by Doctor Strange, but Nightmare and D'Spayre's creator, the Dweller-in-Darkness, manage to create the Great Fear. They then discover that D'Spayre has been manipulating them, the Great Fear causes so much terror in humans that they stop fearing and start to despair, feeding D'Spayre, who becomes more powerful than the two of them. Doctor Strange manages to stop D'Spayre, while the Fear Lords flee.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3 #38-40</ref>

D'Spayre is then defeated by [[Amanda Sefton]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #77 (May 1994)</ref>

D'Spayre was also revealed to have infused [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] with portions of his soul, called the Dark Form and Light Form, respectively. He was also revealed to be the creator of the addictive drug called dark-light or "D-Lite," and apparently was consumed by the Dark Form.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' Vol. 3 #19</ref>

D'Spayre attempts to enhance his power by using a [[Cosmic Cube]] to draw on the grief of the general public in the aftermath of [[Captain America]]'s assassination following the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]],"<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #7</ref> only for his use of the Cube to have an apparently unintended side-effect when it granted the 'wish' of those who wanted Captain America back by drawing the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] into the present. He was defeated in a confrontation with the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] when [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]] proved immune to his powers due to her [[Hearing impairment|deafness]], allowing her to take the cube from him.<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #8</ref>

During the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, D'Spayre is among the demons that meet at the Devil's Advocacy to discuss the threat of the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]].<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #627</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
D'Spayre's demonic nature provides him with superhuman strength and durability and the ability to levitate himself and to travel between dimensions. D'Spayre also has the mystical ability to instill fear in human beings and to draw psychic sustenance from the fear, anguish, and despondency suffered by human beings, and other mystical abilities. He has telepathic abilities enabling D'Spayre to perceive a victim's psychological vulnerabilities and to project illusions into the victim's mind. He has a vulnerability to physical harm when weakened by lack of psychic sustenance, and his powers rely on people hearing his words, allowing the deaf Echo to defeat him.

D'Spayre created Darklight, also known as "D-Lite," an addictive drug inducing pain in its victims.
