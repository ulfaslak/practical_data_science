'''Kraven the Hunter''' ('''Sergei Kravinoff''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is one of [[Spider-Man]]'s frequent enemies and the half-brother of Dmitri Smerdyakov, better known as the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]. In 2009, Kraven was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 53rd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/53.html Kraven The Hunter is number 53] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008200756/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/53.html |date=2013-10-08 }}, [[IGN]].</ref>

The character has appeared in numerous Spider-Man adaptations, including animated series and video games. He is widely regarded as one of the most formidable enemies among his rogues. The character gained considerable attention from the story "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]".

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #15 (August 1964), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 26|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= [Stan] Lee and [Steve] Ditko's newest villain, Kraven the Hunter, debuted in this issue.}}</ref> Though he would occasionally appear in other characters' titles, he was most frequently used as a Spider-Man foe. He is killed off in the acclaimed 1987 storyline by [[J. M. DeMatteis]], [[Mike Zeck]], and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]], "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]". Although generally considered to be the definitive Kraven the Hunter story, the story originally had a completely different character in Kraven's role. Writer DeMatteis recounted:

{{quote|As I was getting ready to work on the story, I was sitting in my office and looking through a [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Marvel Universe Handbook]] and came across the entry for Kraven the Hunter. To this day, I don't know if this was something that was established in [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], or if whoever was writing the Handbook entry made it up, but they mentioned that Kraven was [[Russians|Russian]]. For me, a total [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] fanatic, the idea that Kraven was Russian and had the same tortured, Russian soul that the great Dostoyevsky characters had, unlocked this door in my head and suddenly I had a new understanding of this character. I thought about Kraven and the forces that had driven him to be who and what he was. This was a character I had never had any interest in whatsoever. I always thought he was one of the stupidest Spider-Man villains ever, but suddenly I had this whole new take on the character.<ref name="Back35">{{cite journal|last= Johnson|first= Dan|date= August 2009|title= In Our Sights: Kraven's Last Hunt|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|pages= 3–9|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}}

Despite Kraven the Hunter being one of Spider-Man's most long-standing archenemies, DeMatteis claims that none of Marvel's editorial staff objected to the proposal to have him killed in the story.<ref name="Back35"/> Kraven later returns as a ghost in the graphic novel ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man: Soul of the Hunter]]'', also by DeMatteis, Zeck, and McLeod. DeMatteis also wrote "Kraven's First Hunt" for ''The Sensational Spider-Man Annual '96'', a retelling of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #15 which incorporated several DeMatteis [[retcon]]s, such as that Kraven was [[Relational aggression|abusive]] towards the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]].

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:KravenTheHunterByJohnRomitaSr.gif|thumb|upright|Kraven the Hunter depicted by artist John Romita, Sr., circa 1980s.]]
Kraven's real name is Sergei Kravinoff. He is a [[Russia]]n immigrant, the son of an [[aristocrat]] who fled to the United States with his family in 1917 after the [[Execution of the Romanov family|Russian nobility was decimated by the]] [[February Revolution]] and subsequent collapse of the reign of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].

Kraven is a maniacal [[Big game hunting|big game hunter]] who seeks to defeat [[Spider-Man]] to prove that he is the greatest hunter in the world. Unlike other hunters, he typically disdains the use of [[gun]]s or [[archery|bow and arrows]], preferring to take down large dangerous animals with his bare hands. He also lives by a code of honor of sorts, choosing to hunt his game fairly. He consumes a mystical serum to give himself enhanced strength and dramatically slow the [[aging]] process. Kraven was trained as a hunter largely by a mysterious man named '''Gregor''', a [[mercenary]] who battled [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Kraven was at one point lover of the [[wikt:voodoo|voodoo]] priestess [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #310</ref>

He is contacted by his half-brother [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to defeat Spider-Man. He leads Spider-Man to [[Central Park]] with the help of Chameleon, who disguises himself as Kraven to use himself as a decoy while the real Kraven ambushes the hero. However, despite Kraven having weakened Spider-Man with a poisonous dart, Spider-Man prevails in the end. Spider-Man proves a frustrating quarry because Kraven continually underestimates the superhero's resourcefulness.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #15</ref>

Kraven becomes a founding member of the [[Sinister Six]] when he accepts [[Doctor Octopus]]' offer to form a team to fight Spider-Man where they capture [[Aunt May]] and [[Betty Brant]]. He attacks Spider-Man in [[Central Park]] with three [[tiger]]s. Spider-Man easily fights off the attackers and secures the next clue to where Aunt May and Betty Brant are being held. After Aunt May and Betty Brant are rescued, Kraven the Hunter and the rest of the Sinister Six are arrested by the police.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref>

While in the [[Savage Land]], Kraven the Hunter found [[Gog (Marvel Comics)|Gog]] in a spaceship that he stumbles upon. Realizing how useful Gog can be, Kraven the Hunter decides to use him in a plot to conquer the Savage Land. After kidnapping the visiting [[Gwen Stacy]] from a camp in the Savage Land, Kraven and Gog battle the heroes Ka-Zar and Spider-Man.<ref>{{Cite comic

Determined to end his life as he becomes older, frustrated with his failing health and continuing failure to defeat Spider-Man, Kraven sets out a final hunt for Spider-Man. After capturing Spider-Man, he shoots him with a coma-inducing drug and buries him alive on his estate.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #31</ref> To complete his victory, he attempts to become Spider-Man's clear superior by impersonating him in a brutal vigilante campaign and capturing [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], the one foe Spider-Man had never been able to defeat on his own (Spider-Man's last battle with Vermin required [[Captain America]]'s assistance).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #293, ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #131</ref>

After Spider-Man emerges from his grave two weeks later, Kraven explains his actions to him and sets Vermin free, reaffirming to Kraven that his foe is an honorable man. Spider-Man goes after Vermin to prevent his killing again, giving Kraven the opportunity to leave a final [[Confession (law)|confession]] of his crimes against Spider-Man and then commit [[suicide]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #294</ref> Because of his suicide, his soul is unable to find rest until Spider-Man confronts his risen corpse on Kraven's behalf.<ref>{{Cite comic

Kraven is resurrected from the dead by Sasha Kravinoff and the Kraven family with a ritual using the blood of Spider-Man.<ref name=AS635>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635</ref> He is shown to now be explosively [[psychopath]]ic and cold towards his family, beating his son and daughter and expressing little attention towards his wife. After being stabbed by his daughter Ana, Sergei recovers stating that Sasha restored him with corrupted blood which he calls "unlife". They pull off the mask of the corpse of Spider-Man hung in their mantel and discover that [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] is in Spider-Man's costume.<ref name=AS636>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #636</ref> Spider-Man, in his black suit, confronts Kraven and the rest of the Kravinoff Family. Spider-Man is tempted to kill Kraven, but he refuses to do so when he is reminded by [[Julia Carpenter]] (who has inherited the powers of [[Madame Web]] after her death) that committing murder in not in his moral code. Following their defeat by Spider-Man, Kraven and his family escape to the Savage Land. While there, Kraven brutally kills Sasha (who complained that Kraven would have to hunt them to prove their place in the Kravinoff family) and [[Euthanasia|euthanizes]] Vladimir. Alyosha flees in disgust afterwards. Kraven and Ana discuss rebuilding the Kravinoff family, which leads to Ana running off to hunt Alyosha to prove herself worthy to Kraven and rebuild the Kravinoff family.<ref name=AS637>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #637</ref>

It was later revealed that back in the 1950s, Kraven the Hunter was a member of [[Nick Fury]]'s [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] alongside [[Dominic Fortune]] I, [[Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Namora]], [[Silver Sable]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], and [[Ulysses Bloodstone]], tracking a stolen version of the Super-Soldier Serum combined with the Infinity Formula that had been stolen by a group of Nazis attempting to create their own Captain America.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2, #10</ref>

While he is in the Savage Land, [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] lands in the area on an unrelated mission from the federal government. Mistaking him to be Spider-Man, Kraven attacks him and gains the upper hand before Venom escapes.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 3, #3</ref>

At one point, Kraven is contacted by a doctor who once treated him when a past hunt went wrong, the doctor requesting that Kraven track down a recent patient of hers- who had been used as a test subject to duplicate another man's electrical abilities — as well as asking that he capture the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] — currently acting as a 'local' vigilante to regain his sense of self after the destruction of [[Wakanda]]'s [[vibranium]]- in return for her help finding a way for him to die. With the aid of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], T'Challa is able to stay ahead of Kraven long enough to convince him that the doctor had lied about being able to kill him, Kraven agreeing to leave T'Challa alone and take the doctor's mutated animal subjects back with him into the wild.<ref>''Black Panther'' #519-#520</ref>

When their identities became fractured after a temporary separation, the [[Hulk]] discovers that Bruce Banner had hired Kraven to find the lost city of [[Bigfoot|Sasquatches]]. Although Hulk was uninterested with helping the Sasquatches deal with Kraven, he changes his mind and beats up Kraven.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3, #11</ref>

Kaine in the alias of [[Scarlet Spider]] later encountered Kraven the Hunter who was dressed as Scarlet Spider in order to torment him.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2, #21</ref> With the help of Ana, Kraven kidnapped Kaine's friends in order to motivate the Scarlet Spider to fight him. In the end, Kaine delivered Kraven a fatal blow in the chest, which paralyzed his heart. But using the same attack, Kaine brought him back to life supposedly still breaking the curse. Following the fight, both Kravens disappeared.<ref name="Scarlet Spider #23">''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2, #23</ref>

Kraven, still claiming to be cursed, next battles [[Squirrel Girl]] at [[Empire State University]], having earned her ire by lashing out at the local squirrels, including [[Squirrel Girl#Tippy-Toe|Tippy-Toe]]. Kraven departs when Squirrel Girl informs him of the existence of sea monsters like [[Giganto#Giganto (Atlantean beasts)|Giganto]] and challenges him to hunt them, instead of limiting himself to going after the same prey he did prior to his resurrection.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Ryan North|penciller = Erica Henderson|inker = Erica Henderson|title = The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = 7 January 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> He later returns to abduct [[Howard the Duck]],<ref>The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 #6</ref> but gets trapped with Howard and Squirrel Girl in a [[The Most Dangerous Game|manhunt]] as the hunted. After surviving, he vows to only "hunt the hunters."<ref>Howard the Duck Vol 6 Issue 6</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Kraven the Hunter was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. who used Kobik's abilities to turn Kraven the Hunter into a [[zookeeper]]. He rallied some of his fellow inmates to help him find Kobik and bring her to [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]].<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #8</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Kraven the Hunter is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref> At the time when Manhattan was surrounded by a [[Darkforce]] Dome, Kraven the Hunter raided the Daily Bugle in order to find information to the identity of Spider-Man. Knowing that J. Jonah Jameson would be in danger, Phil Sheldon's daughter Jennie headed to J. Jonah Jameson's house to warn him. After Kraven the Hunter attacked J. Jonah Jameson, Jennie Sheldon fired a signal flare into the sky. This attracted the attention of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] who defeated Kraven the Hunter. Jennie Sheldon even took pictures of the fight.<ref>''Secret Empire: Brave New World'' #3</ref>

At the time when [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] encountered some Dinosaur People in the sewers, Kraven the Hunter followed Venom and killed an [[Ankylosaurus]]-type Dinosaur Person before engaging Venom in battle. He was fended off by Venom who vowed to fight Venom again.<ref>''Venom'' #156</ref> Upon the news of Dinosaur People being found beneath the streets of New York City, Mayor [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] and NYPD Commissioner Chris Rafferty appointed Kraven the Hunter to lead a SWAT Team into the sewers and eliminate them. When Venom deactivated each trap and confronted Kraven, Venom was caught off-guard when Kraven the Hunter revealed his secret ally [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] who used her attacks on Venom and then collapsed the ceiling over him. Shriek then tells Kraven the Hunter that she can have Eddie Brock's head after the mission is done.<ref>''Venom'' #157</ref> As the Dinosaur People feed on the rats that enter their lair, Kraven the Hunter sneaks up on some Dinosaur People and kills them. Venom catches up to Kraven the Hunter and fights him and Shriek. With help from Tana, Venom stated that the Dinosaur People weren't killing anybody and that they are only surviving underground. Kraven the Hunter and Shriek are arrested by the NYPD as the captain stated that he never liked Kraven the Hunter anyway.<ref>''Venom'' #158</ref>

Kraven the Hunter was hired by the evil organization Rampart to lure [[Captain America]] to them. After a brief struggle with Kraven the Hunter, Captain America was frozen in ice by Rampart's freeze cannon.<ref>''Captain America'' #697. Marvel Comics.</ref>


More recently he met Squirrel girl who has been helping him reform. She pointed out that Spiderman is not even close to the most dangerous prey in the marvel universe and that Kraven has been doing a lot of not very smart things. They have teamed up several times since then to fight other villains., Kraven has been hunting poachers in his free time, and the two have become friends. 

===Kraven's legacy===
Three of Kraven's children end up following in his footsteps:

* Vladimir Kravinoff took up the name "[[Grim Hunter]]" and decided to hunt down Spider-Man and several of his foes. During the fight with Spider-Man, he is murdered by an insane clone of Spider-Man named [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]]. Sasha Kravinoff later sacrifices [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] as part of a ritual that revives Vladimir in a humanoid lion form during the ''Grim Hunt'' storyline. Sasha later stated to Kraven that Vladimir's appearance was the result of a test revival ritual to see if she can bring him back to life. Vladimir was euthanized by Kraven (which he does due to "respect for the dead") in the Savage Land at the conclusion of The Grim Hunt arc.
* Some time after the death of Vladimir, his half brother and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], becomes the second Kraven.  Ana Kravinoff later killed him to prove herself to her father after Kraven euthanized Vladimir.
* There was a third son named Nedrocci "Ned" Tannengarden who tries to kill Alyosha, but he was murdered by the Chameleon (who during that time believed himself to be the original Kraven the Hunter).<ref>''Spider-Man's Get Kraven'' #1-6 (2002-2003)</ref>
* Kraven's wife Sasha Kravinoff and his daughter [[Kraven the Hunter (Ana Kravinoff)|Ana]], were part of a Gauntlet on Spider-Man's life causing chaos and weakening the web crusader prior to the events that lead to resurrecting Kraven from the grave.

==Powers and abilities==
By regularly ingesting the potion made from various unnamed jungle herbs, Kraven grants himself Ultra Instinct making him a physical threat to Spider-Man, though these powers are not as developed as those possessed by Spider-Man. Kraven's body is also more durable and more resistant to certain forms of injury than the body of a normal human. He can withstand great impact forces, such as falling from several stories or being repeatedly struck by a superhumanly strong opponent, that would severely injure or kill a normal human, with little to no injury to himself. The effects of the potion have dramatically altered Kraven's aging process to the point that he has aged little, if at all, over several decades. Despite being over 70 years of age, he has the physical appearance of a 30-year-old man.

The potion enhances Kraven's sight, hearing, and smell to superhuman levels, adding to his already impressive tracking skills. He can see farther, and with much greater clarity, than a normal human. His hearing is similarly enhanced, enabling him to detect sounds which an ordinary human cannot, or sounds that a normal human could detect, but at much greater distances. Kraven can use his sense of smell to track a target by scent, much as some animals do, even if the scent has been somewhat eroded by natural factors.

Even without his superhuman powers, Kraven is an Olympic-level athlete, and a gifted tactician, hunter and hand-to-hand combatant. He also has great knowledge of [[pressure point]]s, both in the anatomy of humans and in many animals. He can strike at these nerve clusters with pinpoint accuracy, allowing him to incapacitate more-powerful opponents or animals. He is familiar with many exotic poisons and [[sedative|tranquilizers]], which he often uses during his hunts.

Due to a flaw in the ceremony that resurrected him, Kraven was given "the ''unlife'' ... the eternal curse", as he discovered when his daughter stabbed him through the heart. According to Kraven, he can now only die by Spider-Man's hand. However, this curse was apparently broken when Kaine temporarily killed Kraven by stopping his heart and then restarting it with the same move.

When big-game hunter Sergei Kravinoff is attacked and nearly killed by hyenas while saving Dr. Mariah Crawford from them, he is saved by the administration of a miracle drug by Dr. Crawford which, in addition to curing his wounds, grants him heightened senses and physical abilities. Unfortunately, the serum also causes him to become increasingly bestial to the point that he eventually begins "hunting like a jungle animal" and calling himself "Kraven the Hunter". By the end of the episode "Kraven the Hunter", Kravinoff is cured of his insanity. During the second season, Kraven makes a cameo appearance in the episode "Morbius" when he is informed of the mutative disease that is afflicting Spider Man. He returns in the episode "Duel of the Hunters" during which he is called in to hunt Spider-Man who has, by this point, mutated into the monstrous Man-Spider. His hunt is initially interrupted by the [[Punisher]] intending to kill Spider-Man, but the two eventually work together to track down Spider-Man and restore him to his human form with Dr. Crawford's help. In the fourth-season episode "The Return of Kraven", Kraven returns to New York and takes the same serum that caused his initial transformation in an effort to track down a mysterious creature that has been attacking people in Central Park. He encounters Spider-Man several times before being subdued. Kraven then explains that when Dr. Crawford contracted an African plague, he makes the decision to save her life by giving her a dose of the same miracle-drug that had caused his transformation. It worked to cure her, but later caused her to turn into the feline-like monster he currently hunts. By combining their efforts, Spider-Man and Kraven manage to restore Dr. Crawford's sanity, though she retains the mutated body and enhanced abilities gained from the serum. Kraven and Crawford depart together to an unknown location.
* In the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' episode "Enter the Hunter!", the Hunter (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]) is the [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] version of Kraven the Hunter. He is one of a few humans that the [[High Evolutionary]] allows to live in the upper parts of the city. He works as a mercenary for both the rebels and the High Evolutionary and is hired by the latter to hunt and kill, and/or capture Spider-Man. Upon breaking into his lair, Spider-Man discovered that the Hunter was using a toxic formula that when mixed with certain animal pheromones gives traits of that animal to the drinker, but also poisons bone marrow, screws up the liver, and cuts your lifespan in half to which the Hunter stated it's a necessary sacrifice for the power it brings. Spider-Man defeats him by trouncing him and turning his security system against him stating that he now knows the Hunter's secret and if he comes after the Rebels or him again, he will use this knowledge to beat him into the ground.
* Kraven the Hunter appears in the two-part ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'' episode "Mind Games", voiced by [[Michael Dorn]]. The version killed the Gaines wife and husband by poisoning them with a serum but the couple spawned two fraternal children (Roxanne Gaines and Roland Gaines) who got hypnotizing powers from the serum's effects. The Gaines Twins could not use their powers on Kraven as his senses were too keen for their abilities. In the first part, the Twins hypnotized Spider-Man into thinking Kraven killed [[Mary Jane Watson]] and the Twins used this moment to have Spider-Man kill Kraven. In the second part, Spider-Man and Kraven fight inside a warehouse in which Spider-Man almost kills Kraven by hanging him. Luckily, Spider-Man snaps out of the hypnosis and spares Kraven's life in time learning Kraven did not kill Mary Jane. Kraven was handed over to Officer Barr and sent back to jail.
* Sergei Kravinoff appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by Eric Visbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0801/21/index.htm |title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter |publisher=Comicscontinuum.com |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref> Garbed in a lion-themed vest similar to his comic book counterpart, he is the most skilled hunter in the known world, relying only on his natural skills and using his bare hands to subdue his prey. In the episode "Destructive Testing", Kravinoff arrived in New York with Calypso and his pet lion (that was trained to track anything) and had confronted Spider-Man where, to his credit, he provides a reasonable challenge but is still subdued before too long. However, following his first defeat at the hands of Spider-Man, he becomes convinced that the only reason he lost was due to Spider-Man's genetically altered physiology. As such, Kravinoff enlists [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Professor Miles Warren]]'s aid in securing powers of his own. Using a serum concocted from Warren's own research (and based on [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]]'s Lizard formula), Kravinoff is then mutated into a humanoid black-maned [[lion]]-like creature with elements of [[leopard]] and [[cheetah]] DNA (similar to his Ultimate Marvel version). After the mutation, he then changes his name to "Kraven the Hunter" and goes after Spider-Man. With his new form, he easily outruns and overpowers Spider-Man several times throughout their fight (actually forcing Spider-Man to use up all his web fluid against him) and only being narrowly subdued after being tied up with most of Spider-Man's webs. After his second defeat, Kraven is rescued by Calypso on behalf of the Master Planner who asks him if he would like to hunt in [[Sinister Six|a pack]]. This does occur in the episode "Reinforcement" when he is sent to spring [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] from Ravencroft. He only got away with Electro as Doctor Octopus did not want to leave. Thus, Master Planner managed to form the second version of the Sinister Six with him, [[Mysterio]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Electro, [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. After Vulture, Electro, Sandman and Rhino were defeated, he and Mysterio attacked Spider-Man where their fight led to a mall. He was knocked out by an exploding Mysterio robot. Though Mysterio was arrested, Kraven alongside the other four villains were extracted at the last minute by Master Planner. In the episode "Gangland", Doctor Octopus tries to call Kraven for backup, but Doctor Octopus's phone becomes jammed by the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]].
* Kraven the Hunter appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]].<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/19872/ultimate_spider-man_season_2_premieres_jan_21?nav=1 "Ultimate Spider-Man Season 2 Premieres Jan. 21"]. Marvel.com. December 26, 2012.</ref> Introduced in the second season, this version uses high-tech versions of traditional hunting weapons (such as an energy-bladed spear and a wrist-worn force shield) unlike other versions. He aspires to be the greatest hunter in the world where he has been collecting various magical animal-related artifacts from all over the world. He fought the first [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]] (Hector Ayala) to claim the White Tiger amulet and gain its power for himself. Although he kills Hector, the amulet is passed on to the second [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]] (Ava Ayala). Years later in his self-titled episode "Kraven the Hunter", Kraven arrives in New York to hunt White Tiger where he uses a mystical drum to drive White Tiger berserk. At Central Park, Kraven uses high-tech hunting weapons and traps to try to kill White Tiger and Spider-Man. Spider-Man works to keep White Tiger alive, using his webbing to set off Kraven's sound grenade to get away. White Tiger is then attacked by Kraven at the zoo and manages to swipe the White Tiger Amulet and dons it in order to continue attacking Spider-Man and White Tiger as all the animals in the zoo go berserk. Kraven chases Spider-Man and White Tiger out of the zoo and up into some trees. The power of the White Tiger Amulet proves too much for Kraven as it turns him into a humanoid [[white tiger]] with the ability to control the zoo's white tigers. After a tactic that enables White Tiger to reclaim the amulet, Kraven is regressed back to normal. Spider-Man then webs Kraven as he convinces White Tiger not to avenge her father. White Tiger decides not to take Kraven's life as Kraven breaks free. White Tiger and Spider-Man double-team Kraven and knock him out as White Tiger calls up S.H.I.E.L.D. to pick up Kraven.

When Spider-Man's team fights the Sinister Six, Kraven fight White Tiger but is defeated by [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]], After Spider-Man's team defeated the Sinister Six at the [[Statue of Liberty]], most Sinister Six members are imprisoned in the new S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier while Lizard had evaded capture. In the episode "Return of the Sinister Six", Doctor Octopus and Lizard spring the imprisoned Sinister Six members from Ryker's Island and equip them with high-tech armor made from stolen OsCorp technology. Kraven is given a lion-themed armor with razor-sharp mechanical claws. Kraven fights Spider-Man and then White Tiger once again. He also assists in the group's gang assault on [[Norman Osborn|Iron Patriot]]. Eventually, Spider-Man was able to defeat Kraven along with the other Sinister Six members. In the episode "The Savage Spider-Man", Kraven teams up with [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] in a plan to lure [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] to New York by kidnapping [[Zabu]] so that Taskmaster can recruit Ka-Zar to his side. During Taskmaster and Kraven's fight with Spider-Man, Ka-Zar and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Kraven uses a dart with a special poison in it on Spider-Man which transforms him into the Man-Spider. Upon being pursued to Manhattan by Spider-Man, Wolverine and Ka-Zar, Kraven seeks to perform a ritual to become immortal by sacrificing Zabu at sunset (with the ritual occurring once every thousand years) while Taskmaster plans to get Ka-Zar on his side. With help from Wolverine who deals with Taskmaster, Spider-Man and Ka-Zar defeat Kraven who tries to knock Zabu off the bridge only for Spider-Man and Ka-Zar to catch Zabu before he can fall into the river. Kraven is later arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. In "Contest of Champions" Pt. 1, Grandmaster pairs up Kraven the Hunter with [[Molten Man]] and [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] King in the game of "Last Man Standing" against Collector's team of Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Hulk during. Kraven the Hunter coordinated Molten Man and Wendigo in the battle while using some of his traps. When chased by Hulk, Kraven used a special pollen that knocked out Hulk removing him from the game. After Spider-Man did tricks that removed Wendigo King and Molten Man from the game, Spider-Man engaged Kraven the Hunter and eventually defeating him allowing Collector to score the first victory against the Grandmaster. In the episode "HYDRA Attacks" Pt. 2, Doctor Octopus frees Kraven the Hunter, [[Batroc the Leaper]], and [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] from the brig of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Tricarrier-turned-HYDRA Island where he holds a contest where whoever can successfully capture Spider-Man will join his latest incarnation of the Sinister Six. Kraven the Hunter follows Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider into the sewers where they managed to bring some pipes down onto him. Later on, Kraven the Hunter confronts Spider-Man on HYDRA Island in an attempt to defeat him only to be knocked out of HYDRA Island by Scarlet Spider. In the episode "Double Agent Venom," Kraven the Hunter sports new HYDRA armor as he hunts Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider. After abducting Scarlet Spider, Kraven the Hunter takes Scarlet Spider into space where Spider-Man discovers that they are heading to the returned HYDRA Island. After Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider free Flash Thompson following his separation from the Venom symbiote, Doctor Octopus throws Kraven the Hunter into the Venom symbiote which gives him the appearance of a humanoid lion. Flash was able to get the Venom symbiote off Kraven the Hunter and help defeat him. In the episode "The New Sinister 6" Pt. 2, Kraven the Hunter appears as a member of Doctor Octopus' Sinister Six when they attack the Triskelion. During the battle, Kraven the Hunter uses a device that causes Cloak to lose control of his teleportation. In the two-part episode "Graduation Day," Kraven the Hunter fights Cloak, Dagger, Squirrel Girl, and Triton at the docks alongside Vulture. While having trapped Cloak, Kraven the Hunter was tricked into backing up into one of his traps. Upon breaking out of his cell, Kraven the Hunter joined the Superior Sinister Six. During the final battle at Oscorp, Kraven the Hunter got irritated with Spider-Man's non-stop joking and prepared to destroy him, but not before the depowered Rhino and Vulture dropped debris on him knocking him unconscious.
* Kraven the Hunter appears in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Troy Baker]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Kraven's Amazing Hunt|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=10|airdate=September 30, 2017}}</ref> In addition to hosting his own reality show (much like his Ultimate Marvel counterpart), this version has long hair, a cataract in his left eye, a red stripe makeup over his eye areas, scratch marks on parts of his body, and a cybernetic right arm. In the episode "Kraven's Amazing Hunt" (which is also the name of his show), upon being hired by [[Norman Osborn]], Kraven the Hunter broadcasts his latest hunting project to be Spider-Man. To lure him out, he enlisted Scorpion. Once that was done, Kraven the Hunter fought both Spider-Men upon being contacted by Norman Osborn to bring the other [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]] in as well. When Kraven the Hunter started veering from the deal and fought Spider-Man at the Central Park Zoo, [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] knocks out Kraven the Hunter with a sonic attack and then knocks out Spider-Man so that Norman Osborn can obtain Spider-Man's DNA at one of his facilities. Upon Miles Morales sneaking in to an Oscorp facility to rescue Spider-Man, he tricks Vulture into destroying something unstable causing both Norman Osborn and Vulture to escape while Spider-Man and Miles Morales frees Kraven the Hunter, allowing him to get away. He later appears in "Spider Island Part 3" as he starts to hunt down Gwen Stacy and Norman Osborn (who have mutated into Man-Spiders), but is stopped by Peter Parker, Anya Corazon, and Harry Osborn.

Under [[Norman Osborn]]'s orders, he poisons Spider-Man with a toxic gas and puts him in a maze forcing Spider-Man to avoid various traps (and Kraven's attempts to shoot him) as he is weakened by the poison. After the maze level, Spider-Man fights Kraven for the cure. Kraven initially makes use of a hunting rifle to shoot Spider-Man, but after a brief time, he makes use of a strength-enhancing potion that makes him pretty much invulnerable to physical attack, remarking "A True Hunter does not need guns", though despite this, Spider-Man wins putting Kraven in jail for his crimes. He also appeared in the Game Boy Advance version of the game as a mercenary working for Osborn. He first fights Spider-Man in a ship's hold and is relatively easy to beat. He appears again later in a [[funhouse]] at [[Coney Island]] where he demonstrates all his abilities and is even harder to defeat than he was before.

Spider-Man promptly escaped, but Kraven has a piece of the Tablet of Order and Chaos which has given him enhanced speed to the point where most of Spider-Man's attacks are easily dodged. Spider-Man must get it and in a twist to the usual Kraven/Spider formula, Spider-Man hunts the Kraven through Kraven's jungles. Spider-Man defeats Kraven at the top of the temple and claims the piece of the Tablet of Order and Chaos. During the credits, Kraven is shown chasing a [[rabbit]] like a cat probably due to head injury (his head is bandaged up).
