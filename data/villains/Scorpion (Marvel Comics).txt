==Fictional character biography==
===Monster Scorpion===
The first Scorpion was seen as a giant monster. During an experiment with a [[bismuth]] isotope, Paul Rodgers accidentally struck a normal scorpion with a stream of [[delta particle]]s. It was mutated into a giant monstrous form and gained the consciousness to hate the human race. It told Paul Rodgers and Edward Bentley that it would mutate another bunch of scorpions and take over the world. Edward managed to hypnotize the Scorpion into thinking that it was feeling the pains from the radiation poisoning. When the Scorpion begged for Paul and Edward to end its life, they complied and killed the Scorpion by firing another stream of delta particles at it.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #82. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Sam Scorpio===
'''Sam Scorpio''' is an inventor who used his "sting" (a derringer fitted to a silencer on his forearm) to terrorize the [[American frontier|Old West]]. Scorpion later encountered [[Kid Colt]] while running from a 50-man posse and begged for his help. Kid Colt refused until an earthquake occurred and they hid under a boulder. By the time Kid Colt and Scorpion emerged, the posse caught up to them and they were taken to prison. While in jail, Scorpion used his "sting" on a guard. Upon grabbing the guard's keys, Scorpion forced Kid Colt to accompany him. He took Kid Colt to a hideout in the hills and wanted Kid Colt to join him. When Kid Colt asked about the secret of his "sting," Scorpion turned on him. Kid Colt shot out the lamp for cover from Scorpion's sting and Scorpion fled where he told the posse where they can find Kid Colt. Afterwards, Scorpion set up a gang where he kept them in line with his "sting." Kid Colt went after Scorpion's gang upon figuring out what his gimmick was. Kid Colt defeated Scorpion's gang and defeated Scorpion in hand-to-hand combat before he could use his "sting." Kid Colt then turned Scorpion and his gang over to the authorities.<ref>''Kid Colt, Outlaw'' #115. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Scorpion was imprisoned in a State Prison where he was part of a chain gang with Dr. Danger and Bull Barton. When Kid Colt ended up in the same prison after turning himself over to the law, Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton decided that this was the opportunity for revenge. One day, they attacked Kid Colt in unison while on work detail. When a prison guard intervened, they took his gun, overpowered the guard, and broke their chains. Then they grazed Kid Colt with another bullet and fled. Across the border, Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton came across a town where Fred Yates (the man that Kid Colt turned himself over to) lived. When Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton confronted Fred Yates and his sister Susan, Fred fled in sheer terror. Kid Colt caught up to the trio, disarmed them, and saved Susan. Kid Colt then sent Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton back over the border to the waiting arms of the law.<ref>''Kid Colt, Outlaw'' #118. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Mac Gargan===
{{main|Mac Gargan}}
'''Mac Gargan''' first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #19 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]]. He was a private investigator who was hired by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to find out how Peter Parker was able to obtain the photos of [[Spider-Man]]. When Spider-Man evaded Gargan, J. Jonah Jameson decided to use Gargan as a test subject for an experiment done by [[Farley Stillwell]] which led to Gargan becoming the Scorpion in order to defeat Spider-Man. Many years later, Gargan becomes a host for the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote. After the Venom symbiote was removed from him in the aftermath of the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, Gargan was sprung from the Raft by [[Alistair Smythe]] and outfitted with a new Scorpion suit.

===Jim Evans===
'''Jim Evans''' is a successful apothecary in Dustville during the Old West. He began to date Sarah (the prettiest girl in town) until she began to neglect him upon stating that she already has a boyfriend in Matt Cody. Matt Cody was not pleased that Sarah went out with Jim and challenged him to a shootout. Jim drew his gun first and only managed to wing Matt in the left arm as Matt managed to shoot Jim's gun out of his hand. Matt then made Jim dance with his gun. Jim was humiliated and vowed revenge. Upon inventing a liquid paralytic that he can fire no matter where he would hit them, Jim took on the identity of Scorpion and embarked on a crime spree. Scorpion managed to hold up a stagecoach and the sound of his gun attracted the attention of [[Rawhide Kid]]. Rawhide Kid managed to tackle Scorpion who hit Rawhide Kid with a paralytic pellet and continued to rob the stagecoach where he made off with the payroll. Upon questioning the nearby town about Scorpion, Rawhide Kid learned that there had been an apothecary who had been around for four months which allowed Rawhide Kid to determine his identity. Rawhide Kid followed Jim to an abandoned mine, watched him change into Scorpion, and then confronted him. Their fight collapsed the mine and Rawhide Kid fell into an underground stream. Rawhide Kid recovered and went after Scorpion again. When Scorpion fired the paralytic pellet again, Rawhide Kid twisted Scorpion's wrist causing Scorpion to get hit by his own paralytic pellet. Rawhide Kid then turned Scorpion over to Dustville's sheriff.<ref>''Rawhide Kid'' #57. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After six months in jail, Jim Evans managed to mix up a small amount of his stun potion in the prison workshop. He used it on a guard, grabbed his keys, and escaped from jail. Taking on the alias of '''Sting-Ray''', Jim Evans went on another crime spree until he arrived in Bison Bend and decided to settle there as the base of his ultimate destiny as the Emperor of the West. Sting-Ray robbed a bunch of people at Bison Bend's square dance. Clay Riley and Sheriff Ben Brooks tried to stop him, but ended up victims of his stun pellets. Sting-Ray later kidnapped Sheriff Ben Brooks' daughter Natalie holding her hostage until he got the power he demanded. However, he was foiled by [[Phantom Rider]] who attacked Sting-Ray. Phantom Rider managed to defeat Sting-Ray and unmasked him after he was distracted by Natalie's shouting. The sheriff and his men arrived and chased after Phantom Rider.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Elaine Coll===
'''Elaine Coll''' is recruited by [[Silvermane]] from a [[mental hospital]] to become the new Scorpion. She opts to call herself '''Scorpia''' instead and is given robotic armor which enhanced her strength and speed five hundred percent. Scorpia successfully brings [[Deathlok]] to Silvermane, and is ordered to ambush Spider-Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], who had infiltrated their base. She wears them down, but is then betrayed by Silvermane, who shoots her in the back. Scorpia follows Spider-Man and Daredevil to Silvermane's location, and once there immediately attacks him. Mainframe, another of Silvermane's mercenaries, takes control of Scorpia's cybernetic enhancements and uses her to attack Spider-Man. However, she soon regained mobility and blasted Silvermane. An explosion created by [[Punisher|The Punisher]] knocked Scorpia off the building they were on, but a mentally conflicted Deathlok saved her. She then decided to flee the area, rather than be put in prison.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Power of Terror'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Scorpia then joins the new [[Sinister Six]] (though there were seven members total). The team's main purpose was to stop [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] from killing any more of Spider-Man's enemies. When Kaine disguised himself as Spider-Man and attacked Hobgoblin, Scorpia immediately joined the others in the battle. However, they were not accustomed to working together, much to Scorpia's disdain. Spider-Man eventually entered the battle and was able to defeat Scorpia herself. She also participated in another battle against Spider-Man with some of her former allies, and new ones such as [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O' Lantern]]. She was defeated when Spider-Man threw Jack O'Lantern at her.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Much later, Scorpia fights Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], and is defeated when Black Cat rips her tail off.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil Men Do'' #2</ref> She later reveals that she was hired by Alberto Ortega, the head of a local drug syndicate.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil Men Do'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" storyline, Scorpia appears as one of the female villains in the employ of Caroline Le Fay. She helps fight off [[Thanos]]' forces and later battles the [[Fearless Defenders]].<ref>''Fearless Defenders'' #10</ref> Scorpia remained in Le Fay's employ afterward, acting as one of her bodyguards during a meeting with the Mercs for Money.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Salva Espin|inker = Salva Espin|colorist = Guru-eFX|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

* An unnamed version of Scorpion appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Dante Basco]] (in the season 2 episodes "Journey of the Iron Fist" and "Return of the Sinister Six"),<ref name="Journey of the Iron Fist">{{cite episode|title=Journey of the Iron Fist|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=13|airdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref> and by [[Eric Bauza]] (in the series finale "Graduation Day").<ref name="Graduation Day Pt. 1">{{cite episode|title=Graduation Day Pt. 1|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=25|airdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> He also makes unspeaking appearances in the season 3 episodes "Agent Venom" and "New Warriors". This version is a [[composite character]] between the classic Scorpion and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] villain [[Steel Serpent]], and is portrayed as a skilled yet arrogant warrior from [[K'un-L'un]], who wields a long [[kusarigama]] resembling a scorpion tail and is Iron Fist's rival for the title of king of K'un-L'un; his original costume is also a reference to the [[Mortal Kombat]] character [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]]. In his debut episode, Scorpion travels to New York to prevent Iron Fist from returning to K'un-L'un to compete in the upcoming tournament that will determine who shall be the king of K'un-L'un. Disguised as a ninja, Scorpion attacks Iron Fist and Spider-Man during their training session and, after a brief battle, he manages to hit Iron Fist with a poisoned dagger, before Spider-Man webs Scorpion up to a passing truck, that drags him away. Later, when Iron Fist and Spider-Man arrive in K'un-L'un for the tournament, Scorpion attacks Spider-Man, as no outsiders are allowed in K'un-L'un, and almost kills him with his kusarigama, but Iron Fist stops him, saying that Spider-Man is his guest. Angry that the outside world has made Iron Fist soft, Scorpion prepares to battle him, but is stopped by the Master of K'un-L'un. Afterwards, when the tournament is about to begin, the poison in the dagger that hit Iron Fist begins to take effect and it temporary blinds him, preventing Iron Fist from competing. Just when Scorpion is about to be declared the winner by default, Iron Fist names Spider-Man to compete in his place and the masters agree, much to both Scorpion and Spider-Man's surprise. Although Scorpion initially refuses to compete against an outsider, he eventually agrees and he and Spider-Man enter the tournament, during which Spider-Man realizes that Scorpion is the ninja that attacked him and Iron Fist earlier. Scorpion eventually reaches what he believes to be the finish line first, where he arrogantly dons the crown and lots of goldon coins begin to rain on him, but Spider-Man realizes that it's a trap and Scorpion is actually burried alive in gold. Spider-Man decides to save Scorpion rather than finish the race, but an ungreatful Scorpion attacks him and then crosses the real finish line before him. Spider-Man believes to have lost, but the masters declare him as the winner, as he showed humility and sacrificed his position in the race to save Scorpion's life, just like a real king would have done, and then praise Iron Fist for having chosen Spider-Man as his replacement. Angry at this, Scorpion tells Iron Fist that he dishonored K'un-L'un and then attacks him, but Iron Fist manages to defeat him, despite being blind, and tells him that it's him who dishonored K'un-L'un. Defeated, Scorpion begs for mercy and claims that he was blinded by his aroggance, but the masters end up exiling him out of K'un-L'un nevertheless and Scorpion leaves for New York. Scorpion returns in the episode "Return of the Sinister Six", where he is sprung out of Ryker's Island and joins [[Doctor Octopus]]'s new "armored" [[Sinister Six]], replacing the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] from the original incarnation; Scorpion's armor resembles Mac Gargan's costume from the comics, as it gives him giant lobster-like claws for hands and a mechanical scorpion attached to his back, except that, like all the other armors, it is grey. During the battle between the armored Sinister Six and Spider-Man, the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] trainees, and [[Norman Osborn|Iron Patriot]], Scorpion fights Iron Fist and then helps with the attack on Iron Patriot, but is eventually defeated by Spider-Man. Scorpion later builds himself a new green armor, lacking the lobster claws, and is briefly seen in the season 3 episode "Agent Venom", where, following the battle between the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]'s army of [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]-infected aliens in the previous episode, a piece of the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote has escaped and attached to Scorpion (a reference to the fact that Mac Gargan has been Venom in the comics). While looking for the missing piece of the symbiote through the city, Spider-Man is attacked by the symbiote-infected Scorpion. During their battle, [[Flash Thompson]] tries to help out Spider-Man while dressed as "[[Scarlet Spider]]", but he only endangers himself, forcing Spider-Man to constantly save Flash. Spider-Man eventually defeats Scorpion and removes the symbiote off him, but the symbiote later attaches to Flash instead, turning him into the superhero Agent Venom. In the episode "New Warriors", Scorpion is one of the escaped supervillains, alongside Doctor Octopus, Beetle, and the Green Goblin, during the battle between [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]'s [[Thunderbolts (comics)|team]] and Spider-Man's [[New Warriors]]. Along with his fellow supervillains - except for Green Goblin - Scorpion is eventually defeated by the New Warriors and imprioned back on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier|Tri-carrier]]. Scorpion makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the episode "Contest of Champions" Part 1, where he is seen as a pawn in the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]'s collection. In the two-part series finale "Graduation Day", Scorpion joins Doctor Octopus' "Superior Sinister Six", alongside [[Kraven the Hunter]], a mind-controlled [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], a mind-controlled [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], and a mind-controlled [[Crossbones (comics)|Corssbones]] (whom Scorpion injects with a lizard DNA serum to transform him into the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]); Doctor Octopus has also upgraded Scorpion's armor, allowing him to turn invisible, and revealed him Spider-Man's secret identity. Scorpion and Lizard-Crossbones are defeated by Spider-Man and his team inside one of Doctor Octopus' old labs and imprisoned at the [[Triskelion]] alongside the rest of the Superior Sinister Six, but they all break out and take over the Triskellion, imprisoning everyone inside a dome, except for Spider-Man, whom Doctor Octopus injects with a serum strips of his super-powers. However, Spider-Man manages to escape from the Triskellion and arrives at [[Oscorp]], where Norman Osborn helps him get his powers back, despite the Superior Sinister Six bringing down the entire building in their attempt to stop. Spider-Man then battles the Superior Sinister Six and manages to defeat Scorpion and Kraven, turn Vulture, Rhino and Lizard-Crossbones back to their human forms and free them from the mind-control, and redeem Doctor Octopus. In the aftermath, the Sinister Six are disbanded for good, with Scorpion and Kraven most likely being imprisoned back in the Triskellion.

It is also explained that Oscorp physicist [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] made Scorpion by infusing a [[black fat–tailed scorpion]] with human DNA and "[[Symbiote (comics)|black goo]]"; Octavius calls his Scorpion creation by the name of "M.A.C." (My Astonishing Creation). Scorpion is the first of the cross-species to go bersek after he senses Peter Parker's (Spider-Man's alter ego) spider DNA during  a tour with [[Gwen Stacy]], and, alongside the other cross-species, escapes from Oscorp, infecting numerous civilians and causing chaos to slowly ensue in the city. Scorpion fights Spider-Man when he returns to Oscorp, but he defeats him and leaves him webbed up on the floor. Scorpion later escapes from Oscorp again and attacks a construction worker at the docks, but Spider-Man battles him once again and defeats him, before he is taken in by the police.
