==Fictional character biography==
Robert "Buzz" Baxter was born in Centerville, California. He and Patsy Walker were high school sweethearts, and got married shortly after graduation. After high school, he joined the [[United States Air Force|USAF]], serving in the [[Vietnam War]], eventually earning the rank of [[colonel]].<ref>''Avengers'' #144</ref> He later became the security consultant to the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]]. He began an investigation of the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'s appearances at the Brand Corporation.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' vol. 2 #13</ref> While he was working for Brand, he and Patsy grew distant and got divorced. Baxter had the [[Squadron Supreme]] capture the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and held them prisoner at a Brand facility. Baxter confronted his ex-wife Patsy, and was forced by Hellcat to release the Avengers from Brand captivity.<ref>''Avengers'' #141–142, 149</ref>

Baxter later allowed [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]], the company to which Brand was a subsidiary, to experiment on him and mutate him. As '''Mad-Dog''', he became a [[mercenary]], and directed [[Resistants|Mutant Force]]. He invaded the wedding of [[Daimon Hellstrom]] and Patsy Walker to abduct Patsy and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He was defeated by Daimon Hellstrom, and placed in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody along with Mutant Force. However, he escaped with Mutant Force.<ref>''Defenders'' #125–126</ref> He became an agent of the third [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]. As security chief, he aided the Secret Empire and its leader, [[Professor Power]], in an attempt to start World War III. Together with Mutant Force, he battled and was defeated by the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' #129–130</ref>

Much later, Mad-Dog abducted and intended to kill Hellcat, but was defeated by her.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #9</ref> He joined [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] and other costumed criminals in an attack on [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #22–25</ref> He also unsuccessfully attacked the [[Fantastic Four]] during the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]."<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #335</ref>

In [[Toronto]], Baxter was caught up in the violent influence of the release of the Sk'ar. He fought [[Gamma Flight]], but was teleported away by [[Manikin (comics)|Manikin]]'s future self.<ref>''Alpha Fight'' #111</ref> [[Roxxon]] hired him and [[Angar the Screamer|Angar]] to lead a group of operatives in a twofold mission: infiltrate and destroy [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. The villains stormed the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]], but the new Super-Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. eventually defeated Baxter and other villains.<ref>''Nick Fury: Agent of SHIELD'' #32–35</ref> He fought [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], as the first of five competitors at a super-villain convention on Boca Caliente and was quickly defeated.<ref>''Captain America'' #411</ref>  He was later present when [[Captain America]], [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Shang-Chi]] battled numerous villains on the island.<ref>''Captain America'' #412–414</ref> He next worked with [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], when was sent to test the skills of Siren, an [[Ultraverse]] resident on [[Earth-616]].<ref>''Siren Infinity'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mad-Dog gained superhuman powers as a result of bionic engineering and cellular augmentation by the Roxxon Mutagenic Department and by the third [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]. Baxter was given superhuman strength and endurance, and superhumanly acute animal-like senses, particularly hearing and smell.  He also possesses bionically strengthened jaw muscles, and has been given large hollow, fang-like canine teeth. His teeth can emit a foaming chemical poison, to which he himself is immune, which can induce paralysis and possibly death if it enters a victim's bloodstream through Mad-Dog's bite.  However, the process which gave Mad Dog his powers also gave him insanity which clouds his judgment and behavior.

He now possesses a large animalistic appearance, with pointed ears, claws on both his hands and feet, and a coat of fur on his limbs and torso.{{issue|date=September 2016}}

Robert Baxter has received combat training from the U.S. Air Force.
