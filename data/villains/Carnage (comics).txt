'''Carnage''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' No. 359. Carnage was created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Mark Bagley]], however the first published artwork of Carnage was penciled by [[Chris Marrinan]]. The character belongs to a race of amorphous [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Parasitism|parasites]] known as the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiotes]]. The Carnage symbiote is usually depicted as an offspring of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].  The symbiote has taken many hosts. The original and most notable host is serial killer '''[[Cletus Kasady]]'''. Other hosts include [[Karl Malus]] and [[Norman Osborn]].

== Publication history ==
The Carnage symbiote was derived by writer [[David Michelinie]] while [[Mark Bagley]] designed the Carnage symbiote. The symbiote was designed to be a darker version of Venom and was created due to the writers not wanting a replacement for [[Eddie Brock]] as Venom. Carnage was in part created due to Venom's immense popularity with fans. The character was originally meant to be named "Chaos"<ref>''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' Spider-Man Special, pg. 45</ref> and then "Ravage" before being settled on "Carnage".

== Hosts ==
=== Cletus Kasady ===
{{Main|Cletus Kasady}}
When [[Eddie Brock]]'s [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] soon returned to be bonded again, allowing Venom to escape prison, the symbiote left its offspring in the cell; due to its alien mindset, the symbiote felt no emotional attachment to its offspring, regarding it as insignificant, and thus never communicated its existence to Brock via their telepathic link. The new symbiote then bonded with Brock's cellmate [[Cletus Kasady]] through a cut on his hand, transforming him into Carnage.<ref name="ASM 344-345">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344–345</ref> The bond between the Carnage symbiote and Kasady was stronger than the bond between Brock and the Venom symbiote. Cletus Kasady was also a serial killer and thought of as insane. As a result, Carnage is far more violent, powerful, and deadly than Venom.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Kasady and the symbiote would then be a main antagonist in "[[Maximum Carnage]]" and Kasady would continually be the most recurring character to use the Carnage symbiote in many publications.<ref name="Venom #1-4">Venom #1-4</ref>
<ref name="CarnageFF">''Carnage'' #1–5</ref>

=== Spider-Carnage (Ben Reilly) ===
{{Main|Ben Reilly}}
It eventually transferred itself to Spider-Man—[[Ben Reilly]] at the time—when Ben bonded with it in order to prevent it from hurting any innocent people, creating Spider-Carnage. Ben's willpower held out against the symbiote's murderous desires long enough for him to return it to Ravencroft. Reilly subsequently attempted to destroy the symbiote by subjecting himself to a potentially lethal blast of microwaves, but it escaped back to Kasady after the microwaves forced it to separate from him.<ref name="Spider-Carnage">''Sensational Spider-Man'' No. 3, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 410, ''Spider-Man'' No. 67, and ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' No. 233</ref>

=== Superior Carnage (Karl Malus) ===
{{Main|Karl Malus}}
After Kasady was lobotomized, he was broken out of prison by the [[Wizard (comics)|Wizard]] and [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], who intend to recruit him into the Frightful Four and turn him into their own version of Venom. After a failed attempt to control Kasady, Wizard transfers the Symbiote to Dr. [[Karl Malus]]. Dr. Malus was enraged and under the influences of the Symbiote tried to kill his teammates, but he was subdued by Klaw and controlled by Wizard, who renames him "Superior Carnage" and equips him with weapons.<ref name="SupCar">''Superior Carnage'' #1–5</ref>

The trio are confronted by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] and during their battle the Wizard loses his control over Carnage and he is fatally injured once Spider-Man accidentally drops him due to the shock of finding out Wizard read his mind and knows about Otto Octvaius. Carnage, now free, goes on a rampage and starts to kill anyone in front of him. Klaw tries to stop him, but due to his weapon being damaged he fails and realizes that the only way is for the Wizard to take back control. Both Carnage and Klaw make their way outside. Carnage fights the Superior Spider-Man and admits that although he liked using weapons, for him ripping and slashing the bodies is better. Klaw tries to get the Wizard to control Carnage again, but is killed by Carnage and the explosion separates the Symbiote from its host, only to bond with the injured Wizard.<ref name="SupCar" />

=== Red Goblin (Norman Osborn) ===
{{Main|Norman Osborn}}
Following the events of ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'', the Carnage symbiote was stolen from an old S.H.I.E.L.D. storehouse by the then-powerless [[Norman Osborn]].<ref name="ASM 794">''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 794</ref> He initially found himself overwhelmed by the symbiote's desire for mindless slaughter when he allowed it to merge with him,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 795</ref> but he has been able to 'persuade' the symbiote to let him take control of Carnage's powers to show it something other than 'boring' mindless slaughter.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 796</ref> Using this combination of powers during the "[[Go Down Swinging (comic book)|Go Down Swinging]]" storyline, Norman is easily able to tear through [[Human Torch]], [[Clash (comics)|Clash]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]], [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], and [[Anti-Venom (Marvel Comics)|Agent Anti-Venom]], with the combination of the symbiote and the Goblin serum rendering Carnage immune to its traditional weaknesses, eventually transferring part of the symbiote to his grandson Normie enough to turn him into a miniature version of Red Goblin.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 799</ref> The Carnage symbiote is seemingly destroyed by Spider-Man when he hits it with an exploding gas tank, however, because the symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe's mind. Later as Spider-Man visits Norman in Ravencroft, it's revealed that Norman's mind appears to have been completely fried and now believes that Spider-Man is actually Norman Osborn and he is Cletus Kasady. It's not clear whether or not he's faking it or if he had actually lost his mind. Meanwhile, Harry manages to remove the Carnage symbiote from Normie. Not all of it has gone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 800</ref>

=== Other hosts ===
There have been other, shorter term hosts for the symbiote.

==== John Jameson ====
{{Main|John Jameson (comics)}}
Though bonded to Kasady's bloodstream the symbiote found a way to ditch its host by travelling through the Ravencroft Institute's water pipes overwhelming Ravencroft's chief, John Jameson. Carnage used him to commit further murders before eventually bonding with Spider-man, who was Ben Reilly at the time.<ref name="Spider-Carnage" />

==== Carnage Cosmic (Norrin Radd) ====
{{Main|Silver Surfer}}
During a subsequent rampage, the Carnage symbiote briefly attempted to take control of the [[Silver Surfer]], who was visiting Earth at the time to welcome the [[Fantastic Four]] after their return to life following the battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. As it turned out, [[Galactus]] had consumed a planet that many Symbiotes lived on, and the species had made it a race memory so that each future Symbiote could remember it, as well as the Surfer who had been Galactus's herald at the time. Upon seeing the Silver Surfer, the Carnage Symbiote abandoned Kasady and bonded with the Silver Surfer, becoming the Carnage Cosmic. Spider-Man and the Surfer managed to return the Symbiote to Kasady, who was dying from stomach cancer, and then the Silver Surfer proceeded to seal both host and Symbiote in an unbreakable prison in an attempt to force him to reflect on his sins for eternity.<ref name="ASM 430-431">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430–431</ref>

==== Scorn (Tanis Nevies) ====
{{Main|Scorn (Marvel Comics)}}
After Carnage was ripped in half by the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] outside the Earth atmosphere<ref name="The Avengers 1-2">''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #1–2</ref> it is later discovered that, although the host was presumably killed, the symbiote survived by becoming dormant and returned to Earth, where it was discovered by Michael Hall, a competitor of [[Tony Stark]]. He brought [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] and her doctor, Tanis Nevies, so he could use Shriek to keep the symbiote alive in order of using the properties of the symbiote, to create prosthetic limbs and exo-suits which respond in the same ways as a symbiote. One such person, Dr. Tanis Nieves, is outfitted with one of these prosthetic arms after she is caught in an attack by the [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]], who tried to rescue Shriek.<ref name="CarnageFF">''Carnage'' #1–5</ref> When near the symbiote, her arm goes wild and forces her to kill several scientists before the symbiote forcefully bonds to her, becoming the new Carnage.<ref name="CarnageFF" /> After the symbiote uses Tanis to break into a Hall Corporation facility, it is revealed that Kasady is alive (although both of his legs have been severed), his body preserved by the symbiote and repaired by Hall's prosthetics.<ref name="CarnageFF" /> Kasady reclaims the symbiote and becomes Carnage once more, attempting to avenge his captivity while Spider-Man and Iron Man struggle to stop him. It is then revealed that Carnage was once again pregnant, and the suit's spawn briefly bonds to Tanis, but she removes it from herself and the symbiote bonds to Shriek before being torn from her. Scared of Shriek's malice, the symbiote arm then rebonds to Tanis, creating a new hero, Scorn, who defeats Shriek and forces her to use her sonic shriek to weaken Carnage, but he escapes.<ref name="CarnageFF" />

==== Wizard (Bentley Wittman) ====
Ultimately, Spider-Man brings out Kasady's body to successfully draw the symbiote into it, which immediately devours Dr. Malus and then prepares to finish off the Wizard. However, Klaw ephemeral spirit focuses his sound manipulation powers one last time for a split second to create a powerful sonic blast that disables Carnage, allowing the symbiote to be recaptured. In the epilogue it is shown that the symbiote has managed to repair the Wizard's and Kasady's brain damage.<ref name="SupCar" />

==== Carla Unger ====
After the symbiote had died in captivity, a sample of the symbiote was being examined by Dr. Carla Unger, until the sample entered into her body. When she went home, the symbiote formed around her and then she with the symbiote killed her abusive husband. After that, the symbiote consumed her and went to other hosts to get back to Kasady. When the symbiote arrived to an injured Kasady, a scientist, who wanted the symbiote for himself tried to kill Kasady, but the symbiote rebonded to Cletus.<ref>''Superior Carnage Annual'' No. 1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==== Goblin Childe (Normie Osborn) ====
{{Main|Normie Osborn}}

== Powers and abilities ==
{{Main|Symbiote (comics)#Biology}}
As Eddie Brock explained,<ref name="ASM 362">The Amazing Spider-Man No. 362</ref> the Carnage symbiote was born with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor—due to the fact that it gestated in an environment alien to it—[[Earth]]. The alien symbiote endows Kasady with physical strength greater than that of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] combined<ref name="ASM 362" /> and shape-shifting abilities, allows him to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables him to plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote [[tendril]].<ref name="Carnage: Mind Bomb">''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' one-shot</ref> Much like Spider-Man, Kasady has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has a version of Spider-Man's spider-sense, as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to "see" in any direction, warning him of incoming threats.<ref name="ASM 361">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #361</ref><ref name="SMU 2">''Spider-Man Unlimited #2''</ref> He can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick surfaces. The Carnage symbiote has abilities similar to that of Spider-Man as a direct result of the Venom symbiote's first host, Peter Parker, who transferred some of Spider-Man's power into the symbiote.

He is able to regenerate damaged body tissues much faster and more extensively than that of an ordinary human. This has been shown as powerful enough to allow him to regenerate from decapitation.<ref name="Venom Vol 2 #27">''Venom Vol 2 #27''</ref><ref name="AXIS: Carnage #3">''AXIS:Carnage #3''</ref> However, after being torn in half by the Sentry, he was fitted with artificial legs, but this occurred while he was separated from the symbiote.<ref name="CarnageFF" /> Kasady is also immune to the effects of all Earthly diseases and infections as long as he remains bonded with the symbiote. Like Venom, the symbiote is vulnerable to sound (to a much smaller degree than Venom) and heat (to a much larger degree than Venom),<ref name="Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004">''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man'', 2004</ref> and is undetectable to Spider-Man's spider-sense. Unlike Venom, Carnage can launch parts of his symbiote at enemies in the form of solid weapons such as darts, spears, knives, axes, etc., although they disintegrate into dust within ten seconds of leaving Carnage's body.<ref name="ASM 361" /> Carnage also has the unique ability to warp his appendages into different arms, legs, and even wings. This is shown on several occasions when Carnage mutates his fingers and arms into what look like large swords.

Kasady has full control over the size, shape, color (usually red and black), texture, and hardness of his symbiote (and any part thereof). Like Venom, he can make his symbiote look like normal clothing (which he has done on rare occasion), or act as "camouflage". With the symbiote bonded to his bloodstream, he can "regenerate" his costume from scratch simply by bleeding. His symbiote has the peculiar ability to block its parent's ([[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]'s) ability to sense and track it.<ref name="Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004" /> The symbiote is also able to rapidly adapt to new environments: when Kasady was taken into space by the Sentry,<ref name="New Avengers 1-2">''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #1–2</ref> the Carnage symbiote was able to save his life by growing small sacks around his mouth that converted carbon dioxide into oxygen, allowing Kasady to stay alive long enough for him to be recovered.<ref name="CarnageFF" />

In some interpretations, the Carnage symbiote is [[Vampire|vampiric]], feeding on and thus endangering his victims by only a mere touch.<ref name="New Avengers 1-2" /> The symbiote has also shown the ability to call parts of itself back to the main symbiote, reintegrating them. It can also send irresistible commands to parts of itself that are in technology; these were used to break the bones of the Iron Rangers when they challenged Carnage while wearing symbiote-enhanced technological exo-suits. Using these last two abilities, Carnage absorbed the five Iron Rangers, grew to an enormous size, and became blue.<ref name="CarnageFF" />

Finally, Carnage's powers have always been abnormally enhanced from the maniacal will and insane worldview that Kasady has had from the age of 8 years old.<ref name="SM 36">''Spider-Man'' No. 36</ref> Kasady sees chaos and random, undirected violence as reality, and considers order and virtue to be illusions.<ref name="ASM 361-363">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #361–363</ref> He takes an almost artistic pride in his mayhem,<ref name="ASM 430-431" /> likes to leave a trail for others to follow (usually leaving the phrase "Carnage Rules" written in his own blood), and is recklessly willing to take on the most dangerous and powerful opponents and victims.<ref name="ASM 361-363" /> On rare occasions, however, he has deliberately spared individuals to serve as witnesses for others: for instance, [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joe Robertson]]'s wife Martha during ''Savage Rebirth''.<ref name="ASM 430">''Amazing Spider-Man'' No. 430</ref> Kasady is essentially taking revenge on the whole world for the torments, both real and imagined, of his childhood.<ref name="SM 36" /><ref name="SM & B 1">''Spider-Man and Batman'' No. 1</ref>

When the Carnage symbiote was joined with Norman Osborn, the resulting combination was immune to traditional symbiote weaknesses of sound and fire, although Anti-Venom's touch was still dangerous.

== Other versions ==

=== Exiles ===
The Earth-15 psychotic Peter Parker and Carnage combine to become the "'''Spider'''", and becomes a member of [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#Weapon X|Weapon X]] in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''.<ref name="Exiles 13">''Exiles'' No. 12</ref> He is killed when [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)#Exiles|Firestar]] explodes from her powers.<ref>''Exiles'' No. 44.</ref>

=== MC2 ===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] future timeline, Carnage, also known as '''Specimen 297''', bonds with [[Spider-Girl]]'s friend '''Moose Mansfied''', who wanted to use the symbiote to cure his father from cancer.<ref name="ASG 9">''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #9–12</ref> He also infects Spider-Girl's [[Benjamin Richard Parker|little brother]], turning him into a miniature version of himself. Spider-Girl uses the sonic blasters of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]] to destroy all traces of the symbiote.

In a later timeline, samples of the symbiote are used to create '''Biopreds''', living weapons that the government use to try to stop ''Mayhem'', Spider-Girl's part-symbiote clone, who, after killing the real Spider-Girl, became a murderous vigilante, eventually killing the hero [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]. The Biopreds run wild, however, decimating the world and its defenders. Mayhem, seeing the error of her ways, goes back in time and sacrifices herself to stop her past self from killing Spider-Girl, ensuring the events that led to the Biopreds' creation never occurred.<ref name="SG: The End">''Spider-Girl: The End''</ref>

=== Ultimate Marvel ===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Carnage is a self-regenerating vampiric organism. This version is created from DNA samples of both [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) and the [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Lizard]], and combined with samples from [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]]'s [[Alternative versions of Venom#Ultimate Marvel|symbiotic suit research]].
When first introduced, the organism was a blob of instinct, with no intelligence or self-awareness, with its only aim to feed on the DNA of others, including [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]], to stabilize itself. After feeding on multiple people, Carnage turns into a damaged form of Richard. Carnage and Peter battle to which Peter throws Carnage into a fire factor steel chimney, killing the beast. But before its death, the organism splintered into a replica of Gwen's form.<ref name="USM 128">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' No. 128</ref><ref name="USM Images">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRLD0R5aWfI&t=58s |title=best apps , Wikis, Cheats, Walkthroughs, Reviews, News & Videos&nbsp;– IGN |publisher= |via=YouTube}}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' No. 98 "Gwen" appears to have no memory of her "death" and believes she was in a hospital, from which she has escaped. In issue No. 100, after a raft of revelations, the stress of the situation enrages "Gwen". She transforms into Carnage before leaping out the window.{{issue|date=July 2013}} In the next issue, "Richard Parker" claims "Gwen" should not have met Peter at all, and was merely an experiment in [[stem cell research]]. This Gwen/Carnage fights with the [[Fantastic Four#Ultimate Marvel|Fantastic Four]], [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]], and the [[Spider-Slayer#Ultimate Marvel|Spider-Slayers]] drones, until she is knocked unconscious by a beam of light, and taken into custody. In issue No. 113, Norman Osborn as the [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Green Goblin]] causes a massive prison break from the [[Triskelion (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Triskelion]]. An inmate appearing to be 'Gwen' walks out amidst the chaos, disappearing in the shadows. It has been revealed the creature posing as Gwen Stacy is still the original Ultimate Carnage Spider-Man faced earlier in its run. After "devouring" Gwen, this incarnation of Carnage has gone on to mimic her "essence" and now believes itself to be Gwen Stacy.{{dead link|date=August 2013}}<ref>[https://ignitista.com "Ultimate Spider-Man Pictures Full Size"]. [[IGN]].</ref>

During the "War of the Symbiotes" storyline, Gwen/Carnage's back story in the Triskelion is revealed. It is shown Gwen has been taking some form of therapy with [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Tony Stark]]. However, when the Green Goblin broke out of the Triskelion, Gwen escaped and went to Peter Parker's old house in a confused and terrified state, with Carnage's face on her body. During an exchange between Peter and Gwen, Eddie Brock attempts to attack Aunt May and retake his symbiote. In a rage, Spider-Man engages Eddie on a nearby rooftop. During the fight, Gwen is shown to be able to use her symbiote to fight off Eddie, but Eddie's symbiote reconstitutes itself upon contact with Carnage and absorbs the symbiote, rendering Gwen an ordinary girl.

=== Marvel 1602 ===
On [[Marvel 1602|Earth-311]], '''Canice Cassidy''' believed that he was bonded to a demon and formed the universe's version of [[Sinister Six#Marvel 1602 Spider-Verse|Sinister Six]] called Sinister Sextet with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], Karnov (Earth-411's version of [[Kraven the Hunter]]), Magus (Earth-311's version of [[Mysterio]]), and Serpent (who is similar to [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]) as its members. The dimension-hopping Web-Warriors who aid dimensions (who lost its Spider-Man) defeated Sinister Sextet, and as they round up their captives, they notice that Electro escaped, unbeknownst to the group, followed them to the Great Web.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 No. 1</ref>

=== Venomverse ===
In ''[[Venomverse]]'', when Venom and Eddie Brock from Prime Earth were recruited into a war between lethal protectors from across the multiverse and the symbiote-eating Poisons, the Venoms from the multiverse were on the ropes until Eddie had the bright idea to recruit the psychopath Carnage to their side. They summoned a Carnage that hailed from a world where he had succeeded in killing Venom, and while he was volatile at first, engaging in battle with the Resistance, when he realized he had the opportunity to fight "a buncha messed-up super-heroes" he decided to join the Venoms.<ref>''Venomverse'' No. 3</ref> For some reason, Carnage was immune to the Poisons, and he helped tip the scales in their favor as one last ditch suicide run and was left for dead alongside Poison Deadpool, and was seemingly killed when the Hive's ship was destroyed, after the heroes were sent back to their respective dimensions.<ref>''Venomverse'' No. 5</ref>

[[File:Carnage in Spider-Man The Animated Series.jpg|thumb|right|Carnage (Cletus Kasady) in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'']]
* The Carnage symbiote appears in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' and bonds with [[Cletus Kasady]] (voiced by [[Scott Cleverdon]]) and [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Carnage]] (voiced by [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]]). Its original host appeared in the episodes "Venom Returns", "Carnage" and "The Haunting of Mary Jane Watson". This version was never shown killing anyone but still a deranged psychopath with a heavy criminal record. Cletus is captured by the police after planning to explode a bomb over New York. In prison, he shares a cell with [[Eddie Brock]]. After the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote goes in their prison and rebonds with Brock and escapes, [[Baron Mordo]] appears in front of Cletus and explains that another symbiote has the same symbiotic powers. When Mordo makes a deal with this symbiote power in exchange for servitude to [[Dormammu]], Cletus accepts the offer and bonds with the new symbiote, turning into Carnage and escapes the prison. Carnage and Venom are given vampiric powers to steal life energy so that Dormammu can escape into this dimension and consume. Carnage mockingly refers to Venom as Dad. Carnage abducts [[Ashley Kafka]], resulting in Venom teaming up with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Iron Man]]. After the final showdown, Carnage tried to drag Ashley into Dormammu's realm with him, but Eddie sacrificed himself to save Ashley and falls through the portal with Carnage. Carnage, Venom and Dormammu are ultimately imprisoned in Dormammu's dimension. In the series finale, its second host appeared as Spider-Carnage.

Created by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]], the Carnage symbiote envelops [[Doctor Octopus]] as a host after Morbius is injected with Doc Ock's vampire bat serum, eventually being separated by Spider-Man and [[Flash Thompson]]. Upon gaining its own sentience as a hostless symbiote, Carnage fights with Spider-Man and Agent Venom which results in a symbiote bomb to spread to possesses multiple hosts (such as the [[Hulk]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]]) until the [[Anti-Venom (Marvel Comics)|Anti-Venom]] symbiote ultimately neutralized Carnage's swarm. However, Carnage's regenerated in a giant form which turned in a hive that Spider-Man, Agent Venom and Patrioteer fought through in order to find the [[Mary Jane Watson|Carnage Queen]] in the center.

=== Video games ===
* The Cletus Kasady version of Carnage was a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss character]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (1992 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' (1992), ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'', ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage]]'', ''[[Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' (2000) (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]).
** In the 2000 ''Spider-Man'' video game, Carnage (Cletus Kasady) is helping [[Doctor Octopus]] with his plan to infest New York with symbiotes, which are cloned from Carnage's symbiote. Carnage serves as the game's penultimate boss and is fought immediately after defeating Doc Ock. After Spider-Man defeats Carnage using sonics, the symbiote attaches to Doctor Octopus instead, turning him into an out-of-control monster called '''[[Doctor Octopus|Monster-Ock]]''', which serves as the game's final boss. Monster Ock is too powerful to be fought directly, so Spider-Man is forced to run away from him through the underwater base. After a long chase, Monster Ock ends up destroying the entire base and is caught in the explosion, which removes the symbiote off Doctor Octopus.
* The Ultimate Marvel iteration of the Carnage symbiote appears as the penultimate boss in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game. Unlike the Ultimate Marvel comics, this version of Carnage requires a host to survive rather than being an entity of its own, in this case the host being Peter Parker, and is created by [[Bolivar Trask|Trask]] Industries as a replacement for the Venom symbiote, after they were unable to remove it from its host, Eddie Brock. When scientist [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes]] injects Peter with this makeshift sample of the symbiote, Carnage is born as a much more aggressive, out-of-control, and unstoppable symbiote than Venom, which escapes to wreck havoc in the Trask Industries building, knocking Toomes unconscious in the process. After Carnage arrives in the room that Eddie is being held captive, he transforms into Venom and escapes as well, fighting Carnage through the building. After defeating Carnage, Venom absorbs the symbiote off Peter and the combination between the two suits gives Eddie complete control over the Venom symbiote, symbolized by a white spider emblem appearing on Venom's chest.
* The Cletus Kasady version of Carnage appears as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'' voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He is exclusive to the [[PlayStation Portable]] version of the game, but is still alluded at the end of all versions, when [[Nick Fury]] decides to call the study of the meteor shards responsible for all the events in the game "Project Carnage".
* The Ultimate Marvel iteration of Carnage appears as a villain in the final Ultimate segment in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced again by Fred Tatasciore.<ref name="SM: Shattered Dim Prev">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/22/sdcc-10-spider-man-shattered-dimensions-preview|title=SDCC 10: Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions Preview|first=Greg|last=Miller|date=21 July 2010|publisher=}}</ref> Derived from [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]]'s DNA and the Venom symbiote, Carnage is an entity of its own, without a host, similar to the Ultimate Marvel comics. Carnage has been captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and brought to the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] along with a fragment from the Tablet of Order and Chaos, but S.H.I.E.L.D. foolishly making experiments on Carnage with the fragment behind [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]]’s back allowed the symbiote to absorb it, which increased his powers to new levels. After escaping from his containment, Carnage used his new powers to drain the life from numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, which then reanimated into his mindless zombie minions (which slowly mutate into symbiote creatures like itself). After receiving an emergency call about what has happened, Spider-Man arrives at the Triskellion, which is now under Carnage's control and swarming with zombie agents, and pursues Carnage throughout the base's burning ruins, along the way dealing with the villain's numerous spawns and [[Spider-Slayer]]s armed with flamethrowers (which identify Spider-Man as a threat due to the use of the Venom symbiote suit). Cornering Carnage in his nest, which is located on the Triskelion's highest floor, Spider-Man fights him and his spawns with help from several reprogrammed Spider-Slayers and finally defeats the symbiote, leaving it pinned under rubble, while he claims the tablet fragment. During the credits, Carnage is shown posing for pictures in prison.
* The Cletus Kasady version of Carnage appears as the final boss in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' voiced by David Agranov. Kasady first appears as a serial killer known as the "Carnage Killer", who is murdering other criminals; it is later revealed that Kasady was released from prison by [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] to go on a killing spree and terrorize the citizens of New York, so that they would support his plans to redevelop the city. After Kasady murders [[Burglar (comics)|Dennis Carradine]], Spider-Man begins working with [[Kraven the Hunter]] (who is secretly working for Fisk to take down his rivals, including Kasady, whose killing spree has begun interfering with Fisk's plans) to track him down and they eventually confront him just as he was preparing to kill a civilian. Kasady claims that he and Spider-Man are very alike and fights him, but Spider-Man ultimately defeats him, although he refuses to kill Kasady after Kraven urges him to, leading to his arrest and imprisonment at Ravencroft, where he becomes the test subject of an experiment funded by Fisk that has Kasady injected with a red liquid substance code-named "Venom", which was initially meant to cure [[Norman Osborn]]'s illness. The experiment eventually gets out of control and allows Kasady to control the symbiote that he was injected with. Now calling himself "Carnage", he escapes and wrecks havoc at Ravencroft, infecting numerous other patients with his symbiote. When Spider-Man comes to investigate, he fights through the infected patients and eventually confronts Kasady. Despite being defeated by Spider-Man once again, Kasady fully bonds with the symbiote and becomes Carnage, serving as the final boss in the game. Spider-Man is able to defeat Carnage using fire, one of the symbiote's only known weaknesses besides sonics, and burns the symbiote off Kasady; he begs Spider-Man to let him die, but the hero refuses, saying that him and Kasady are very different and that he needs to face justice for his crimes. In the end, Kasady is returned to his cell, where the symbiote is completely removed off him.
* The Carnage symbiote appears as a playable character in the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' mobile game via various hosts, most notably Cletus Kasady as "Carnage", and Ben Reilly as "Spider-Carnage".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Carnage also serves as a boss in the limited time Symbiote World event.
* The Carnage symbiote appears as a playable character in many Marvel related games via its most notable host Cletus Kasady.

** The Carnage symbiote appears (in various forms) in ''Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2''.<ref name="comicbook.com" /><ref name="flickeringmyth.com" /> When Spider-Man, [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]], [[She-Hulk]], [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]] and [[Spider-Man 2099]] break into [[Alchemax]], the heroes start to fight scientists who have become possessed by the symbiotes of both Carnage and Venom. Later, [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#2099|Green Goblin 2099]] uses a shard of the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|Nexus of All Realities]] to fuse the Venom symbiote and the Carnage symbiote into a new creature, dubbed "'''[[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Carnom]]'''" by Spider-Man, who is being controlled by the Goblin himself. Carnom fights and is defeated by the heroes, who free him from the Goblin's control. As the heroes claim the shard, Carnom starts chasing after Goblin 2099 in retaliation for its abuse. Both the original Carnage (Cletus Kasady) and Carnom are available as playable characters in the game.

=== Attractions ===
During the 2002 [[Halloween Horror Nights]], [[Universal Orlando]]'s [[Islands of Adventure]] featured a haunted maze entitled "Maximum Carnage". The maze was designed to be a trip through Carnage's hideout and contained all his henchmen and the bloody remains of various Marvel superheroes. The house was located at [[Marvel Super Hero Island]] under the scarezone "Island Under Siege". Carnage also was the icon chosen to represent that specific island for the event, as he killed all of the superheroes and took over the "island", allowing criminals, gangbangers, and villains to roam free with no regards to [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]. The event's main icon, "The Caretaker", chose him based on his disregard for life and desire to see total chaos.<ref name="Horror Nights">{{cite web|url=http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001073503/http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 October 2002|title=Hallowen Horror Nights|date=1 October 2002}}</ref><ref name="Open The Vault">[http://www.hhnvault.com/haunts/hhn12_houses.htm Open the Vault.
