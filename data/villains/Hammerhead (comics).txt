'''Hammerhead''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is primarily an enemy of [[Spider-Man]] and a member of [[organized crime]] who exists in Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]].

He is closely associated with the "Hammerhead Family", a [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime family. Hammerhead distinguishes himself from other villains in that he dresses up and acts somewhat like a gangster from the 1920s. Due to an injury he suffered, much of his skull was replaced with an unbendable steel alloy by [[Jonas Harrow]], giving his head a flattened shape.

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=October 2018}}
Hammerhead made his first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #113, and was created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]]<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 63|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Writer Gerry Conway made his first major contribution to the Spider-Man saga...a new mobster was on the rise in New York's underworld - Hammerhead.}}</ref> Conway recalled that Hammerhead "was most directly influenced by the [[Frederick Foswell|Big Man]] and the Crime-Master, who were among the first villains in ''Amazing Spider-Man''. One of the more interesting things [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee]]], [[Jack Kirby]], and, of course, [[Steve Ditko]] did was combining the two different kinds of milieus: superhero and ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', with the unusual criminal characters who had some kind of physical deformity. ... Plus, Hammerhead - I liked [the] name, and John Romita came up with an interesting look.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 7|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Hammerhead's family immigrated from the Soviet Union to Italy when he was a child. He got help from a man named The General. His father ran a garage in Toirrano, where he insisted the young man speak only in Russian, beating him severely with a mallet when he would not. Though not much is known about his life before he became an evil criminal and supervillain, he is known to have a sister.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

All the while, Hammerhead dreamed of becoming a gangster. He is eventually recruited into one of the "families" of the criminal organization known as the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] when a member oversees Hammerhead murdering a childhood bully and his girlfriend in a theater showing ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Originally a small-time hitman, Hammerhead quickly rises through the ranks of the Maggia, while hiding the fact that he is actually Russian so he can be "made". In his final test, Hammerhead is brought to his father's garage (with the Maggia apparently unaware of their relationship), where he proceeds to kill his father, while telling him in Russian that he does not truly hate him, and that he made him (Hammerhead) this way.<ref name="Extra #1">''Amazing Spider-Man EXTRA!'' #1 (July 2008)</ref>

One day, Hammerhead was found beaten, disfigured, and delirious with pain in an alley in New York City's [[Bowery]] by [[Jonas Harrow]], a surgeon who had lost his medical license due to his illegal experiments. Seeing the opportunity both to save this man's life and to redeem his reputation, Harrow operated on the gunman for three days, replacing much of his shattered skull with a strong steel alloy.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 18 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> During the surgery, the unconscious thug fixated on the only memory he retained: an image of a poster for a movie called "The [[Al Capone]] Mob", which was hanging in the alley where he lay beaten and bloodied before Harrow found him. When he recovered, the memory of the poster and its images of 1930s-era gangsters prompted Hammerhead to start a gang of his own in the style of Capone and other mobsters of the 1920s. He even dressed as if he were living in that decade. Later on,{{issue|date=December 2015}} Hammerhead's entire skull was replaced with or reinforced with some type of nearly unbreakable metal (possibly [[vibranium]] or secondary [[adamantium]]).{{issue|date=December 2017}}

A gang war broke out between Hammerhead's mob and [[Doctor Octopus]]'s criminal organization. Hammerhead was forced to flee the country due to [[Spider-Man]]'s interference.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #113-115</ref> He later had a rematch with Doctor Octopus next to an atomic breeder reactor on a remote Canadian island which caused a chain reaction, blasting Hammerhead "out of phase" with this dimension.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #130-131</ref> Some time later, he appeared as an immaterial ghost-like being to haunt Doctor Octopus. Doctor Octopus then unwittingly restored Hammerhead to his material form. Hammerhead kidnapped Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]], who was then rescued by Spider-Man as Doctor Octopus caused Hammerhead's helicopter to plummet into the Hudson River.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #157-159</ref>

Hammerhead then proposed that all Maggia "families" unite under his leadership. Wearing a strength-enhancing exoskeleton, he battled the [[Human Torch]] who then fused the exoskeleton's power pack.<ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #233</ref> Hammerhead was nearly assassinated by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s Arranger during a gang war. Hammerhead was forced out of a major role in New York City organized crime by the Kingpin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #284-288</ref>

Hammerhead then allied himself with the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] in the latter's bid to become the new crime lord of New York City. The two served as partners in a splinter group of the Maggia.<ref>''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #51</ref> Hammerhead hired [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] as a bodyguard and hitman.<ref>''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #157</ref> He hired the [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] to kill [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joe Robertson]], who posed a threat to Tombstone; the assassination attempt failed.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #161</ref> Hammerhead was kidnapped and beaten by Tombstone, who had gained superhuman powers and resented Hammerhead for not sending him to kill Joe Robertson.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #68</ref>

Hammerhead later attended a Las Vegas crime conference to divide the resources left by the Kingpin's downfall at the time.<ref>''Daredevil'' #307-309; ''Nomad'' #4-6; ''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' #46-48</ref> Around this time he participates in a multi-sided gang-war focused on the Kingpin's attempt to re-take New York City for his own.<ref>''Spider-Man: Made Men'' #1 (August 1998)</ref>

Hammerhead is a major player in underworld activities in the Marvel Universe and is highly sought after for elimination by the [[Punisher]]. He is currently one of several gang warlords struggling to control the criminal underworld in the major cities of the Eastern United States. During one of the first meetings of such warlords, Hammerhead was almost killed by the Strucker twins [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]]. This meeting was being manipulated by [[Baron Von Strucker]], the head of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. When [[Don Fortunato]] made a bid for control of the New York underworld, Hammerhead opposed him and was almost killed as a result. When every other crime lord surrendered to Fortunato and his HYDRA allies, Hammerhead went rogue, launching a raid on Fortunato's home and successfully fighting off a HYDRA attack on his own headquarters. He did have assistance from Spider-Man and [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]], however. For a time, the hero known as [[S.H.O.C.]] also assists Hammerhead. Later he was hired by [[Norman Osborn]] to be a part of the [[Sinister Twelve]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

During the events of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Hammerhead used the vacuum left by the incarceration of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to gain a greater foothold in the ranks of organized crime, attempting to organize an army of costumed villains (consisting of the [[Ani-Men]] V, [[Answer (comics)|Answer]] I, Aura, [[Bloodshed (comics)|Bloodshed]], [[Clown (comics)|Clown]], [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]] III, [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Great Gambonnos]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] II, [[Man Mountain Marko]], [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], [[Mindblast]], [[Gregory Herd|Override]], [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]], [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]], [[Slyde]], [[Trapster]], and [[Will O' The Wisp (comics)|Will O' The Wisp]]) to enforce his new criminal empire. When Slyde balked at the idea, Hammerhead had [[Underworld (comics)|Underworld]] kill him to serve as a warning to anyone who did not join up with him. The Kingpin manipulated various hero factions, most notably [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and [[Iron Man]] into breaking up Hammerhead's first convening of his army. During the conflict, Hammerhead was shot numerous times by Underworld, who was revealed to be working for Kingpin. Underworld later confronted Hammerhead while he lay in prison. Underworld then shot Hammerhead at point-blank range with adamantium bullets.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' #1 (February 2007)</ref>

The bullets, while not penetrating his skull, did cause severe trauma to his brain, resulting him in needing surgery, but the hospital he was brought to was unable to treat him. In mid-surgery however, men working for [[Mister Negative]] came in, killed the hospital staff, and took Hammerhead away. Mister Negative then has his surgeon Doctor Tramma revive Hammerhead and offers to transplant his brain into a new robotic adamantium skeleton, which Hammerhead agrees to.<ref name="Extra #1"/>

The operation is a complete success, and Hammerhead is restored to full mobility without any ill effects. He swears loyalty to Mister Negative in exchange for his restored life, and proceeds to shape a gang of lowlife thugs into an effective army for his benefactor. He then proceeds to battle Spider-Man, besting him with no effort for the first time in years. Later, he has a rematch with Spider-Man, with Spider-Man dislocating Hammerhead's hip bone.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #575</ref>

Mister Negative sends Hammerhead to help Spider-Man (who Mister Negative corrupted) take down the Hood, who launches an attack on Negative's headquarters. He blackmails H.A.M.M.E.R. director [[Norman Osborn]] into forcing the Hood to pull out of Chinatown.<ref>''Dark Reign: Mister Negative'' #2-3</ref>

Hammerhead later begins to doubt his loyalty to Mister Negative when Silvermane appears to return.{{issue|date=December 2015}} Unknown to Hammerhead, it is actually an android controlled by [[Mysterio]] to plant seeds of rebellion. Nevertheless, he flees a shootout with the Maggia when the Silvermane robot calls him a traitor. It is shown that Mister Negative had a computer chip put in Hammerhead's head to deliver an electroshock when necessary, which he promptly uses to punish him and remind him who is in charge.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Hammerhead and Mister Negative are among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team, promising them that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items for him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref>

Alongside his nephew and minions, Hammerhead formed an alliance with [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] where he sided with her gang.<ref>''Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Hammerhead has no superhuman abilities, yet his skull is now surgically reinforced with vibranium (or secondary adamantium), making his head flat on top; with this, he can charge and break through objects such as brick walls without causing any pain or damage to himself. This metal can absorb physical impacts that would otherwise fracture human bone. Hammerhead is in peak physical condition comparable to that of an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-level athlete. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant whose most dangerous tactic is charging head first like a bull toward an opponent. Hammerhead once utilized a strength-enhancing exoskeleton designed by the [[Tinkerer]].

After an assassin's adamantium bullet penetrated a part of his head not protected by his adamantium skull, Hammerhead is surgically rebuilt by [[Mister Negative]]. Breakout surgeries replace the upper half of his skeleton with an adamantium endo-skeleton (the skeleton is shown to have a network of hydraulic servomechanisms). The upper portion of his body is now superhumanly strong as a result of the additional hidden cybernetic musculature, making him able to effortlessly beat a superpowered foe such as Spider-Man. Mister Negative does not use on Hammerhead the same [[Lord Dark Wind]] bonding process, used on the similarly empowered [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]] for coating their bones in adamantium: instead he replaces Hammerhead's bones with replicas fashioned in the invulnerable metal. It is still unknown how his artificial skeleton can carry on biological functions.

The intervention of Mr. Negative also radically changed Hammerhead's personality. Hammerhead now recalls his life as Russian immigrant prior to the accident in which he adopted the 1920s gangster persona. Consequently, Hammerhead no longer speaks like a 1920s movie gangster, but instead behaves as a typical modern Russian mobster and hitman, as this was apparently his original personality prior to his head injury.

Hammerhead is highly skilled in the organization, concealment, and management of criminal enterprises. He is an effective hitman, a skilled marksman (his preferred weapon was the [[Thompson submachine gun]]), and an excellent street fighter. In his original incarnation, Hammerhead was able to hold his own against Spider-Man despite being an ordinary human by using his superhumanly durable skull as a blunt instrument. After his recent augmentation, he is now capable of grappling with and physically overpowering Spider-Man to the extent that he could eventually crush his foe.

* Hammerhead appeared in the 1980s ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[William Boyett]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Hammerhead was said to maintain crime in the mid-west. In the episode "Wrath of the Sub-Mariner", he alongside Silvermane (and his henchman Man Mountain Marko) and Caesar Cicero meet with the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] when his scientist Dr. Everett has created a dissolving fluid. He is webbed up by [[Spider-Man]].
* Hammerhead appeared in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Nicky Blair (actor)|Nicky Blair]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In this version, his head is laced with [[adamantium]]. He first appeared in the "Insidious Six" two-parter as one of [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]]'s loyal henchmen and amongst the other crime lords against the Kingpin. He was hired by Silvermane that since the Kingpin failed to kill Spider-Man, he was supposed to have the Kingpin killed. But the Kingpin used the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]], the team that failed to kill Spider-Man but managed to successfully kidnap Silvermane, however, Silvermane escaped thanks to Spider-Man. Later, Silvermane hired Hammerhead again to steal the Tablet of Time so Silvermane can get his own restored youth, as the Tablet of Time's ability was to restore youth into elderly people like Silvermane. But when Hammerhead failed due to the arrival of Spider-Man, Silvermane was enraged by Hammerhead's failure and fired him, telling him that someone new and better will be hired on his place. As a result, Hammerhead started working for the Kingpin. After [[Alistair Smythe]] (Kingpin's right-hand man) stole the Tablet of Time from Dr. Curt Connors and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] (Silvermane's new hired man) had kidnapped Connors, Hammerhead figured out Tombstone had also kidnapped [[Vanessa Fisk]] even though the Kingpin didn't know about it until Silvermane sent a note, telling about the hostage. So Hammerhead kidnapped [[Alisha Silver (comics)|Alisha Silver]] (Silvermane's daughter) before the Kingpin knew about Vanessa's kidnapping, and the Kingpin was pleased about Hammerhead's work. When Silvermane then figured out Hammerhead's betrayal and kidnapped Alisha, Silvermane and the Kingpin organized a meeting that Alistair's robot and Spider-Man had intervened. Hammerhead tried to re-kidnap Alicia but the helicopter he was kidnapping Alisha in was out of control and landed on a roof. Spider-Man then arrived and defeated Hammerhead, but Alicia then used a stun-blaster on Spider-Man, knocking out and kidnapping Spider-Man. Alistair then used his own robot again to steal the Tablet of Time from Silvermane (as Tombstone had stolen the Tablet of Time and kidnapped Dr. Conners and his wife) but when the robot was defeated, the Kingpin sent Hammerhead to retrieve the Tablet of Time. While Spider-Man was dealing with the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], Silvermane, Tombstone and Alicia, Hammerhead slipped by and stole the Tablet of Time with the good guys thinking it was destroyed in the explosion of Silvermane's building, as Alicia wanted this process to come because Alisha blamed everyone against her about her father becoming a baby (as Silvermane actually overused the Tablet of Time) and tried to kill them by blowing the building up with them inside, though all of them escaped. After Vanessa left him because of his life of crime, the Kingpin thanked Hammerhead for successfully taking the Tablet of Time but told him to get rid of it, as it has led to the destruction of his relationship with his wife. Hammerhead did do as what the Kingpin told him to - by selling it to [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes]] for the villain to put his own plans into action by the two-part second-season finale.
* Hammerhead appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[John DiMaggio]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} This incarnation is much less belligerent and more cool-headed and intelligent than he was portrayed in the original animated series. He also uses [[brass knuckles]] as weapons unlike other interpretations of the character, but retains his usual strength. His hair also is presented as being parted and joining at his forehead, as opposed to the other versions of the character, and lacks a vest under his jacket. An enforcer of the Big Man of Crime, he acts on his boss's behalf call out various forces to take out Spider-Man; first the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], then giving [[Montana (comics)|Montana]] some equipment, and finally contacting [[Norman Osborn]] to make supervillains to distract Spider-Man from the Big Man's operations. He bails Flint Marko and Alex O'Hirn out of jail only to subject the two to [[Oscorp]]'s illegal experiments that turn the criminals into the supervillains [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. Hammerhead later speaks with Osborn about the Green Goblin's interference. Hammerhead ends up kidnapped by the Goblin but is rescued by Spider-Man and the Big Man. He's later seen helping the [[Sinister Six]] and the Enforcers break out of jail and employing Sandman to steal a large oil tanker for profit. Prior to being the Big Man's henchman, Hammerhead once worked for Silvermane, and was in a romantic relationship with his ex-boss's daughter [[Silver Sable]]. He represents the Big Man in a bid organized by Oscorp to sell a chip that could produce Rhino soldiers. When Silver Sable shows to the meeting, he resents Silver Sable and tries to outbid Silver Sable only to be beaten by [[Roderick Kingsley]]. Hammerhead goes after Kingsley and Sable. But when Spider-Man and Rhino interfere, he reluctantly teams up with his ex-lover to fight Spider-Man and Rhino. He escapes police custody. Hammerhead becomes angered when the Big Man contacts the Enforcers directly and without his help. The Big Man stating being fed up with all of Hammerhead's various failures, from supervillains' creations, to the Sandman oil tanker fiasco, and the Rhino chip failure. When Hammerhead contacts Osborn in creating yet another supervillain, Osborn gives him advice that inspires him to betray the Big Man, starting by sabotaging the Enforcers' escape from the police. Hammerhead later secretly calls a Valentine's Day meeting between the Big Man, [[Doctor Octopus]] and Silvermane. There, he betrays everyone all by attacking Silver Sable and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and framing this on his boss, causing the crime lords to fight against one other. He is fired after the Big Man gets arrested. It is later revealed that Hamerhead's actions were encouraged and manipulated by the Goblin using Hammerhead to take down the Big Man.
