'''Anne Weying''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is the former wife of [[Eddie Brock]] (the second host of the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote) and mother of their son Dylan Brock. She is also the first character who goes by the '''She-Venom''' identity.

==Fictional character biography==

In Anne Weying's first appearance, she is a brunette with glasses. In later appearances, she loses the glasses and goes blonde. 

Anne was a successful [[lawyer]], and [[Eddie Brock]]'s ex-wife. Weying assisted [[Spider-Man]] by sharing some of Eddie's history. She later followed Spider-Man to the amusement park where Venom had Peter Parker's (fake) parents. She confronted her insane ex-husband, and managed to convince Eddie to give up this [[Feud|vendetta]]. Later, [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] shot Ann to which the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote temporarily bonded with her to save her life.<ref>''Venom: Sinner Takes All'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> She-Venom then lashed out against the men who had hurt her with such [[violence]] that Eddie became afraid for her and compelled the Venom symbiote back. Anne retched upon seeing the pile of bodies she had left behind; claiming that the Venom symbiote made her kill, but Eddie told her that the Venom symbiote wouldn't force its host to do something they did not want to.<ref>''Venom: Sinner Takes All'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Weying is later incarcerated by the police on a false charge (unrelated to Ann's previous rampage) in order to trap Venom. Anne used her one phone call to warn Eddie and to promise not to come. Eddie agreed not to rescue her himself, and instead sent the Venom symbiote through the phone lines to her.<ref>''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Venom symbiote bonded with her, She-Venom was able to break herself out of prison, heading to the amusement park where she and Spider-Man had confronted Venom, only to intercept a raid on a gang of drug dealers.<ref>''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the fight, Eddie was badly injured by a flamethrower, prompting Anne to release the Venom symbiote to heal but left Eddie in disgust at the dependence on the Venom symbiote.<ref>''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Still reeling from the experience of bonding with the Venom symbiote months earlier and unable to deal with Eddie's return into her life, coupled with Brock's transformation directly in front of her as Venom ran off to kill Spider-Man, sent her over the edge. Weying commits [[suicide]] after spotting Spider-Man webslinging in an older black costume at a time when the regular red and blue suit had been stolen. She leapt from her high rise apartment to her death.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her death is later confirmed when her tombstone is shown.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #22 (October 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a flashback, it is revealed that after bonding to Venom, she got pregnant with Eddie's child. After giving birth to a boy she named Dylan, she left him in the care of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: B#Carl Brock|Eddie's father]] under the promise that she would return eventually, but committed suicide instead and Carl raised Dylan as his own.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> Its later established that Anne was apparently already pregnant with Eddie's child when she last bonded with the Venom symbiote, with the codex that was left inside Anne by Venom (apparently) being absorbed by the fetus that would become Dylan.
