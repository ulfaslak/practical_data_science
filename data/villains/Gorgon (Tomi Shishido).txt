==Fictional character biography==
The Gorgon's real name is Tomi Shishido. He is a member of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] and [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] and a powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], leading the extremist mutant society Dawn of the White Light. As a child, he possessed near superhuman levels of intelligence. He said his first words at two weeks of age, could walk at three months, and was able to read and write by his first birthday. He became an accomplished painter by age four, among the top artists in all of [[Japan]]; and composed an [[opera]] at age six. This is also the age when he attempted a second [[suicide]].

At age 13, he formulated a mathematical formula that proves the existence of [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|One-Above-All]] and manifested the mutant ability to turn people to stone just by looking at them. The media dubbed him "The Gorgon", after the [[Gorgon]] of [[Greek mythology]]. Shortly after, he became the leader of a mutant death-cult called the Dawn of the White Light, which committed terrorist attacks throughout Japan. By age 18, he sought out the Hand. Before leaving his home, he killed his entire family and his only friend to prove that he was ruthless enough to join the terrorist organization.

After finding the Hand sanctuary and slaying all of its guards while blindfolded, the Gorgon went inside and pledged his allegiance to the Hand's Jonin. When the master questioned his dedication, the Gorgon impaled himself with his own sword, fatally injuring himself, and told the master to resurrect him. The Jonin were impressed and brought him into the fold.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, the Gorgon became connected to Hydra and formed a relationship with Elsbeth Von Strucker, the wife of Hydra leader [[Baron Strucker]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was responsible for the capture and brain washing of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although Wolverine was eventually freed from their control, he managed to infiltrate the [[Baxter Building]] and steal technological blueprints from [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] that were very useful to Hydra.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> Wolverine, under the brain washing, committed a number of terrorist attacks resulting in the deaths of numerous costumed heroes and hundreds of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents before he was finally caught during an assault on the X-Mansion and subsequently deprogrammed.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Eventually, the Gorgon attempted to assassinate [[Nick Fury]] after S.H.I.E.L.D. launched an attack which destroyed his safe-house and killed Elsbeth Von Strucker in the process. He was intercepted by Wolverine before he could complete the objective. The two engaged in a brutal battle, inflicting devastating injuries upon one another. The Gorgon managed to gain the upper hand and attempted to use his mutant ability to transform Wolverine into stone; Wolverine's claws were extruded at the last moment, forcing the Gorgon to see his own reflection in them. As a result, the Gorgon's power was reflected back upon him. Once the Gorgon had been turned into stone, Wolverine shattered his body.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Hydra forced The Hand to resurrect the Gorgon using the rock fragments of his body.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is also given the sword Godkiller by [[Kraken (Marvel Comics)#Daniel Whitehall|Kraken]].<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Gorgon joins up with [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] after [[Norman Osborn]] reclaims leadership upon escaping from the Raft.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gorgon ends up becoming a member of the second incarnation of the [[Dark Avengers]] as the new Dark Wolverine.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> He and [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]] secretly plan that once Osborn proves to be too dangerous to lead the Dark Avengers, they will kill Osborn and use the Dark Avengers to cause discord by serving as a voice of the "disenfranchised" unsatisfied with the status quo. Although he is generally a suitable "Dark Wolverine" due to his skills and healing powers, Gorgon lacks the real Wolverine's claws instead relying on fake claws that are a part of his costume.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gorgon and the other members of the Dark Avengers are defeated when their teammate [[Skaar (comics)|Skaar]] reveals himself as the Avengers' double-agent and summons both Avengers teams to defeat the Dark Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #23.

During the events of ''[[Avengers World]]'' Gorgon and the Hand orchestrate a full-scale riot on [[Madripoor]] as a distraction from a ritual held at their temple on the island.  Although [[Shang-Chi]] is able to infiltrate the temple, he is too late to stop the ritual, which raises the island nation out of the water up upon the head of a massive continent-sized [[Dragon|dragon]].<ref>''Avengers World'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>  While the dragon is airborne, Shang-Chi effortlessly defeats the Hand ninjas at the temple but is bested in hand-to-hand combat by the Gorgon, who throws him off the dragon several hundred feet below.<ref>''Avengers World'' #3.

S.P.E.A.R director Xian Zheng deduces that the Gorgon is flying the Mandripoorian dragon to [[Shanghai]], hoping to destroy [[China]] as a stepping stone for his empire.<ref>''Avengers World'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>  Despite S.P.E.A.R and the Ascendants best efforts, the Gorgon is able to reach Shanghai and observes from his temple while the dragon and the Hand's forces fight the Ascendants and Avengers in the city.<ref>''Avengers World'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>  However, Shang-Chi (who survived his encounter with the Gorgon and was rescued by S.P.E.A.R) uses [[Pym Particles]] supplied to him by director Zheng to grow to the size of a giant and defeats the dragon in combat. As payback for his earlier defeat and the destruction caused by the Gorgon, Shang-Chi tears off the Hand's temple (with a screaming Gorgon still trapped inside) from the dragon's head and throws it several miles away.<ref>''Avengers World'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Gorgon possesses a variety of superhuman abilities as a result of genetic mutation and mystical enhancement from the Hand and Hydra.

The Gorgon's primary mutant ability is the ability to transform an individual to stone by making eye contact with them. Gorgon's eyes have no visible pupils and glow with a bright green energy. The Gorgon always wears a pair of dark [[sunglasses]] in order to see without affecting those around him. Whether the sunglasses possess any sort of special properties or are composed of some special material designed to block his power has not been revealed.

He was also born with, or soon achieved, an extraordinary level of intelligence, possibly at a superhuman level, and psionic abilities. He possesses advanced knowledge in multiple academic and artistic fields. This intellect makes him extremely arrogant. For some reason he equates intelligence with being a mutant. For example, Gorgon dismisses Reed Richards as simply the equivalent of a [[parrot]] that can mimic a human voice, despite the fact that Gorgon was actually impressed by Richards' ideas on the plans, simply because Richards is not a mutant.

After his resurrection, the Gorgon's strength, speed, reflexes/reactions, agility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance are all heightened to superhuman levels, the exact limits of which are unrevealed. The Gorgon also possesses an accelerated healing factor that enables him to repair damaged or destroyed tissue with extraordinary speed and efficiency. He is capable of healing from massive trauma inflicted by Wolverine's [[adamantium]] claws, bludgeoning, and falling from great heights while continuing to fight.

Aside from his physical advantages, the Gorgon possesses some level of telepathy/empathy allowing him to hear the thoughts and feel the emotions of others. Much like his physical capabilities, the exact limits of the Gorgon's psionic powers remain unknown.

The Gorgon is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant, even before his resurrection, trained in multiple forms of martial arts. He is an expert swordsman and typically prefers to use a [[katana]] during combat. Also, he typically uses his psionic abilities to read the minds of his opponents during combat situations (even highly trained minds like Wolverine's and Elektra's), enabling him to predict and counter their every move. He has used swords and a personal teleportation device. He currently wields Godkiller, a sword that has killed many kings, emperors, and also made a god bleed.
