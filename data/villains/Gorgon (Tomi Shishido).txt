'''The Gorgon''' ('''Tomi Shishido''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
The Gorgon first appeared in ''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #20, and was created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[John Romita Jr.]] The character was killed in ''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #31, only to be resurrected later in ''[[Secret Warriors (2009 series)|Secret Warriors]]'' #2.

==Fictional character biography==
The Gorgon's real name is Tomi Shishido. He is a member of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] and [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] and a powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], leading the extremist mutant society Dawn of the White Light. As a child, he possessed near superhuman levels of intelligence. He said his first words at two weeks of age, could walk at three months, and was able to read and write by his first birthday. He became an accomplished painter by age four, among the top artists in all of [[Japan]]; and composed an [[opera]] at age six. This is also the age when he attempted a second [[suicide]].

At age 13, he formulated a mathematical formula that proves the existence of [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|One-Above-All]] and manifested the mutant ability to turn people to stone just by looking at them. The media dubbed him "The Gorgon", after the [[Gorgon]] of [[Greek mythology]]. Shortly after, he became the leader of a mutant death-cult called the Dawn of the White Light, which committed terrorist attacks throughout [[Japan]]. By age 18, he sought out the Hand. Before leaving his home, he killed his entire family and his only friend to prove that he was ruthless enough to join the terrorist organization.

After finding the Hand sanctuary and slaying all of its guards while blindfolded, the Gorgon went inside and pledged his allegiance to the Hand's Jonin. When the master questioned his dedication, the Gorgon impaled himself with his own sword, fatally injuring himself, and told the master to resurrect him. The Jonin were impressed and brought him into the fold.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, the Gorgon became connected to [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] and formed a relationship with Elsbeth Von Strucker, the wife of Hydra leader [[Baron Strucker]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was responsible for the capture and brain washing of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although Wolverine was eventually freed from their control, he managed to infiltrate the [[Baxter Building]] and steal technological blueprints from [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] that were very useful to Hydra.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> Wolverine, under the brain washing, committed a number of terrorist attacks resulting in the deaths of numerous costumed heroes and hundreds of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents before he was finally caught during an assault on the X-Mansion and subsequently deprogrammed.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Eventually, the Gorgon attempted to assassinate [[Nick Fury]] after S.H.I.E.L.D. launched an attack which destroyed his safe-house and killed Elsbeth Von Strucker in the process. He was intercepted by Wolverine before he could complete the objective. The two engaged in a brutal battle, inflicting devastating injuries upon one another. The Gorgon managed to gain the upper hand and attempted to use his mutant ability to transform Wolverine into stone; Wolverine extruded his claws at the last moment, forcing the Gorgon to see his own reflection in them. As a result, the Gorgon's power was reflected back upon him. Once the Gorgon had been turned into stone, Wolverine shattered his body.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Hydra forced The Hand to resurrect the Gorgon using the rock fragments of his body.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is also given the sword Godkiller by [[Kraken (Marvel Comics)#Daniel Whitehall|Kraken]].<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Godkiller is destroyed in a battle against [[Phobos (Marvel Comics)|Phobos]], who wields Grasscutter. Gorgon uses the broken blade to slay Phobos with a mortal chest stab and takes Grasscutter as his own, citing "a red sword for a red lord".<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Gorgon joins up with [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] after [[Norman Osborn]] reclaims leadership upon escaping from the Raft.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gorgon ends up becoming a member of the second incarnation of the [[Dark Avengers]] as the new Dark Wolverine.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> He and [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]] secretly plan that once Norman Osborn proves to be too dangerous to lead the Dark Avengers, they will kill him and use the Dark Avengers to cause discord by serving as a voice of the "disenfranchised" unsatisfied with the status quo. Although he is generally a suitable "Dark Wolverine" due to his skills and healing powers, Gorgon lacks the real Wolverine's claws instead relying on fake claws that are a part of his costume.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gorgon and the other members of the Dark Avengers are defeated when their teammate [[Skaar (comics)|Skaar]] reveals himself as the Avengers' double-agent and summons both Avengers teams to defeat the Dark Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Gorgon is part of the Hydra High Council that the new [[Madame Hydra]] is collecting to assist Steve Rogers, who had his history altered to be a Hydra sleeper agent for years.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Gorgon and Hive were in [[Madripoor]] at the time when the Underground arrives looking for fragments. Before being knocked down by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], Gorgon managed to turn him to stone.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Geddon]]" storyline, Arnim Zola creates a bio-duplicate of Gorgon who accompanies him and some Hydra agents to Los Angeles in order to repossess [[Doctor Octopus#Superior Octopus|Superior Octopus]]' services. The Gorgon bio-duplicate fought Superior Octopus and his blindfold-removal had him turn Superior Octopus to stone. After shattering it on Arnim Zola's orders, Superior Octopus emerged and beheaded the Gorgon bio-duplicate.<ref>''Superior Octopus'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Gorgon possesses a variety of superhuman abilities as a result of genetic mutation and mystical enhancement from the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] and [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]].

The Gorgon's primary mutant ability is the ability to transform an individual to stone by making eye contact with them. Gorgon's eyes have no visible pupils and glow with a bright green energy. The Gorgon always wears a pair of dark [[sunglasses]] in order to see without affecting those around him. Whether the sunglasses possess any sort of special properties or are composed of some special material designed to block his power has not been revealed.

He was also born with, or soon achieved, an extraordinary level of intelligence, possibly at a superhuman level, and psionic abilities. He possesses advanced knowledge in multiple academic and artistic fields. This intellect makes him extremely arrogant. For some reason he equates intelligence with being a mutant. For example, Gorgon dismisses [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] as simply the equivalent of a [[parrot]] that can mimic a human voice, despite the fact that Gorgon was actually impressed by Richards' ideas on the plans, simply because Richards is not a mutant.

After his resurrection, the Gorgon's strength, speed, reflexes/reactions, agility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance are all heightened to superhuman levels, the exact limits of which are unrevealed. The Gorgon also possesses an accelerated healing factor that enables him to repair damaged or destroyed tissue with extraordinary speed and efficiency. He is capable of healing from massive trauma inflicted by Wolverine's [[adamantium]] claws, bludgeoning, and falling from great heights while continuing to fight.

Aside from his physical advantages, the Gorgon possesses some level of telepathy/empathy allowing him to hear the thoughts and feel the emotions of others. Much like his physical capabilities, the exact limits of the Gorgon's psionic powers remain unknown.

The Gorgon is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant, even before his resurrection, trained in multiple forms of martial arts. He is an expert swordsman and typically prefers to use a [[katana]] during combat. Also, he typically uses his psionic abilities to read the minds of his opponents during combat situations (even highly trained minds like Wolverine's and Elektra's), enabling him to predict and counter their every move. He has used swords and a personal teleportation device. He currently wields Godkiller, a sword that has killed many kings, emperors, and also made a god bleed.
