==Fictional character biography==
Tomi Shishido is a member of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] and [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] and a powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], leading the extremist mutant society Dawn of the White Light. As a child, he possessed near superhuman levels of intelligence. Shishido said his first words at two weeks of age, could walk at three months, and was able to read and write by his first birthday. He became an accomplished painter by age four, among the top artists in all of [[Japan]] and composed an [[opera]] at age six. This is also the age when Shishido attempted a second [[suicide]].

At age 13, Shishido formulated a mathematical formula that proves the existence of [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|One-Above-All]] and manifested the mutant ability to turn people to stone just by looking at them. The media dubbed him as "The Gorgon", after the [[Gorgon]] of [[Greek mythology]]. Shortly after, he was the leader of a mutant death-cult called the Dawn of the White Light, which committed terrorist attacks throughout Japan. By age 18, he sought out the Hand. Before leaving his home, he killed his entire family and his only friend to prove that he was ruthless enough to join the terrorist organization.

After finding the Hand sanctuary and slaying all of its guards while blindfolded, the Gorgon went inside and pledged his allegiance to the Hand's Jonin. When the master questioned his dedication, the Gorgon impaled himself with his own sword, fatally injuring himself, and told the master to resurrect him. The Jonin were impressed and brought him into the fold.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, the Gorgon became connected to Hydra and formed a relationship with Elsbeth Von Strucker (the wife of Hydra leader [[Baron Strucker]]).<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #23.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Eventually, the Gorgon attempted to assassinate [[Nick Fury]] after S.H.I.E.L.D. launched an attack which destroyed a safe-house and killed Elsbeth in the process. He was intercepted by Wolverine before he could complete the objective. The two engaged in a brutal battle, inflicting devastating injuries upon one another. The Gorgon managed to gain the upper hand and attempted to use his mutant ability to transform Wolverine into stone; Wolverine's claws were extruded at the last moment, forcing the Gorgon to see his own reflection. As a result, the Gorgon's power was reflected back upon him. Once the Gorgon had been turned into stone, Wolverine shattered his body.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the events of ''[[Avengers World]]'', Gorgon and the Hand orchestrate a full-scale riot on [[Madripoor]] as a distraction from a ritual held at their temple on the island. Although [[Shang-Chi]] is able to infiltrate the Hand-based pagoda, it's too late to stop the séance, which raises the island nation out of the water up upon the head of a massive continent-sized [[dragon]].<ref>''Avengers World'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While the massive tarragon is airborne, Shang-Chi effortlessly defeats the Hand ninjas at the temple but is bested in hand-to-hand combat by the Gorgon who throws Shang-Chi off of his great beast several hundred feet below.<ref>''Avengers World'' #3.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite S.P.E.A.R and the Ascendants best efforts, the Master Ninja is able to reach Shanghai and observes from his temple while the dragon and the Hand's forces fight the Ascendants and Avengers in the city.<ref>''Avengers World'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Shang-Chi (who survived his encounter with the Gorgon and was rescued by S.P.E.A.R) uses [[Pym Particles]] supplied by Zheng to grow to the size of a giant and defeats the dragon in combat. As payback for his earlier defeat and the destruction caused by the Gorgon, Shang-Chi tears off the Hand's temple (with Gorgon screaming still trapped inside) from the dragon's head and throws it several miles away.<ref>''Avengers World'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Gorgon is part of the Hydra High Council that the new [[Madame Hydra]] is collecting to assist Steve Rogers who had history altered to be a Hydra sleeper agent for years.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Before being knocked down by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], Gorgon managed to briefly turn him to stone.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Shishido was later behind the Hand's Regenix operations. He is served by Scarlet Samurai who is actually [[Mariko Yashida]] resurrected. The two led an attack on [[Old Man Logan]] who was investigating the Hand's operations. When the [[Shingen Yashida|Silver Samurai]] assisted Old Man Logan, Silver Samurai fought Gorgon while Logan confronted Mariko. After Gorgon got away, Silver Samurai used some nanites to break the Hand's control on Mariko.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #31-33. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Geddon]]" storyline, [[Arnim Zola]] creates a bio-duplicate of Gorgon who accompanies some Hydra agents to Los Angeles in order to repossess [[Doctor Octopus#Superior Octopus|Superior Octopus]]' services. The Gorgon bio-duplicate fought Superior Octopus and his blindfold-removal had him turn Superior Octopus to stone. After shattering it on Zola's orders, Superior Octopus emerged and beheaded the Gorgon bio-duplicate.<ref>''Superior Octopus'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Gorgon is later one of the villainous mutants invited by the Quiet Council of Krakoa to live in their new mutant island nation, provided he no longer holds any grudges against his fellow mutants. The Hand grandmaster accepts and later even drinks a beer with Wolverine during a party.<ref>''House of X'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Gorgon possesses a variety of superhuman abilities as a result of genetic mutation and mystical enhancement from the Hand.

The Gorgon's primary mutant ability is the ability to transform an individual into stone by making eye contact with them. Gorgon's eyes have no visible features, glowing with a bright green energy. The Gorgon often wears a mask or pair of dark [[sunglasses]] in order to see without affecting those around him. Whether said face wear possess any sort of special properties or are composed of some special material designed to block his power was never revealed.

He was also born with, or soon achieved, an extraordinary level of intelligence, possibly at a superhuman level, and psionic abilities. He possesses advanced knowledge in multiple academic and artistic fields. This intellect makes him extremely arrogant. For some reason he equates intelligence with being a mutant. For example, Gorgon dismisses Reed Richards as simply the equivalent of a [[parrot]] that can mimic a human voice, despite the fact that Gorgon was actually impressed by Richards' ideas, simply because Richards is not a mutant.

After his resurrection, the Gorgon's strength, speed, reflexes/reactions, agility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance are all heightened to superhuman levels, the exact limits of which are unrevealed. Tomi also possesses an accelerated healing factor that enables him to repair damaged or destroyed tissue with extraordinary speed and efficiency. He is capable of healing from massive trauma inflicted by Wolverine's [[adamantium]] claws, bludgeoning, and falling from great heights while continuing to fight.

Aside from his physical advantages, the Mr. Shishido possesses some level of telepathy/empathy allowing him to hear the thoughts and feel the emotions of others. Much like his physical capabilities, the exact limits of the Gorgon's psionic powers remain unknown.

The Gorgon is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant, even before his resurrection, trained in multiple forms of martial arts. He is an expert swordsman and typically prefers to use a [[katana]] during combat. Also, he typically uses his psionic abilities to read the minds of his opponents during combat situations (even highly trained minds like Wolverine's and Elektra's), enabling him to predict and counter their every move. He has used swords and a personal teleportation device. He currently wields Godkiller, a sword that has killed many kings, emperors, and had also made a god bleed.

On top of various mutant powers and his acquired skill set. The Gorgon also has high-end ties to various criminal sects and their resources; many such innovations in his possession come from underworld affiliates such as A.I.M, The Hand and Hydra. He's also adept at ninjutsu and skilled in the dark arts; able to resurrect the formerly dead who serve his bedding as well as enact rituals which enable him to raise ancient creatures from eternal slumber.
