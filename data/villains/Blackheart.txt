== Fictional character biography ==
Centuries of murder in a locale named Christ's Crown, New York, draws the attention of a Hell-lord, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who creates a "son", Blackheart, from the energy of the accumulated evil.  Blackheart explores the nature of evil under his father's tutelage, clashing with and failing to corrupt [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #270</ref> Mephisto draws Daredevil, Brandy Ash, the genetically engineered Number Nine and the [[Inhumans]] [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]] and [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]] into Hell, where Blackheart tries to tempt them. However, he is impressed by humanity's free will and concludes that evil cannot hope to win out against good. When Mephisto learns of Blackheart's change of mind, he banishes him to Earth, warning him that if he ever uses his power again, he will be driven mad.<ref>''Daredevil'' #278–282.</ref>

Later, in an attempt to be free of captivity, Blackheart makes contact with Misha from the group [[Warheads (comics)|Warheads]] and becomes the source of her pre-cognitive visions.{{issue|date=December 2017}} Eventually Misha's squad, Kether Troop, invades Hell itself and frees Blackheart, who was temporarily in disguise.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

Blackheart returns to Christ's Crown and lures [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], [[Punisher]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to the town, hoping to recruit them in his war against Mephisto. When they all refuse, Blackheart brainwashes the entire town and kidnaps a young girl (child version of [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Lucy_Crumm_(Earth-616) Lucy Crumm]) all three men had befriended. The group follows Blackheart and the girl back into his own realm and defeats him.<ref>''Hearts of Darkness'' [graphic novel]</ref> As Mephisto forewarned, the usage of his powers in this attempt drives him to madness. He again attempts to commission the services of the three heroes, however he is shut down by the Ghost Rider who deems him no better than his father. Unexpectedly, the young girl runs to the defeated Blackheart and offers him forgiveness. Not knowing how to respond, Blackheart lays on the ground as he weeps. It is later revealed that Blackheart did not actually need her, just her blood, when Mephisto appears to him offering his aid in defeating them. Brandishing a dagger tipped in a small portion of her blood, Blackheart claims he has fulfilled a prophecy as he plunges the dagger into Mephisto; supposedly destroying him. Blackheart is then shown having taken over his portion of Hell.<ref>''The Dark Design'' graphic novel</ref>

Alongside the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], Blackheart brings [[Wonder Man]] to Mephisto's realm to battle Mephisto.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #22</ref>

Blackheart creates a group of [[Spirits of Vengeance]] in order to oppose the Ghost Rider, [[Noble Kale]]. Blackheart tricks Kale and tries to make him as a member of his group of Spirits of Vengeance, promising Kale the power to rule in Hell alongside him.  The Ghost Rider double-crosses Blackheart and kills him, freeing the other Spirits of Vengeance, and gaining rule over Blackheart's portion of Hell.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Having somehow survived, Blackheart attends a meeting with Mephisto, [[Satannish]], [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] and [[Dormammu]] about a disturbance created by the newly resurrected [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], who is looking for the Soulsword and the original Bloodstone amulet.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Blackheart attends the Devil's Advocacy to talk about the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]'s threat on Earth.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #627</ref>

Blackheart later concocts a scheme to bring Hell to Earth and steal the souls of the planet's residents. As part of the plan, he takes human form and runs an operation in Las Vegas that sees him create several clones of [[X-23]] and bond them to genetically created [[symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]]. After Ghost Rider accidentally transports Hell to Las Vegas, Blackheart is confronted by the Ghost Rider, [[Flash Thompson|Venom]], [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], and [[X-23]], and summons four creatures that represent the antitheses of the four and sets them against the heroes.<ref>''Venom (2011)'' #12</ref>

[[Theistic Satanism|Devil worshippers]], looking to give Satan the perfect son, began the Blackheart Project. They mated some of the vilest individuals in different combinations, hoping to find the right mix to breed the Antichrist. They finally succeeded, but in doing so, they caught the eye of [[Zadkiel (comics)|Zadkiel]]&nbsp;– a betrayer of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: G#God|God]] and usurper of Heaven. Zadkiel wanted to slay the Antichrist so the apocalypse would never come to pass and he would remain forever. The Black Host made quick work of his enemies and just about every man, woman and child were massacred except for his intended target.
Kid Blackheart settled in New York, but he could not stay hidden forever. Subjected to another assassination attempt, he would have perished if not for [[Jaine Cutter]] and her Breathing Gun. Jaine and the Antichrist fled but were again trapped by a group of mindless minions. [[Daimon Hellstrom|Hellstorm]], also tracking the boy so that he might kill him, ended up having no choice but to defend him from his attackers. Kid Blackheart ran, but did not get far before encountering Daniel Ketch. Snatching the boy from the streets and delivering him back to his saviors, Ketch was not surprised to see his brother, Johnny Blaze, and his [[Caretaker (comics)#Sister Sara|Caretaker]] already in their company. Ketch explained how he made a deal with the devil to keep the boy safe in exchange for the keys to Heaven to stop Zadkiel.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's On Fire'' #1</ref>

The group split up and the Antichrist played along, staying close to Sara, the Caretaker. When Jaine Cutter and Hellstorm were assaulted by [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]] and [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]], he and Sara became separated from them. Taking refuge in a defiled church, Kid Blackheart decided to reveal his true goal. [[Master Pandemonium]] ambushed Sara, knocking her unconscious, so she could be chained and bound.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's On Fire'' #5</ref> The Antichrist then said a few words in an unintelligible language and exposed Sara for what she truly was&nbsp;– a gateway to Heaven. Kid Blackheart, seeking to destroy Heaven for his father, led a horde of demons through her and into the shining city. However, once he arrived in Heaven, there was an army of Ghost Riders waiting on the other side. His troops did not stand a chance and he was forced to flee, but not before suffering a few blows from Knuckles O'Shaugnessy. Kid Blackheart met with Master Pandemonium and [[Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]] for some rest and relaxation before they made another go at conquering the world for Satan.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's On Fire'' #6</ref>

== Other versions ==
Blackheart is seen in ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' as one of those who are immune to the virus.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #2</ref>

=== Film ===
In the 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'', Blackheart is portrayed by [[Wes Bentley]], alongside his father [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephistopheles]]. Unlike his comic book counterpart, in which he is a large black-skinned demon with quills on his head, a tail and red eyes, in the film Blackheart assumes a human form, with pale white skin and black hair, though at many points in the film, he briefly shows his demonic facial features. Despite having many presumed supernatural powers, he mainly uses his hands to kill people with a "lethal touch". He also has the ability to sense people by "smelling" their fear. Though he has all of his father's powers, Blackheart is unaffected by anything holy, as he enters both a church and later a sacred funeral ground, due to his having been born in Hell and hence never having fallen from Heaven. He is immune to the Ghost Rider's Penance Stare, as he has no soul to burn.  Blackheart seeks to obtain the Contract of San Venganza, which allows its possessor access to the power of a thousand evil souls. However, when Mephisto finds out about his son's search for the Contract, he forces Johnny Blaze to serve his purpose as his Ghost Rider to track down and kill Blackheart and his minions. Once gaining the Contract, Blackheart calls for all one thousand cursed souls to enter his body, taking on the name of [[Legion (demon)|Legion]], and gains the ability to regenerate after his body is disintegrated. However, now that he has absorbed a thousand souls, the villain is now vulnerable to Ghost Rider's Penance Stare, with which Ghost Rider kills him. Mephisto then takes possession of Blackheart's lifeless body and departs from Earth.
