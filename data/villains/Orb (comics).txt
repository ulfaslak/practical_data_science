'''Drake Shannon''' was born in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. An accomplished [[motorcycle]] [[stunt|stunt rider]], he owned one-half of the traveling motorcycle stunt show which would later feature Johnny Blaze (who would later become Ghost Rider). The other half of the show was owned by Blaze's mentor, Crash Simpson.

While the partnership was initially amiable, the two men grew apart and eventually an intense rivalry developed. Neither wanted to work with the other, but neither wanted to sell their half of the show.  To settle the dispute, the two men agreed to a lengthy [[racing|race]], with the winner receiving full ownership of the traveling show.

After many miles of neck-and-neck competition, Shannon deliberately swerved towards Simpson in an effort to force Simpson to [[car accident|crash]]. However, the maneuver caused Shannon to lose control of his motorcycle. While Simpson managed to remain upright and continue on with the race, Shannon slid 25 yards on his unprotected [[face]]. The accident left him hideously [[disfigurement|disfigured]].

After his recovery, for reasons never adequately explained, Shannon was given a powerful [[motorcycle helmet]] by [[They Who Wield Power]]. The helmet, which was modeled to look like a giant eyeball, could hypnotize people.  A later version could also shoot powerful laser beams from its "[[pupil]]".

Calling himself "The Orb", Shannon attempted to take over the traveling motorcycle stunt show which he had once half-owned. He put the lives of dozens of innocent people at risk, but informed Johnny Blaze (now the sole owner of the stunt show) that he would let them go unharmed in exchange for the sole ownership of the stunt show. Although Blaze capitulated, Shannon instructed his [[henchman|minions]] to kill the [[hostage]]s anyway, so that no one would know how the ownership changed hands. At this point, [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Spider-Man]] teamed up to defeat him.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #15 (November 1973). [[Marvel Comics]]</ref>

Becoming a professional criminal, he returned several times, always plotting to get revenge on the Ghost Rider. The Orb attacked Delazny Studios, and battled the Ghost Rider again.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #14-15 (October and December. 1975).

A successor to the original Orb. He was born with a head that resembled a giant eye and was abandoned at a young age and grew up in a [[freak show]].<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire'' #5 (November 2010). Marvel Comics</ref><ref>https://pulllist.comixology.com/previews/OCT090523/5/</ref><ref>http://www.aintitcool.com/node/43312</ref>

After performing a number of unidentified jobs, this Orb was hired to take down [[Caretaker (comics)|Caretaker]] alongside [[Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]] II, [[Death-Ninja]] and [[Doghead (Marvel Comics)|Doghead]]. Blackout alleged that the Orb was killed by the Caretaker,<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #26 (Oct. 2008). Marvel Comics</ref> but it was later revealed that he was merely hospitalized with massive eye trauma.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire'' #2 (November 2009). Marvel Comics</ref>

He is later one of the villains considered by Blackout and the [[Deacon (comics)|Deacon]] to help them assassinate the Ghost Rider.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #33 (May 2009). Marvel Comics</ref> He was later broken out of prison and began to work for [[Zadkiel (comics)|Zadkiel]].<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's On Fire'' #1-2 (October - November 2009). Marvel Comics</ref> During the climactic confrontation with the Ghost Riders, the Orb had the fingers of his left hand shot off and was again returned to the prison hospital as a cellmate of the paralyzed Deacon.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire'' #5-6 (February - March 2010). Marvel Comics</ref>

This second Orb was notable for the fact that he almost never stopped talking (much to the frustration of both his teammates and his enemies) and that while he always boasted of his prowess with his repulsor ray, he never actually successfully hit anyone with it.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

Orb resurfaced in the ''[[Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine]]'' miniseries, robbing a bank. He was sent skipping through time by some glowing diamonds. Eventually, he gained some understanding of time travel but was apprehended by the Minutemen before he could put this knowledge to use.<ref>''Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine'' #1-6 (July 2010-July 2011). Marvel Comics</ref>

Orb later appeared with a group of minions in eye-based masks, having just stolen the eyes of a group of people at a bank. Clearly insane, he claimed that he rolled around naked in eyeballs, regarding the eyes as 'windows to the soul' that he could gather power from before his rematch with the Ghost Rider. He claimed that he could see the true selves of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Betty Ross|Red She-Hulk]] when he looked into their eyes, describing Betty's conflicting relationship with her father and recognizing that a 'monster' was behind Hulk's eyes that was not the Hulk himself.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #7.1 (July 2012). Marvel Comics</ref>

In the wake of [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]'s murder in the 2014 miniseries "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]", Orb and Exterminatrix are discovered to be in possession of one of Uatu's gouged-out eyes,<ref name="OriginalSin#1">[[Aaron, Jason]] (w), [[Deodato, Mike]] (a). ''Original Sin'' #1 (July 2014). Marvel Comics</ref>  but after he is captured, he maintains that he did not commit the murder.<ref name="OriginalSin#3">Aaron, Jason (w), Deodato, Mike (a). ''Original Sin'' #3 (August 2014). Marvel Comics</ref> Doctor Strange and Punisher then take Orb to a satellite,<ref>Aaron, Jason (w), Deodato, Mike (a). ''Original Sin'' #4 (August 2014).

''Original Sin'' #8 (October 2014). Marvel Comics</ref>

Orb reappears trying to steal a future-predicting Rigellian Recorder from [[Deadpool]] and the [[Mercs for Money]], claiming that the burden of the Watcher's power has made him want to prevent anyone else from having access to similar capabilities, "because I've seen what that can do to someone!" In the midst of a high-speed highway battle, he and his motorcycle are knocked into the [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]] by Merc member [[Foolkiller#Gregory P. Salinger|Foolkiller]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Salva Espin|inker = Salva Espin|colorist = Guru-eFX|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

He returns having kidnapped [[Doctor Strange]] in the "Blood in the Aether" storyline, where he is revealed to have regained the Watcher's power, now influencing those he observes to commit more brutal actions, such as telling a loner in an apartment that he is viewed as a creep by others in the building and should kill them in response.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Jason Aaronn|penciller = Chris Bachalo, Jorge Fornés|colorist = John Livesay, Tim Townsend, Al Vey, Victor Olazaba, Jorge Fornés |letterer = VC's Corey Petit|editor = Nick Lowe|title = Doctor Strange|volume = 1|issue = #15|date = 18 December 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Drake Shannon is an athletic man with no superhuman powers. He is an expert stunt motorcyclist and a capable hand-to-hand combatant. However, the Orb is criminally insane as a result of the accident which disfigured his face. As the Orb, he wears a helmet originally provided by "They Who Wield Power" composed of unspecified materials, containing specialized micro-circuitry, capable of firing laser blasts and hypnotizing victims. The Orb rides a motorcycle which he specially modified.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

The second Orb used a repulsor ray gun. Unlike the original Orb, this Orb's head is an actual giant eyeball.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #27 (November 2008), letters page. Marvel Comics</ref> He claims to be able to talk by flexing certain muscles in his 'eye'/head.<ref name="OriginalSin#3" /> He has merged with one of the eyes of [[Uatu]], which now resides in his chest.<ref name="OriginalSin#8" />
