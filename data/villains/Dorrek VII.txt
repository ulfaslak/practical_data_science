==Fictional character biography==
{{Section too long|date=July 2018}}

Dorrek VII is an emperor of the [[Skrull]] empire. He came to power by murdering the previous emperor, after which he married the latter's daughter R'Kill and had a daughter named [[Anelle]].<ref name="Fantastic Four #206">''Fantastic Four'' #206</ref>

A Skrull named Krimmon had plans to displace Dorrek VII. This plan failed and he was brought before Dorrek VII where he had Krimmon forced into a small crystalline form.<ref>''Iron Man'' #65</ref>

Dorrek VII orders his Skrull captain Zankor to investigate [[Earth]] in order to determine if it was worthy for invasion by the Skrulls. Zankor sends agents to gather intelligence, but only one manages to return. Dorrek VII wanted to learn about Earth's secrets and gives orders to Zankor to use the Encephalo-Link which contained the memories of the previously-captive humans so that they can infiltrate Earth's society.<ref>''Marvel: The Lost Generation'' #11</ref>

Dorrek learns that the planned Skrull invasion of Earth was thwarted by the [[Fantastic Four]]. Wanting revenge, Dorrek creates the [[Super-Skrull]], who possesses the Fantasic Four's abilities.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #18</ref> He then sends him to Earth to replace Dr. [[Franklin Storm]]. The Super-Skrull is defeated and returned to the Skrull homeworld.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #32</ref>

Upon seeing that the [[Kree]] had sent an agent to Earth who defeated the [[Sentry (Kree)|Kree Sentry]], Dorrek VII assumed that they had goals that the Skrulls should thwart and sent the Super-Skrull to Earth, where he was defeated by the Kree agent [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #2</ref>

When Super-Skrull returns from his exile to the Skrull homeworld with three captives (Captain Marvel, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and [[Scarlet Witch]]), Dorrek captures Super-Skrull and imprisons the others, threatening to kill the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver to force Captain Marvel to share the secrets of the Omni-Wave, a Kree device with destructive capabilities.<ref>''Avengers'' #94</ref> Dorrek VII monitored the battle between the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the Skrulls on Earth. As Commander Kalxor threatened the Avengers, Dorrek VII bragged that Captain Marvel should be done with the Omni-Wave. What Dorrek VII didn't know was that Captain Marvel escaped and freed Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. This angered Dorrek VII who ordered Commander Kalxor to initiate Plan Delta which was the destruction of Earth.<ref>''Avengers'' #96</ref> As the war progressed, Captain Marvel finished the Omni-Wave causing Dorrek VII to rejoice despite Anelle begging him to stop. The Avengers and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] manage to halt the war, and Captain Marvel escapes.<ref>''Avengers'' #97</ref>

The superhuman [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] attack the Skrull homeworld and are captured. They are then put into confinement where they are tortured and have DNA samples taken, but later escape.<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #1</ref> Dorrek's scientists then worked to reverse-engineer the genetic mutations from the DNA samples.<ref>''New Avengers'' #40</ref><ref>''New Avengers'' #44</ref>

Anelle gave birth to a son that she named [[Hulkling|Dorrek VIII]]. Dorrek VII ordered that the baby be put to death upon learning that the baby's father was Mar-Vell. Dorrek VIII's nurse snuck him away and took him to Mar-Vell.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #10</ref>

While commanding a Skrull fleet during an attack on the planet Xandar, Dorrek VII grew frustrated when the Fantastic Four helped to save Xandar. While conveying his frustration to Drexxon, Dorrek VII gave orders to Kylon to destroy the Earthlings when he learned that more vessels were approaching.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #205</ref>

Dorrek VII was thrilled when three of the Fantastic Four were captured and had Thing tortured for being insolent. Then Dorrek VII had Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, and Thing stand trial before Hagar in the Skrull court where Jaketch used a metabolic booster to age the three of them knowing that they would be dead in three days. Upon being informed that Kylon's vessels were stopped, Dorrek VII grew frustrated and was taunted by R'Kill upon her return from the Grexell base that she had her vacation at. When the Fantastic Four escaped, Dorrek VII let them go knowing that they would die while becoming unaware that the Fantastic Four would later reverse the effects of the metabolic booster. She then began to question Dorrek VII's judgement. Both of them secretly vowed to see the other one dead.<ref name="Fantastic Four #206"/>

Dorrek's wife R'Kill eventually kills Dorekk VII with a shot to the back and takes over the Skrull Empire.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #209</ref>
