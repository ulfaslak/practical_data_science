'''Mephisto''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|The Silver Surfer]]'' #3 (Dec. 1968) and was introduced in the Marvel universe by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Buscema]], based on [[Mephistopheles]] – a demon character from the [[Faust]] legend, who often went by Mephisto as a nickname.

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], the character has appeared in over four decades of Marvel continuity. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including animated television series, feature film, toys, [[trading cards]], and video games.

==Publication history==
Inspired by the Mephisto of the Faust legend,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} he was introduced into Marvel comics by writer [[Stan Lee]] and penciler [[John Buscema]], Mephisto debuted in ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|The Silver Surfer]]'' #3 ([[cover-date]]d Dec. 1968), and was established as a perennial foe for the cosmic hero, also appearing in ''Silver Surfer'' #8–9 (Sept.–Oct. 1969) and #16–17 (May – June 1970). Author [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] has described Mephisto as "the [[tempter]] who could offer the endlessly soul-tormented Silver Surfer the world, even dangling the Surfer's off-limits long-distance lover in front of him. As always the case with Lee's heroes, the Surfer's goodness and nobility won out, but Mephisto was only stymied, not defeated, and the pattern was set.<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

Mephisto went on to become a foe for the [[Norse god]] [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in ''Thor'' #180–181 (Sept.- Oct. 1970), ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #8 (Oct. 1971) and ''Thor''  #204–205 (Oct.–Nov. 1972). He was later revealed to be the being to whom [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] had sold his soul and had been cursed to become the Ghost Rider,<ref>''Ghost Rider'' # 68, May 1981</ref> in a [[retroactive continuity]] that placed him in the role originally played by Satan. This was later retconned back to Satan,{{Issue|date=July 2010}} though Mephisto's influence is still felt in the 1990s by the [[Danny Ketch]] Ghost Rider.

Other appearances included posing as [[Satan]] in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #5 (Aug. 1972); tormenting the titular superhero team in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #155–157 (Feb.–April 1975) and ''Thor'' #310 (Aug. 1981) and #325 (Nov. 1982). Mephisto also guest starred in two [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]: ''[[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]]'' vol. 2, #1–12 (Oct. 1985 – Sept. 1986) and ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #1 9 (July 1985 – March 1986), before starring in the self-titled [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Mephisto vs.'' #1–4 (April–July 1987), battling several of Marvel's super teams. The series was penciled by co-creator Buscema.

In ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #266 (May 1989), penciler [[John Romita, Jr.]] redesigned the character, re-imagining him as a bloated, nude creature with short, vaguely frog-like legs and a demonic head. Romita explained, "I couldn’t see the Devil with tights and a cape."<ref name="Back21">{{cite journal|last= Cordier|first= Philippe|date= April 2007|title= Seeing Red: Dissecting Daredevil's Defining Years|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 21|pages= 33–60 '''which page quote on?'''|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Subsequent portrayals have varied between Mephisto's original appearance and the Romita redesign.

Mephisto continued to torment the Scarlet Witch in ''[[Avengers West Coast]]'' #51–52 (Nov.–Dec. 1989); created a new adversary for the Marvel heroes in ''Daredevil'' #270 (Sept. 1989); and appeared in the [[graphic novel]] ''Triumph and Torment: Dr. Strange and Dr. Doom'' (1989).  Additionally, he was featured prominently in the ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]'' storyline in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #544; ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #24; [[The Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)|''Sensational Spider-Man'' (vol. 2)]] #41 and ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (Oct. 2007 – Jan. 2008).

In 2009, Mephisto was ranked #48 on [[IGN]]'s list of Greatest Comic Book Villains of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/48.html Mephisto is number 48 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515014329/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/48.html |date=May 15, 2009 }}, [[IGN]].</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Mephisto is a perennial villain in the Marvel Universe, and is responsible for a number of evil acts, including capturing and holding the soul of [[Cynthia Von Doom]] – the mother of [[Doctor Doom]] — until [[Doctor Strange]] and Doom free her to ascend to [[heaven]].<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #8 (Oct. 1971) and ''Triumph and Torment: Dr. Strange and Dr. Doom'' (1989)</ref> He was jealous of the worship of the fire demon [[Zarathos]], so, posing as [[Satan]], Mephisto creates the [[Ghost Rider]] by bonding Zarathos to [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]].<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #5 (Aug. 1972)</ref> In one story where he battled Thor, he was shown to have various historical villains in his realm, such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Blackbeard]], and [[Attila the Hun]].<ref>''Thor'' #205 (Nov. 1972)</ref>

Mephisto claims to have been created, along with many other demons, by the supreme being whose suicide resulted in the creation of the Marvel Universe as well as the Infinity Gems. He also claimed that his total evil nature is because the supreme being did not choose to make him good, as that being had no concept of it.<ref>"Silver Surfer" #45 (Jan. 1991)</ref>

Mephisto acted as servant of the mad Titan [[Thanos]] during the War of the Gems, seeking to attain that power for himself. He is also responsible for capturing the souls of heroes [[Mister Fantastic]] (whose intelligence was also stolen by Mephisto), the [[Invisible Woman]], and [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] due to a botched summoning by an [[exorcist]].<ref name="Fantastic Four #277 Apr. 1985">''Fantastic Four'' #277 (Apr. 1985)</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' storyline, Mephisto seeks to steal [[Beyonder]]'s powers or to destroy him to win the favor of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. Mephisto sends an army of supervillains called the [[Legion Accursed]] to attack the Beyonder, who is saved by the Thing. After the Legion Accursed was defeated, Mephisto returned its members to where they were before he formed the Legion Accursed.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #7</ref>

Mephisto later creates his 'son' [[Blackheart]], a demonic entity that plagues many of Earth's heroes.<ref>''Daredevil'' #270 (Sep. 1989)</ref>

Mephisto later manipulates the sorcerer [[Master Pandemonium]] into gathering the five scattered fragments of his soul that were lost in an ill-fated encounter with the aforementioned Franklin.<ref name="Fantastic Four #277 Apr. 1985"/><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story=  I Sing of Arms and Heroes...| title= Avengers West Coast| volume= | issue= 51| date= Mid-November 1989}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story=  Fragments of a Greater Darkness| title= Avengers West Coast| volume= | issue= 52| date= December 1989}}</ref> When the [[Scarlet Witch]] attempts to use magic to conceive children with her husband, the android [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], she unknowingly summons two of Pandemonium's soul fragments, which are born as her infant twins. The revelation of her children's origin, followed by their loss when reabsorbed into him, drives the Scarlet Witch insane.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #1 – 12 (1985–1986); ''Avengers West Coast'' #51 – 52 (Nov. – Dec. 1989)</ref>

Mephisto also tries to destroy the Avenger [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] when he enters Hell to try to save the soul of his deceased wife, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Annual (2000)</ref>

Mephisto also heals [[Aunt May|May Parker]] in exchange for changing the personal timelines of Peter Parker ([[Spider-Man]]) and [[Mary Jane Watson]] so that they never married, claiming he did so only because he hated their happiness (also adding that he has no interest in taking Spider-Man's soul because such a deal results in him tormenting a soul that is willing to accept the punishment because their sacrifice saved another, a righteousness which disgusts him). He also, at Mary Jane's request, erases knowledge of Peter's identity. During the process, [[Harry Osborn]] is also somehow brought back to life.<ref>''One More Day'' — ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #544; ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #24; ''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #41 and ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (Oct. 2007 – Jan. 2008)</ref>

During the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, Mephisto had bartered part of his realm to the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] death goddess [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] for 1,001 years in exchange for control for 101 days of the 13 surviving Dísir, dangerous evil predecessors to the Valkyries that were created by Odin's father Bor.{{issue|date=April 2012}} This troubles the minions who had previously lived in this territory, and part of ''Siege Aftermath'' shows the "last stand of the perfidious diaspora" in what seems to have been a revolt. The revolt is quickly put down by the Dísir under Mephisto's command. The Dísir leader Brün tries to negotiate with Mephisto because she wishes to invade Hela's Hel and feast on the souls of Asgardian dead. Mephisto tells her that he has no interest in Hel but he does not object to their invasion.<ref>''Thor'' #611</ref> Thor, trying to defend Hel and its dead, enters Mephisto's domain to find the Eir-gram, a magical sword that can cut the otherwise insubstantial Dísir. Mephisto offers to give him the Eir-Gram and a "happily ever after" for Asgard if he agrees not to interfere with one of Mephisto's plans, which is not at that time named. Thor remains silent the whole time. Mephisto grants him entry to Hell, but Thor must survive many difficulties before he finds the blade.<ref>''Thor'' #612</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Mephisto appears before a de-powered Johnny Blaze during the attack by [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] in the form of Skadi and states that he has damned the human race. Mephisto then states that he will help Johnny save the human race from the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]] and the Worthy.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 7 #1</ref> Mephisto goes on a date with New Mutants member Magma; apparently confiding in her, he explains that, while he is the embodiment of one of the great forces of the universe, the force that created him also gave him desires and emotions, and occasionally wants to do human things.<ref>''New Mutants'' #37</ref> Magma later confided to Blink that she has subsequently seen Mephisto again, but wishes to keep it secret.<ref>''New Mutants'' #41</ref> After speaking with the Gods at the Infinite Embassy, Mephisto headed to the Devil's Advocacy to speak with the other demons about the Serpent's threat on Earth.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #627</ref>

Mephisto briefly appears to assist [[Deadpool]] in destroying one of his demon lieutenants,<ref>''Deadpool'' v. 3 #11-12</ref> before taking a major part in the Hell On Earth War,<ref>''X-Factor'' v. 1 #250-256</ref> where he is defeated and replaced by [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] member [[Strong Guy]] as ruler of Hell.<ref>''X-Factor'' v. 1 #256</ref>

When the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] were accidentally transported to Hell, Mephisto took the opportunity to give them a way out if they defeated Strong Guy.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #21</ref> [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] convinced Strong Guy to abandon the position of Hell-lord and try to regain his lost soul allowing Mephisto to regain the throne and let the Thunderbolts return to Earth.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol 2 #22</ref>

Mephisto is revealed to have assumed the form of [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] to try to prevent Victor von Doom from redeeming his soul.<ref>''Infamous Iron Man'' #5-11</ref>

During the "[[Damnation (comics)|Damnation]]" storyline, Mephisto finds out that Doctor Strange has restored the lives of the Las Vegas citizens that were killed during the [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] bombing back during the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline. He orchestrates events that causes his demons to bring Doctor Strange to his recently-created Hotel Inferno. Mephisto claims that the remnants of Las Vegas were in his realm before it was restored. Hotel Inferno starts to have an effect on the people of Las Vegas. In addition, it also had an effect on Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Falcon, Hawkeye, and Jane Foster's Thor form where they were all turned into Ghost Rider-like creatures.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Damnation'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Hotel Inferno starts to affect the people of Las Vegas, Doctor Strange fought Mephisto in a game of [[blackjack]]. The deal is that Mephisto had to return the souls to Las Vegas if Doctor Strange won and that Doctor Strange's soul would be claimed if Mephisto won. Though Doctor Strange won by cheating, Mephisto found out and had Doctor Strange tortured.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #386. Marvel Comics.</ref> Then Mephisto turns Doctor Strange into a Ghost Rider-like creature.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Damnation'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mephisto is an extremely powerful [[Immortality|immortal]] demonic entity possessing magical powers and abilities gained by manipulation of the forces of magic. Mephisto is capable of using his power for a variety of uses, including superhuman strength, shape and size shifting,<ref>''Thor'' #310 (Aug. 1981) and ''Daredevil'' #279 (Apr. 1990)</ref> projecting illusions,<ref>''Thor'' #310 (Aug. 1981)</ref> manipulating memories,<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #1 (Jul. 1987)</ref> and altering time.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (Jan. 2008)</ref> He is also highly resistant to injury.<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #5 (Nov. 1991)</ref>

The character has been shown to be energized by sources of evil in the human realm, such as the alien [[Dire Wraith]]s.<ref name="Fantastic Four #277 Apr. 1985"/> Like other demons, Mephisto is symbiotically linked to, and considerably more powerful within, his own realm, and the character is able to transform the structure at will.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #3 (Oct. 1968)</ref> Within it he has threatened a galaxy, and stalemated a nourished [[Galactus]] until the latter threatened to consume his realm.<ref>''The Silver Surfer: Judgment Day'' (1988): Written by [[Stan Lee]], the creator of both characters.</ref> If Mephisto's physical form is destroyed, the character will [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] and reform in his domain.<ref>''Mephisto vs. Fantastic Four'' #1 (April 1987)</ref>

Mephisto is known for acquiring souls, but cannot subjugate the will of another being without the victim's permission, which is usually done with some form of [[deal with the Devil|pact]].<ref>''Triumph and Torment: Dr. Strange and Dr. Doom'' (1989)</ref>

This incarnation of the character is the Devil, making a deal with Johnny Blaze to save his father from cancer in return for his future service, only for Johnny's father to die in an accident the day after making the deal. Some years later, Mephistopheles 'requests' that Johnny act as his agent to recover the Contract of San Venganza, an entire town who sold their souls to Mephistopheles, but the contract is acquired by Blackheart before the Ghost Rider subsequently renders him catatonic, Blaze deciding to hold on to the curse despite the offer to be released from his service so that Mephistopheles cannot recruit a less scrupulous person.
* Mephistopheles appears as the Devil in ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]''. The Devil appears in the form of a man named '''Roarke''' (played by [[Ciarán Hinds]]) and has fathered a child with a woman named Nadya (played by [[Violante Placido]]) after saving her life. Roarke has plans for the boy named Danny (played by Fergus Riorden) that involve him becoming his host, as Danny's conception means that using him as a host would give Roarke full access to his powers on Earth where he is normally limited to temporary visits in rapidly decaying bodies. In the end, he is sent back to Hell by Ghost Rider after Danny uses his natural powers to give Blaze a power boost.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
