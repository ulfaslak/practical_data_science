'''Mentallo''' ('''Marvin Flumm''') is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. After having been fired for cause after attempting a covert [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] takeover, he has since operated as both a freelance criminal and subversive and a high-ranking agent of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. He is usually depicted as using technology to increase his power.

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=March 2016}}
Mentallo first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #141 (February 1966) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Marvin Flumm was born in [[Watford City, North Dakota]].  He once worked as a shoe salesman. As a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] telepath of moderate ability, Mentallo was recruited by the original [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as a candidate for their ESP Division. However, he teamed with the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] in an attempt to take over S.H.I.E.L.D., clashing with [[Nick Fury]] for the first time.<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 1 #141</ref> He then served as a division leader in the [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] fragment led by [[Silvermane]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #123</ref> Mentallo teamed with the Fixer again, and they placed [[Deathlok]] (Luther Manning) under their control. They attempted to make the U.S. President their slave, but were thwarted by the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #26-27</ref> Mentallo and the Fixer were employed by HYDRA again, but Mentallo was rendered comatose by the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]].<ref>''Micronauts'' #24-25</ref> In [[Professor Power]]'s custody, Mentallo battled [[Professor X]] on a psychic plane.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #118</ref> Mentallo was captured by the [[Super-Adaptoid]] (impersonating the Fixer) but he was rescued by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #287</ref>

As '''Think Tank''', he was a member of the [[Resistants]], which was originally an incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. The Resistants opposed the [[Registration acts (comics)|Mutant Registration Act]]. Think-Tank fought [[U.S. Agent (comics)|Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #346</ref> He was imprisoned, and resumed his Mentallo identity. He started a mass breakout at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] by using [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] due to [[Truman Marsh]]'s treatment. However, his powers were briefly amplified and used by [[Iron Man]] to compel the escapees to surrender.<ref>''Avengers: Death Trap, the Vault''</ref> He then directed an unsuccessful attack on the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #18</ref> Mentallo later attended the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] weapons exposition.<ref>''Captain America'' #412</ref>

Mentallo once worked for the [[Red Skull]] and partnered with the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] in a successful attempt to brainwash the Hulk to attack the Avengers. Mentallo managed to mentally impersonate the Hulk's wife-killing [[Brian Banner|father]] and bully into submission.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #403</ref>

Shortly after the events of [[World War Hulk]], Mentallo was among the members of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Crime Syndicate.<ref>''New Avengers'' #35 (2007)</ref> He remained with them until they were defeated by the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #2 (2008)</ref>

Some time after, Mentallo was hired by [[MODOK]] to be part of a supervillain heist squad. Due to his psychic powers, he realized MODOK created a psychic illusion of money to secure everyone's loyalty, and MODOK secretly told him the "full extent" of the plans would be revealed to him, and several other villains.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> Mentallo quickly decided that instead he was going to sell the villain out to whoever stumped up the cash. After noticing the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] had a telepathic shield and [[Spider-Man]]'s powers and Spider-Sense, he went to offer to betray MODOK's plans to the Avengers for cash. Unfortunately for Mentallo, it wasn't Spider-Man at all but A.I.M.'s [[Super-Adaptoid|Ultra-Adaptoid]] which incinerated him to protect its cover.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' (vol. 2) #2</ref> He was presumed dead, but Mentallo was revealed to be alive when he appeared at Ryker's Island to inform the Fantastic Four and S.H.I.E.L.D. about the New Defenders.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}

In ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', a person who look likes Mentallo appears as part of the Hood's alliance with super-powered heroes. The group is intent on defeating the [[Skrull]] invasion force of New York City.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7</ref> He was later seen, during an attack on the New Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' #56-57</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, [[Norman Osborn]] has Mentallo torture [[Clint Barton]] for the New Avengers' location.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #3 (2010)</ref>

During the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline, Mentallo once again encountered the Avengers. He attempted to control [[Reptil]]'s mind, but Reptil transformed himself into a dinosaur. Mentallo is unable to control the reptillian mind. Reptil was unable to control himself as well, and Mentallo is badly savaged as a result.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #6</ref>

Mentallo psychically enslaved the [[Kaiju]] monsters of Monster Island on behalf of the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Corporation]] (who attempted to seize control of Monster Island to drill for oil). He was stopped and defeated by the [[X-Men]], after he double-crossed Roxxon and tried to flee with his professional fee of a billion dollars. While attempting to flee, one of the giant monsters dropped a cargo hold directly on top of him, which contained the entire billion dollars in cash.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #36-41</ref>

Mentallo later appears as part of the new High Council of A.I.M. (consisting of [[Andrew Forson]], [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], Jude the Entropic Man, [[Superia]], [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]], and the undercover [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]) as the Minister of Public Affairs.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Mentallo was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mentallo is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with limited psionic powers which can be augmented through scientific means often provided by the Fixer. Mentallo has telepathy and can read the thoughts of any human mind within an approximate five mile (8&nbsp;km) radius. He has the ability to project "mental bolts" at opponents, create psionic screens to protect himself from psionic assault, control the bodies and minds of other humans, communicate telepathically, and cast mental illusions. Mentallo has difficulty focusing his powers on moving targets. He is unusually vulnerable to psionic attack unless he erects a mental screen.

Mentallo wears a modified [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] battle-suit. He has used various weaponry, including conventional firearms, rocket-guns, and a "sonic whammer" which projects intense vibratory blasts. He usually wears a special helmet to protect him against telepathic feedback, background noise, and psionic assault from other telepaths. Fixer has supplied him with "electronic masks" (or "servo-pods") which adhere to victims' faces and place them under Mentallo's control. Fixer's "mentascope" enables Mentallo to use his psionic power to locate and attack victims from afar. Mentallo is capable of flight via Fixer's "anti-grav propellant unit" or "flying discs" and has also used a tank that can bore through the ground.

Mentallo also has the ability to send out mental probes to identify the shape and size of objects in his near vicinity, effectively acting as a radar-sense. He can even locate invisible and intangible objects this way.

As the Resistants member Think Tank, he rode within a small tread-propelled vehicle in which he sat, with his upper body and head still exposed. This tank unit was armed with a wide range of weapons — machine guns, metal grappler arms etc. — which Mentallo directly controlled with his telepathic ability and a special interface helmet.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Mentallo (alongside [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]] and [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]]) is a member of the Red Guard that was positioned in Australia to serve Exodus.<ref>''Hulk: Broken Worlds'' #1</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Marvin Flumm is an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #7</ref> After the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]]'s nuclear attack on [[Washington, D.C.]] killed almost the whole political cabinet, he took advantage of the civil war chaos as [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]]'s "replacement" as acting director of S.H.I.E.L.D. to order the [[Ultimates]]' capture,<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #11</ref> while trying to be an adviser to the new president.<ref>''Ultimate Comics Ultimates'' #13</ref> After [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]] and [[Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)|Thor]] defeat the Maker, Flumm (under orders from [[Móði and Magni|Mr. Morez (Modi)]]) tries to kill [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]]. However, Flumm's traitor status is ultimately revealed by [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Monica Chang]] and is subsequently fired from S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #16</ref>

The Ultimate version of Mentallo makes a minor appearance in [[Jefferson Davis (comics)|Jefferson Davis]]'s undercover story. Mentallo is captured by [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] and used as the first genetic source for a "mutate" (Marvel's term for genetically-modified humans as opposed to natural mutants) for [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] and the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]]. Nick Fury leads S.H.I.E.L.D. to stop this illegal transaction; Mentallo's fate is unknown.<ref>''Miles Morales: The Ultimate Spider-Man'' #9</ref>
