'''The Mutant Liberation Front,''' or '''MLF,''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] group appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The group has been depicted as primarily enemies of [[X-Force]]. Created by writer [[Louise Simonson]] and artist [[Rob Liefeld]], the Mutant Liberation Front first appeared in ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]'' #86 (February 1990).

The Mutant Liberation group consisted of young [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], formed under the mutant [[time travel|time-traveler]] [[Stryfe]]. After his apparent death, the group reforms under [[Reignfire]].

==History==
The Mutant Liberation Front first appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #86. In this brief initial appearance only five of the original eight members can be seen clearly; [[Strobe (comics)|Strobe]] and [[Stryfe]] appear in only one panel each, with their faces obscured, while all that can be seen of [[Forearm (comics)|Forearm]] is his two right arms in a single panel. The MLF was primarily the antagonist of the New Mutants and their successor group, [[X-Force]]. They are eventually defeated by a consortium of X-Force, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], and the [[X-Men]] during the "[[X-Cutioner's Song]]" [[story arc]]. A second incarnation is assembled later by a villain known as [[Reignfire]].

The team seemed mainly organized of disillusioned, anarchic [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] youths. Stryfe founded the group sometime after coming to the 20th century (from roughly 2,000 years in the future). They were likely assembled as a tool while Stryfe assembled his master plan which he executed in "X-Cutioner's Song". The exact size of the organization is unknown, but they were seen to have had several advanced bases around the world and employed a number of presumably human guards.

The team's first mission was to rescue [[Rusty Collins|Rusty]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], two New Mutants who had been captured by the government. Rusty and Skids would not be seen for some time, but when they were it was revealed that they stayed with the group due to mind control devices Stryfe implanted in them. It was never indicated that any of the other members had similar implants.

After the organization was dismantled in the "X-Cutioner's Song", four of the imprisoned members ([[Forearm (comics)|Forearm]] Reaper, [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]] and [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]] ) were liberated and recruited by a mysterious villain named Reignfire, who was believed to be a futuristic version of [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]. Already among the ranks of the new MLF were former New Mutant [[Dani Moonstar]] (undercover on behalf of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]) and Locus. X-Force's [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] also defected to the MLF, and Tempo betrayed them and went her own way.  After a few minor missions, including a group that infiltrated [[Muir Island]] to obtain information on the [[Legacy Virus]], the group was captured by members of [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]] and never reformed.
