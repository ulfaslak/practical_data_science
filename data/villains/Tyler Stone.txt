Tyler runs the [[Alchemax]] Corporation, one of the largest corporate powers in the dystopian 2099 future of Earth. When one of his promising young employees, [[Spider-Man 2099|Miguel O'Hara]], develops a troubling conscience over testing on humans, Stone has him secretly addicted to the highly potent drug 'Rapture', that he, of course, controls, to force his compliance.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=282}}</ref> Miguel's successful efforts to rid himself of the addiction create several spider-based powers.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #1 (1992)</ref> Stone hires the corporate mercenary Venture to capture O'Hara, now known by the name Spider-Man.

Venture does not succeed in his assignment.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #2-3 (1992)</ref>

Stone arranges for one of his employees — the assassin and Stark/Fujikawa Corporation field operative known as "The [[Specialist (comics)|Specialist]]" — to kidnap Kasey Nash in order to lure Miguel (as Spider-Man) into battle.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #4</ref> The Specialist was an expert martial artist, trained as a samurai warrior, and highly proficient with various martial arts weaponry.

==Other versions==
===Timestorm 2009-2099===
In the re-imagining of the 2099 universe called '[[Timestorm 2009-2099]]', Tyler maintains most of his original story; Miguel's half-brother becomes the future Scorpion instead of the future Venom. Alchemax is the de facto ruler of all of America. Stone sends Jake Gallows, a version of [[Punisher 2099]] back to the 'Heroic Age' to murder modern day heroes.

Now confined to a wheelchair, Tyler is being a major influence on the now much more insidious Miguel.<ref>''Secret Wars 2099'' #4</ref> While 2099's versions of the Avengers and the Defenders were fighting Martin Hargood (the 2099 descendant of [[Baron Mordo]]), Miguel was taking his father Tyler to a safe room where he revealed to have hired the assassin to kill Roberta. This revelation enraged Miguel, who threw Tyler out of a window in a fit of rage.<ref>''Secret Wars 2099'' #5</ref>
