==Fictional character biography==
In the [[Roman Empire]], Tyrannus claims to be a "[[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]]", but is actually a [[scientist]] far ahead of his time. He was exiled by [[King Arthur (Marvel Comics)|King Arthur]] and [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] to [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]], a network of caves and tunnels miles beneath the Earth's surface when he tries to conquer Britain. There Tyrannus discovers a race of orange-skinned semi-humanoid Subterraneans who are eager to find in him a new master to serve. He also discovers a pool of liquid which he drinks to maintain his youth through the centuries. The Subterraneans acquaint Tyrannus with examples and records of technology designed by the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] who were their original masters. Tyrannus' scientific genius enables him to master and improve upon the Deviants' scientific wonders over the centuries.  Tyrannus becomes Emperor of the Tyrannoid Subterraneans and an aspiring conqueror.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=309}}</ref>

In the modern era, Tyrannus is finally ready to use this technology and the Subterraneans in conquering the surface world. He makes several attempts as well as fighting wars against the forces of a new arrival in Subterranea, the [[Mole Man]].

Tyrannus woos Betty Ross underground and kidnaps her with his Tyrannoids. When the Hulk challenges him, he agrees to give her back on the condition that the Hulk performs a list of nigh-impossible menial tasks. However, eventually the Hulk completes the list and causes a lot of damage in the Kingdom, and Tyrannus is forced to honor his word.<ref>''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' #5 (January 1963)</ref> Tyrannus is reverted to an old man when the Mole Man captures his "fountain of youth". Tyrannus uses the Hulk as a pawn by teleporting him underground and recapturing the fountain. Banner succeeds in teleporting himself back.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #80-81</ref> Tyrannus forces scientist [[Cobalt Man|Ralph Roberts]] to design a gigantic robot for him to use in his war against the Mole Man, but is defeated by the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' #34</ref> He decides to gain revenge on the Hulk by using advanced technology to temporarily drive him into destructive rampages. He uses the Hulk and the robot Mogul as slaves in his war against the Mole Man.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #127</ref> He later secretly allies with [[Kala (comics)|Kala]] against the Mole Man.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #127-128</ref> Tyrannus projects his consciousness into a Subterranean, who attacks New York City but is thwarted by [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]].<ref>''Nova'' #5</ref>

In the guise of the aged Des, he became an ally of Prince Rey and the Keeper of the Flame of El Dorado, an immensely powerful cobalt energy "flame" that had been created in the Andes Mountains of South America by the Deviants and had been maintained by the people of the lost city of El Dorado. "Des" then captured the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #240</ref> "Des" was then restored to his youthfulness, and killed Rey and the Keeper.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #241</ref> Tyrannus then merged with the Flame, allowing his consciousness to control the Flame.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #242</ref> The Hulk destroys the machinery from which the Flame arises, and the Flame, still infused with Tyrannus's consciousness, is hurled far into outer space.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #243</ref>

The [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]'s atomized body later merges with the disembodied mind of Tyrannus. This gestalt being attempts to force Bruce Banner to cure this condition, but the procedure goes wrong, leaving Tyrannus' mind in the Abomination's body and returning Blonsky to a normal human form.<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #15</ref> Tyrannus briefly operates as the Abomination and attacks [[Wonder Man]],<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #25</ref> and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]],<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #12</ref> until [[Ghaur]] and [[Llyra]] free Tyrannus from the Abomination's body and restore him to human form; Tyrannus then adopted the guise of Dr. Tyrone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual #23''</ref> As Dr. Tyrone, he transformed a number of alcoholics and drug addicts into serpent men, and enslaved [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #9</ref> Tyrannus then battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Doctor Strange]]. He attempted to bring [[Father Set|Set]] to Earth, but was attacked by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] and swallowed by a serpent demon.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #4</ref>

Bruce Banner and [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] later fight Tyrannus when he and the Tyrannoids attack Manhattan.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #605</ref> Tyrannus's [[energy sword]] reappears in Banner's possession during the funeral for Hercules. He gives the sword to Amadeus Cho when they are forced to battle Nightmare and Phobos.<ref>''Hercules: Fall of an Avenger'' #2</ref>

Later when he tried to acquire Pandora's Box he acquired the help of Betty Ross (the Red She-Hulk) to help him in this endeavor by tricking the Hulk into opening the casing of the powerful artifact by thinking Betty was trapped inside, thus releasing its energies in the process.<ref>''The Incredible Hulks'' #626</ref> Later in the same story arc, Red She-Hulk is shown to not only run off with Tyrannus in her Red She-Hulk form but also sleeps with him,<ref>''The Incredible Hulks'' #630</ref> although she eventually returns to Hulk after reconciling her rebellious Hulk instincts with her human desires.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

==Powers and abilities==
Tyrannus was granted superhuman longevity and youth after drinking from the [[Fountain of Youth]] in [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]]; he is dependent on this fountain of youth to maintain his youth and immortality. He possesses various lingering [[psionic]] abilities after his merger with the cobalt "Flame of Life" in El Dorado, including telepathy, mind control of others, and the ability to drain the life force of others; these abilities have not been demonstrated in later appearances. He is an extraordinary scientific genius that Bruce Banner has acknowledged as superior to himself, and has achieved mastery of the advanced technology of the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] which he found in Subterranea, upon which he has made further advances. Tyrannus has limited mystic knowledge of sorcery.

Tyrannus often uses ancient Roman weaponry (e.g., swords and spears), but also has access to weapons created by Deviant technology, including guns projecting various types of radiation, and other advanced technological weaponry. He has designed other devices based on Deviant technology and his own innovations, which was manufactured by Subterraneans under his supervision. These include teleportation devices, flying vehicles, and gigantic earth-borers.
