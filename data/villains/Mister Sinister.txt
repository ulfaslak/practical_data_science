==Publication history==
===Creation===
Writer [[Chris Claremont]] conceived Sinister as a new villain for the [[X-Men]]. Having felt "tired of just going back to [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] and the same old same old" Claremont recalled:

{{blockquote|[[Dave Cockrum]] and I went over ideas, and what we were coming towards was a mysterious young boy—apparently an 11-year-old—at the orphanage where Scott ([[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]) was raised, who turned out to be the secret master of the place. In effect what we were setting up was a guy who was aging over a lifespan of roughly a thousand years. Even though he looked like an 11-year-old, he'd actually been alive since the mid-century at this point—he was actually about 50 [...] He had all the grown up urges. He's growing up in his mind but his body isn't capable of handling it, which makes him quite cranky. And, of course, looking like an 11-year-old, who'd take him seriously in the criminal community? [...] So he built himself an agent in a sense, which was Mister Sinister, that was, in effect, the rationale behind Sinister's rather—for want of a better word—childish or kid-like appearance. The costume... the look... the face... it's what would scare a child. Even when he was designed, he wasn't what you'd expect in a guy like that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?p=1411447#post1411447 |title=Comixfan Forum |publisher=comixfan.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>}}

Mister Sinister was first mentioned by the assassin [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] as the employer behind the team of assassins known as the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #212 (December 1986), which was part of the 1986 "[[Mutant Massacre]]" storyline, in which Sinister ordered the Marauders to kill the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]]s living beneath New York City.<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w), [[Leonardi, Rick]] (p).

''The Uncanny X-Men'' #213 (January 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref> Mister Sinister finally appeared on-panel in issue #221 (September 1987). The character plays a major role in the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" storyline, where it is revealed that Sinister cloned [[Madelyne Pryor]] from [[Jean Grey]] for the purpose of having her conceive a child with Cyclops, their son Nathan;<ref>Clarmeont, Chris (w) ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #241 (December 1988).

After a battle with the X-Men and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], the villain is apparently destroyed by Cyclops' optic beam.<ref>''X-Factor'' #39 (April 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The backup stories in the reprint series ''[[Classic X-Men]]'' #41–42 (Dec. 1989) detail the role Mister Sinister played in Cyclops' life at the orphanage in [[Nebraska]]. The story features a boy named Nathan who is obsessively fixated on Cyclops, which Claremont intended to actually be Mister Sinister. However, as Claremont left the ''X-Men'' comics, this origin was never revealed in-story.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cronin, Brian|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/11/23/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-78/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed | website= CBR.com|date=2006-11-23 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
{{expand section|date=May 2017}}
Born Nathaniel Essex in Victorian London, Sinister became a biologist in 1859. He was a contemporary of [[Charles Darwin]] and became obsessed with Darwin's theories. However, Essex believed his peers were shackled by too many moral constraints and that their research should be beyond morality. Essex believed that humanity was undergoing increasing mutation, due to what he called "Essex Factors" in the human genome. He dreamed of bringing the perfection of the evolution of the human race to the masses. After the loss of his young son due to birth defects, he delved deeper into his work. Essex's theories were mocked, making him bitter, and his revealing of an unorthodox experiment resulted in his ousting from the Royal Society. Angry, Essex stated that if becoming a monster was what was required for his work to progress, then he would become a monster.<ref name="Milligan">{{cite comic|writer=[[Peter Milligan]]|penciller=[[John Paul Leon]]|story=Beginnings|title=Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Vol 1 #4|date=September 1996|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Essex met with Cootie Tremble and the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], the group he would eventually lead. The Marauders kidnapped homeless and neglected people off the streets of London and used them as test subjects for Essex's experiments. Essex ordered the Marauders to awaken the immortal Egyptian mutant En Sabah Nur, who would become known as [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. En Sabah Nur ordered the Marauders to take him to Essex. During this time, Essex's wife, Rebecca Essex, was pregnant with their unborn child and was shocked to find that Essex had dug up their first-born child to experiment on him. Nur met Essex and became interested in Essex's work. Nur offered an alliance with Essex in continuing his research. Left with the choice of continuing his work or his wife shunning him, Essex allied himself with Nur. Essex explained to Nur that Nur was the first born in what he believed would be a great mutation in the human race.<ref name="Milligan"/>

The time-travelers [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]] confronted Nur, believing that they were to prevent Dr. Essex's future transformation into Mr. Sinister, but unaware that [[Madame Sanctity]] of the [[Askani]] had sent them to the past to stop Nur from conquering England. Essex was necessary for the birth of Nathan Summers, also known as the mutant [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], whom Madame Sanctity worshiped. Nur defeated Cyclops and Phoenix and leaves them for Essex to experiment on. Phoenix explains to Essex that continuing his work with Nur would lead to the destruction of the world. Deciding to leave his life of unorthodox research and dedicate his life to his wife and unborn child, Essex returned home to learn that his wife had freed all of his captives, prematurely had the baby, and was dying of stress. Asking for forgiveness at her side, Rebecca denied him and stated, "To me, you are... utterly… and contemptibly… sinister!", with her dying words. Essex agreed to Nur's offer and was ordered to create a plague to destroy the weak of the world, as Nur's first prelate. In his alien ship, Apocalypse painfully transformed Essex into an ageless being of extraordinary pallor with telekinesis, asking him to shed his past name and choose another. With his new abilities and dispassionate outlook, Essex took the new name, "Sinister", Rebecca's last words to him.<ref name="Milligan"/>

Sinister has shown an obsession with [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]], and the Summers genetic line. This led Sinister to create a clone of [[Jean Grey]] called [[Madelyne Pryor]], with the sole purpose of breeding with Scott. That successful quest resulted in the birth of [[Cable (comics)|Nathan Summers]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Chris Claremont]]|penciller=[[Marc Silvestri]]|story=Inferno, Part the Second: Fan the Flames!|title=Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 #241|date=February 1989|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

At some point, he is approached by Professor Xavier and Magneto regarding his genetic collection of DNA. Xavier wanted Sinister to prioritize collecting mutant DNA in a comprehensive database that would be safe, secure, and redundant. He offered to provide samples that Sinister would have trouble getting on his own including Magneto and himself. Sinister agreed to the compromise but had his memories erased of the encounter such that he would not remember meeting Xavier and Magneto.<ref>''Powers of X #4</ref>

===1990s===
Mister Sinister returns in the title ''X-Factor'', leading the [[Nasty Boys]]<ref>[[David, Peter]] (w). ''X-Factor'' #74–75 (Jan. – Feb. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> and has allied himself with the mutant terrorist [[Stryfe]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #78 (May 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> In the storyline "[[X-Cutioner's Song]]", the character impersonates Apocalypse and uses his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]] to capture Cyclops and Jean Grey.<ref>''X-Factor'' #84 (Nov. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> Sinister hands them over to Stryfe in exchange for a canister containing his genetic material,<ref>''X-Men'' #14 (Nov. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> but finds it empty, unknowingly unleashing the [[Legacy Virus]] in the process.<ref>''[[X-Force]]'' #18 (Jan. 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterwards, Sinister confronts Cyclops to reveal that the canister contained the deadly Legacy Virus. It was during this conversation, that Sinister said, "I care enough to wish you and your brothers to be protected from this illness", but he corrected himself in saying that he meant "brother".<ref>''X-Men'' #23 (Aug. 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In 1996, Mister Sinister's origin story is told in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], ''[[The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]''. It establishes the character as '''Nathaniel Essex''', a scientist from the 19th century obsessed with evolution who made a pact with the ancient mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] to become a virtually immortal being.<ref>''The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix'' #1–4 (June – Sept. 1996). Marvel Comics.</ref> It is furthermore establishes that Mister Sinister created Cyclops's son Nathan, who becomes the time-traveling soldier [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], in order to destroy Apocalypse.<ref>''Cable Annual'' 1999. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It was also revealed that Sinister had initiated the Morlock Massacre because he saw his signature in them (as many of them were experiments of [[Dark Beast]], a student of Mr. Sinister from an alternate timeline known as the [[Age of Apocalypse]]), and he would not allow unauthorized use of his theories, so they were slaughtered.<ref name="Cable28">''Cable'' vol. 1 #28. Marvel Comics.</ref> Though some of his Marauders did not survive the battle, many of them returned thanks to Sinister's genetics mastery and the fact that he had multiple clones of all of them.<ref name="X-Men34">''X-Men'' vol. 2 #34</ref> He also considered doing the same with the Genosha mutates, who were experiments of [[Sugar Man]] (another student of his Age of Apocalypse counterpart). Yet in the end he did not because the mutates were sterile and so in his opinion, they were not a tainting of his work.<ref name="Cable28"/>

Another running storyline for the character was his mysterious ties to the X-Man [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]; these ties were first introduced in ''X-Men'' v2 #6 when Sabretooth encountered Gambit and the X-Men and implied that the two had a history working together.<ref>''X-Men'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Rogue briefly absorbed Gambit's memories,<ref>''X-Men'' #41-45. Marvel Comics.</ref> she realized the relationship between the two: that Gambit had been an agent of Mister Sinister, recruiting Sabretooth and several other villains, to serve as Sinister's Marauders.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #350. Marvel Comics.</ref> Furthermore, he had served as a guide for the group in the tunnels, before abandoning the villains upon discovering their plans on wiping out the Morlocks. His payment for these deeds would be Mister Sinister's services as a scientist, to correct a genetic defect regarding Gambit's powers that was causing him to slowly lose control over them.<ref>''Gambit'' #13-15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2000s===
Mister Sinister appears in the title ''[[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'';<ref>''Gambit'' #14-23</ref> besides revealing the connection between the two characters, Mister Sinister would provide Gambit with a chemical compound designed to neutralize the genetic modification process that the Skrulls were using as part of their infiltration process of Earth, as the alien shapeshifters had formed an alliance with Apocalypse to conquer Earth.<ref>''Gambit'' 23, ''Uncanny X-Men'' #375. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was also revealed that Mister Sinister had genetically altered the villain the [[Living Monolith]], allowing him to access Havok's power, in order to serve as replacement for Havok in Apocalypse's plan to harvest the power of The Twelve.{{issue|date=November 2011}} Following Apocalypse's defeat, Sinister attempts to use the [[High Evolutionary]]'s space station to mutate the human population but is stopped by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #99. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sinister's actions would have worldwide repercussions: by helping High Evolutionary strip all of mutantkind of their powers, Sinister unknowingly wiped out a community of evolved mutants known as The Neo.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' 380. Marvel Comics.</ref> The surviving Neo began hunting Sinister down, forcing Sinister to go into hiding as the Neo known as Domina (whose daughter was one of the dead) kills over 17 Sinister doppelgangers left behind by Sinister as he goes into hiding.<ref>''X-Men'' #103. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sinister would resurface in the pages of ''[[Weapon X]]'', experimenting on mutants under the guise of Dr. Robert Windsor.<ref>''Weapon X'' (2002), #2</ref> It is revealed that the character [[Nazi human experimentation|worked alongside the Nazis]] during [[World War II]] and created a clone of [[Namor]] called N2 which was destroyed by Captain America.<ref>''Weapon X'' (2002) #14</ref> He would be accompanied by the Marauder Scalphunter in the series, with Scalphunter serving as his bodyguard.

Mister Sinister reappears in the "[[X-Men: Endangered Species]]" storyline, sending the Marauders and [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] out to murder all those who have knowledge of the future;<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #203</ref> In the "[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]" storyline, Sinister, leading a mob of many of the remaining evil mutants, seeks out the first mutant child born since [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] (also known as "M-Day", when the Scarlet Witch de-powered most of the world's mutant population). However, the character is apparently killed by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who presses his face onto an unconscious [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], whose powers had been amplified into an instantaneous death-touch.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #46. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Some years ago, Kraven made a deal with Mister Sinister. He and the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] tracked down the X-Men, and they fought the united forces of Spider-Man and the original X-Men. Kraven fled after a short battle, but not before wounding each member of the X-Men. Kraven returned to Sinister, with genetic samples from [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. Furthermore, Sinister requested a sample of his [[DNA]].<ref name="ReferenceA">''X-Men/Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mister Sinister later cut a deal with [[Cletus Kasady|Carnage]] in order to obtain a sample of the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]]. After removing the sentience from the Carnage symbiote sample, Mister Sinister combined it with the DNA of the original X-Men and Kraven the Hunter where he will use this creation on a later date.<ref name="ReferenceB">''X-Men/Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Years later after the death of Kraven, an [[Morlocks (comics)|ex-Morlock]] who had kept his powers post [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] named Joe Buggs was murdered by a mysterious [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] hunter. His friend Ed (who had lost his powers) went to the X-Men for help. He claimed that the man who killed Buggs was Kraven the Hunter. Although they were skeptical about Kraven's apparent resurrection, the X-Men called on the help of Spider-Man, who had battled Kraven many times over the years. After discussing the battle that they had with Kraven years ago and the fact that he had given samples of the X-Men's DNA to Sinister for cloning, the lights went out on the wing where they were located. The hunter attacked and quickly dispatched [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] but was held at bay by Spider-Man's webbing. He broke free claiming his name is Xraven as was able to defeat Cyclops and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], holding her hostage, giving the ultimatum that he would kill her if they did not surrender. Spider-Man insulted Xraven, claiming that Kraven would never threaten a helpless girl. Xraven was momentarily fazed by his comment, but attacked again, claiming that he is the "favored one". Cyclops realizes Xraven's weakness and tells him that Mister Sinister sees him as nothing but a pawn. He tells Xraven to read his mind, in order for him to see the kind of a man Sinister really is. After Xraven sees Cyclops' memories, he flees but the X-Men become aware of the fact that he was able to get DNA samples from Shadowcat, Colossus, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Returning to Mister Sinister with the samples, Mister Sinister tells him that he planned to [[cloning|clone]] a new generation of mutants, and that he would unite all mutantkind. After seeing what Sinister's real intentions were in Cyclops' memories, Xraven destroys the samples, claiming that Mister Sinister would breed slaves as opposed to warriors, and Xraven attacks him.<ref name="ReferenceC">''X-Men/Spider-Man'' #4.

====Miss Sinister====
{{split section|Miss Sinister|Talk:Mister Sinister#Splitting Miss Sinister|date=May 2019}}
[[image:Miss sinister.png|thumb|upright|Miss Sinister in ''X-Men Legacy'' #214 (September 2008). Art by Scot Eaton.]]
The series ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' reveals that Mister Sinister had been anticipating his physical death for some time, putting events in motion that would lead to his resurrection. It was even revealed that besides the Summers family, Mister Sinister had also been manipulating for some time events in the Xavier family as well as the Marko, Ryking and Shaw families. By using the Cronus Device, he manages to implant within their DNA the seeds through which to ensure his own rebirth. Then he transferred his own consciousness and powers to the machine which after his death would activate itself and his consciousness would take control over the body with his DNA imprint.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #211. Marvel Comics.</ref> When that happened, Sinister's consciousness took control over Professor Xavier's body to save him from a gunshot wound.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #213. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the combined efforts of [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] and Gambit destroy the machine, enabling Xavier to successfully drive Sinister's consciousness from his mind and body. At the end, a female character appears called '''Miss Sinister'''.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #214. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her name is revealed to be Claudine Renko, and she possesses telepathy and a healing factor similar to Sinister, but not all the memories or mind due to the fact that she was engineered to be Mister Sinister's fail-safe in the event of the Cronus Device would fail. When that ultimately occurred, Claudine was activated.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #217. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later [[X-23]] (Laura Kinney), flanked by Gambit, encounters a young girl named Alice and witnesses her being murdered, though the next day Alice appears to them somehow alive. Encouraging them to follow her to a peculiar desert laboratory, Alice introduces them to her employer/owner/adoptive mother, Claudine. Revealing herself openly to X-23, Claudine explains that Alice is also a clone, fourth of a series of five created by Essex as another experiment alongside several other children that live in the complex.{{issue|date=July 2018}} Claudine later on approaches Gambit and the latter having left the X-Men's base to strike out on her own, seemingly asking for the former's help. Claudine at this point seems to be suffering from injuries inflicted earlier by Wolverine's son [[Daken]]. A near fatal strike from X-23 reveals the nature of the injury as Claudine's body morphs into that of Mister Sinister.<ref>''X-23'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mister Sinister then incapacitates Gambit and X-23 but is quickly re-absorbed back into Miss Sinister who then straps X-23 to a peculiar chair and expands upon her own origins, stating that while everyone believes her to be merely a clone of the mad scientist, in truth she actually was an ordinary woman with her own personality, mind and dreams, but in her search for immortality she allowed herself to be infected with a virus which would grant her a healing factor, however while the virus was apparently ineffective, Claudine would learn later that the virus actually was engineered to transform her into a host of Mister Sinister as it contained his own DNA and thus his immensely powerful telepathic powers, which would lead to his resurrection. When the Cronus Device failed, the virus was automatically activated and Claudine was compelled to go to the laboratory in the desert, where she would be used as a host for Essex. Claudine believed she had been able to stop the process, possessing only vague, but invasive memories of Essex's life, but learned later that she had only delayed the inevitable. Now everything that makes Claudine is being swallowed by the malignant presence of Essex within her mind, and in order to free herself of Sinister and prevent her own death, she aims to switch bodies with X-23, thus inheriting Laura's healing factor, something she had always wanted. The plan backfires when Essex controls Laura's body and uses her to mortally wound Claudine again. Laura manages to overcome Essex's presence in her mind, expelling it through force of will. Laura, Alice and Gambit manage to escape the laboratory as it collapses and arrange for the children to be given new homes before setting off on their journey again. However, in the wreckage left behind, Claudine is still alive, although just barely, and is being watched over by the fifth Alice clone, the new host of Essex.<ref>''X-23'' #4-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When next seen Miss Sinister found herself within the company of the [[Ultimate X-Men|reality displaced X-Men]] of a dead universe. One in particular who came into her graces by the name of [[Jimmy Hudson]] had been hiding a secret within his D.N.A., a sort of genetic anomaly that would enable her to create and control spontaneous mutation with time to experiment on it.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #4 (2017)</ref> Over the following months Claudine would find that this substance called '''Mothervine''' was originally conceived for the purpose of controlled mutant child births, after further study she found it could also be used to cause further advancement evolution's within natural born mutants or trigger mutation in non-mutants.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #7, 28 (2017)</ref> But the secondary and primary mutations caused were debilitating to the point of being lethal, a great many she tested it on would die during the procedure.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #12 (2017)</ref>

===2010s===
[[image:Mister Sinister.png|thumb|upright|Mister Sinister in ''Extraordinary X-Men'' #2 (January 2016). Art by Humberto Ramos and Victor Olazaba.]]
Mister Sinister was eventually able to fully possess the fifth clone of Alice as he resurfaced in the pages of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #544. Now dressed in Victorian era garb and using his knowledge gained from Apocalypse, he merges with the Dreaming Celestial and warps its head to match his own, using the power he gained as a result to turn San Francisco's residents into doppelgangers of himself resembling 19th century England, where he believes society was perfect. His plan is to disturb the Celestials so that they would come to Earth and eradicate all life, leaving only his perfection to rebuild the planet. However, Sinister is defeated and forced out from San Francisco.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]" storyline, Mister Sinister is discovered to have built his own city (based on Victorian-era London) in the Moloids' tunnels within [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]]. The city is inhabited solely by clones of Mister Sinister and his various acquaintances, including Cyclops, Madelyne Pryor, Gambit, Mystique and Krakoa. Also populating the city are clones of the Phalanx, clones of Sabretooth called "Hounds", and clones of the Marauders, who function as Battalion Guards. After disposing of a rebel clone, he explains to one of his other clones that he has foreseen that the Phoenix Force would come after [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], and that the Avengers would try to stop it and clash with the X-Men, resulting in the Phoenix Five. He also knows that the Phoenix Five will soon come after him and intends to take the Phoenix energy away from them by using a group of [[Madelyne Pryor]] clones.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During a meeting of the Extinction Team, the Phoenix Five reveal to Magneto, Storm, Psylocke and Danger (who is still controlled by UNIT) that Mister Sinister is the one who told Hope about the Phoenix Force, and ponder on the danger that his goals may represent to the world. The Phoenix Five leave their teammates behind and track Mister Sinister to [[Anchorage, Alaska]] (Cyclops's birthplace) finding out that he built his city in the tunnels beneath Anchorage. Mister Sinister has also formed his cloned army. He then orders his clones to enter into war against the Phoenix Five.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 2 #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> One by one, the Phoenix Five members are taken down by Mister Sinister's cloned creatures (including a clone of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Krakoa|Krakoa]]) until only Cyclops remains, and even he is eventually defeated by the Madelyne Pryor clones. Shortly after, Magneto, Storm, Psylocke and Danger arrive at Mister Sinister's city and find out that their teammates were captured.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 2 #16</ref> However, the Phoenix Five are able to escape and decide to kill each and every clone of Sinister, ending the threat he posed to mutantkind.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 2 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Yet in the aftermath of "Avengers vs. X-Men," it is revealed that the threat of Sinister still goes on as he appears alive and well when he engages in a tête-à-tête with an imprisoned Cyclops. Sinister tells Cyclops that he had actually thought he could indeed keep the Phoenix chained, yet as confident as he was it was always possible there were holes in his data set. And so, before all that, at some point he surprised Katie Kildare, Cyclops' PR agent, and killed her. He then created a para-personality of her, took Katie's position in Utopia and left a secondary Sinister in charge of his kingdom. Sinister also reveals that the para-personality he created of Katie would only dissolve once the Phoenix had gone and his own would reemerge. Sinister even provides a final dilemma for Cyclops to think about: Sinister may have lost his empire, his blessed creation engines, his backups, his Madelynes. He is on his own, but Cyclops just knows that no one else can stop him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It is later revealed that Sinister managed to infiltrate the Jean Grey School through one of its students, [[Ernst (comics)|Ernst]]. Ernst provided Sinister with access to DNA samples from the mutants within the institute in exchange for providing her friend Martha Johannesen with a new body. His efforts were ultimately foiled by the students and Spider-Man, whose help was sought by Logan after the latter had become aware of the mole's existence. Sinister manages to escape although his samples are destroyed.<ref>''Spider-Man and the X-Men'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Last Days" part of the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, it was mentioned months ago that Mister Sinister was among the scientists that Magneto's right-hand person Briar tried to contact in order to make a special cocktail to augment Magneto's powers for the upcoming incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===All New, All Different===
With the release of the Terrigen Mist in the atmosphere of the Earth, it was discovered to be toxic to mutants after sustained exposure.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #1</ref> Mr. Sinister began experimenting on unwilling subjects, trying to make Inhuman and Mutant DNA co-exist in order to allow the creation of a genetically superior species of mutants. Sinister caught the attention of the X-Men after the disappearance of Colossus and Magik at the hands of the Marauders. When Sinister was confronted by the group of mutants, he deployed his only successful specimen, the seemingly-revived Cyclops. It is also revealed that he has several clones of Gambit, Cyclops, Cannonball, Sabretooth, Mystique, and several others which he maintains locked as his prize collection.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #4</ref> The revived Cyclops was, however, revealed to be actually another experiment of Sinister who combined Scott Summers' genetic material with Inhuman DNA. Mister Sinister soon discovers that the clone is unstable when the Inhuman DNA began overtaking the mutant DNA, and that the mutant race would therefore be doomed in the weeks to come. After the Cyclops clone is defeated and lifted high enough to explode, Mister Sinister is defeated by Colossus and Magik and handed over to the authorities.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #5</ref>

During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Mister Sinister crashes the auction in a submarine off the coast of Guam and attacks an unidentified seller for stealing the genetic material of the original Wolverine. The attack causes a hole in the submarine causing Spider-Man and Jessica Jones to use a combination of Spider-Man's webbing and Luke Cage to plug up the hole. As Tony Stark becomes Iron Man to save the seller from Mister Sinister, X-23 sheds her disguise and assists Iron Man in fighting Mister Sinister where she manages to slice off Mister Sinister's left hand.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: The Adamantium Agenda'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After X-23 cuts off Mister Sinister's other hand causing him to retreat, the auction attendees are evacuated to [[South Korea]]'s National Intelligence Service Helicarrier as Iron Man, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Spider-Man and X-23 interrogate the seller whose name is Declan Fay. He directs them to the [[Kerguelen Islands]] where Mister Sinister is putting together a database. Upon arrival in special Iron Man armors and taking out the guards, Iron Man's group discovers that Mister Sinister has collected the genetic make-up of every person on Earth.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: The Adamantium Agenda'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mister Sinister attacks them where he has the appearance of having been attacked. After being stabbed by X-23, Mister Sinister revealed that a killteam showed up and stole his work while also revealing that he does not have Wolverine's body. When Mister Sinister claims to Iron Man that he is a man of science and to ignore his achievements would be scientific terrorism, Iron Man, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Spider-Man, and X-23 destroy the database before escaping.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: The Adamantium Agenda'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mister Sinister has since become obsessed with Iceman's newfound control and versatility of his abilities, kidnapping even the Morlock known as Ash and turning him into a mutant-fighting monster to pit against Bobby.<ref>''Iceman (2018)'' #2</ref>

===Powers of X===
Its revealed that at some point in the past, Sinister was approached by Professor Xavier and Magneto regarding the genetic collection of mutant DNA that he had acquired over the years. Xavier wanted Sinister's help in prioritizing all the material he had into a comprehensive database that would be safe, secure, and redundant. He offered to provide samples that Sinister would have trouble getting on his own including Magneto and himself. Mister Sinister was not interested in the deal but was suddenly killed by another Sinister who was enticed by the proposal since he himself possessed a functional X-Gene. Sinister agreed to the compromise but ended up having his memories of the encounter repressed so he would be sent on his course without knowing Xavier and Magneto's involvement until the day they tell him to remember.<ref>''Powers of X'' #4</ref> Along with other mutant villains, Sinister is welcomed to Krakoa by Xavier, Magneto, and Apocalypse. He joins the Quiet Council of Krakoa.<ref>''House of X'' #6</ref>

===Dawn of X===
However, it is not long before he finds himself bored with his status, and decided to resume his mutant DNA harvest for various nefarious purposes, but now, with the new laws of Krakoa established, Sinister cannot go about his usual business. While he is now bound by Professor X and the Quiet Council to obey their rules, he has found some wiggle room to play, setting his sights on a file about Franklin Richards.<ref>''Incoming'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
While technically Mister Sinister is a genetically-altered human with superhuman physical and mental abilities, he effectively becomes a mutant himself due to his own genetic manipulation.<ref>''Powers of X'' #6</ref> The character is telepathic, able to manipulate the minds of others in various ways, and is capable of energy projection through [[telekinesis]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #39</ref> Using genetic material from the mutant Courier, Mister Sinister gained complete control of his body at the cellular level, allowing him to shape-shift,<ref>''Gambit'' #14</ref> regenerate,<ref name="X-Men #23">''X-Men'' vol. 2 #23</ref> be virtually immune to injuries,<ref name="X-Men #23"/><ref>''X-Force'' #16</ref> and have a prolonged lifespan.<ref name="Milligan"/> Mister Sinister has exhibited the ability to teleport, though [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] believes this is accomplished through his [[tesseract]] headquarters.<ref name="X-Men34"/>

Mister Sinister is also a scientific [[genius]], with expertise in the fields of [[biology]], [[genetics]], [[cloning]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]]. The character is a master manipulator and planner, with decades of genetic research at his command. He goes to great lengths to preserve his powers and personality through elaborate technological means such as conditioning certain children to be his 'hosts' in the event of his future death. However, [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] noted that the later discovery of cloning technology would make such a plan relatively pointless, reflecting that Sinister tends to continue pursuing old plans even when future technology offers more viable alternatives.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}
