==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=February 2016}}
Malus first appeared in ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' # 30 and was created by [[Michael Fleisher]], [[Steve Leialoha]] and [[Jim Mooney]]. He was featured several times opposite of Captain America and Sam Wilson as Captain America. He was also briefly a member of the [[Frightful Four]].<ref>''Superior Carnage'' #1-5</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Karl Malus was born in Mud Butte, [[South Dakota]]. He became a [[surgeon]] and researcher. He was later the founder of the Institute for Supranormality Research and became a criminal [[scientist]].

In his first appearance, Malus was performing illegal medical experiments on human beings, funded by the criminal [[Enforcer (comics)|Enforcer]], in order to find out more about [[superhuman]]s and their abilities. He was approached by the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]], a [[supervillain]] who was losing his powers. Malus sent the Human Fly to steal some equipment, attracting the attention of the original [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]. Since Spider-Woman's friend Scotty McDowell had been rendered comatose by one of the Enforcer's poison bullets, Malus offered to cure McDowell in exchange for leniency.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #30</ref> Spider-Woman agreed, but while curing McDowell, Malus also experimented on him using the Fly's DNA, which would later cause McDowell to transform into the villainous [[Hornet (comics)#Hornet (Scotty McDowell)|Hornet]]. Malus went to prison, but was released in order to "help" authorities against the threat of the Hornet. In actuality, he wanted to capture and study Spider-Woman. Malus slipped away, and made contact with the Hornet, whom he kept drugged and aggressive for his own purposes.

Malus then contacted [[Werewolf by Night|Jack Russell]], a man cursed with [[lycanthropy]], and told him he could help cure his transformations into a [[werewolf]]. Instead, he placed a control collar on Russell and sent both Hornet and the Werewolf after Spider-Woman. She was able to defeat both of them, and freed the Werewolf, who then attacked Malus.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #31-32</ref>

Malus had studied the bizarre criminal [[Daddy Longlegs (comics)|Daddy Longlegs]], who had gained his powers from a modified growth-serum used by [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]], and had thus acquired a sample of [[Pym Particles]], which could alter a person's size and mass. With this knowledge, Malus hoped to restore the powers of [[Erik Josten]]. He gave Josten growth powers and enhanced strength turning him into the supervillain [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]], but Goliath rejected Malus' offer of partnership and was in turn defeated by the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''[[Iron Man]] Annual'' #7</ref>

Malus also transformed Antonio Rodriguez into the [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]] by combining his human genes with the genetic material of an armadillo. Malus encountered [[Captain America]] soon after that.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' #308</ref>

Eventually, Malus went to work for the [[Power Broker]] Curtiss Jackson using his technology to augment the strength of paying customers to superhuman levels. The strength augmenting process was tremendously risky with half the subjects dying or becoming severely deformed, but this information was kept a closely guarded secret. Power Broker and Malus also used highly addictive drugs on their subjects, telling them that the chemical was necessary to stabilize their powers, but in fact it only served to keep the subjects working for—and paying—the Power Broker. One such victim was [[Sharon Ventura]], who was also sexually abused while drugged.<ref>''Thing'' #35</ref> Many wrestlers of the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]], which is only open to those with super-strength, have used the Power Broker's services, and wound up indebted to them.

Malus soon almost strength-augmented Captain America, but was overpowered by [[Demolition Man (comics)|D-Man]].<ref>''Captain America'' #328</ref> He escaped with Captain America from the sealed Power Broker laboratory, but was captured by the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]].<ref>''Captain America'' #329-330</ref>

When Power Broker, Inc. was attacked by the vigilante known as [[Scourge of the Underworld]], Curtiss Jackson was exposed to his own augmentation device in order to try to gain super-strength to defend himself. The process went awry, leaving him so grotesquely muscle-bound that he could not move. Malus decided to take advantage of this situation by using [[Bludgeon (comics)|Bludgeon]] and [[Mangler (comics)|Mangler]] to abduct [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]]. Malus sent Vagabond, who knew Jackson, to obtain a copy of his [[fingerprint]]s so that Malus could access all of Jackson's personal accounts and vaults. He used an explosive wristband to force Vagabond's cooperation, but she managed to knock Malus out, destroy the fingerprint mold, place the band on his wrist, and inject him with the drug he had planned to use on her.<ref>''Captain America'' #363-364</ref>

Malus then attempted to learn the secret of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]'s prowess and [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]]'s invulnerability. Malus fought [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] alongside Triphammer, Pick-Axe, Vice and Handsaw.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #29</ref>

The Power Broker had Malus' legs broken for his betrayal, then promptly re-hired him to try to cure the Power Broker's condition. Malus captured and experimented on several augmented individuals to perfect the de-augmentation process, including [[Battlestar (comics)|Battlestar]], which drew the involvement of the [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]]. Together, Battlestar and the Agent freed the captured wrestlers, and forced Malus to restore their strength. The U.S. Agent then destroyed Malus' equipment and records.<ref>''Captain America'' #375-378</ref>

Malus has since worked for a variety of criminal organizations, including the Corporation,{{Issue|date=August 2009}} and the Maggia.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} He even worked with the Avengers and the Thunderbolts in their efforts to defeat [[Count Nefaria]] in exchange for a reduced sentence.<ref>''Avengers'' #32 - 34 (vol. 2, Sept. - Nov. 2000) and ''Thunderbolts'' #42 - 43 (Sept. - Oct 2000)</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Karl Malus was researched by Quasimodo as part of its work for [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].<ref>''Dark Reign Files'' #1</ref>

Karl Malus was recruited by the Wizard to become a new member of the [[Frightful Four]], only to find himself being forcibly made the new host of the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]].<ref>Superior Carnage #2</ref> He was eaten by Carnage who was possessing [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] at the time.<ref>''Superior Carnage'' #5</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Karl Malus returned following his devouring by Carnage. Malus explained that he was indeed eaten by Carnage, but somehow was able to pull himself back together once deposited as waste. As a human/Symbiote hybrid, Malus now exhibits symbiote-like abilities and behavior.<ref name="Captain America: Sam Wilson #3">''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #3</ref> Since this incident, he continued his experiments on humans as an employee of Serpent Solutions as seen in their flashback.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #4</ref> Most of Karl Malus's experiments were on illegal immigrants that were given to him by the [[Sons of the Serpent]] upon apprehending them at the Mexican border.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #2</ref> The experiments he performed on them turned them into animal hybrids. When Captain America tracked his operations down, Karl Malus used his symbiotic abilities to subdue Captain America and experiment on him which turned Captain America into a werewolf. Using Redwing's DNA, Karl Malus turned a Mexican teenager named Joaquin Torres into a bird/human hybrid. Upon being liberated by [[Misty Knight]], Captain America followed and subdued Karl Malus by using Redwing's high-pitched sounds on him and remanded him to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. While Captain America and the others that were experimented upon by Karl Malus were restored to normal, Joaquin was unable to be restored to normal due to Redwing's DNA being vampiric which granted him a healing factor.<ref name="Captain America: Sam Wilson #3"/>
