===Massacrer Casino===

===Dungeon Murderworld===

Realizing that mercenaries have less to fight for than heroes who always escape his traps, Arcade put out an add for them and lured them into a castle-dungeon role playing situation. Most notably Gwenpool and her friends Batrock the leaper, MegaTony, and the Terrible Eye (a.k.a. Sarah), a group of mutant-frog mercenaries Batroc worked with once (much to his chagrin), and Deadpool (referred to as "The Unkillable beast" and wearing a green Robinhood style cap). Things went downhill quickly however since Gwen was a geek back in her home world and thus knew all the tricks of working her way through an RPG with record speed, especially after she killed the shopkeeper-robot who offered to sell them dungeon raiding equipment and just took what she wanted, including their own gear. A good thing since Deadpool and, according to Arcade, many other mercenaries had been trapped and died there over a long period of time. After a brief misunderstanding with Deadpool she quickly led him and her team to Arcade's hiding place and took him down.

==In other media==

===Television===
* In the [[X-Men: Evolution]], Webber Torque (or "Arcade", as he calls himself), a student from [[Bayville High School]], once managed to infiltrate the [[Xavier Institute]]'s [[Danger Room]]. Mistakenly believing it was a video game simulation, he altered it into a Murderworld.
* Murderworld appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Game Over." Here, it has been named '''Madland'''. Spider-Man, Captain America, and Wolverine had to traverse through Madland's Murderworld location in order to get to Arcade so that they can prevent him from starting [[World War III]].

===Video Games===
* Murderworld is the setting for [[X-Men: Madness in Murderworld]], a single-player side-scrolling arcade game developed by Paragon Software in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|title=X-Men: Madness in Murderworld|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/x-men-madness-in-murderworld/3030-7150/|publisher=[[Giant Bomb]]}}</ref>
* Murderworld appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. When the heroes used [[Doctor Strange]]'s [[Orb of Agamotto|Orb of Teleportation]] to travel to [[Latveria|Castle Doom]], they were diverted by [[Baron Mordo]] to Murderworld where they arrived in a fake Castle Doom. It was also revealed that Arcade has [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] in Murderworld and Jean Grey was shown to be under Arcade's mind-control when found in a tent. The heroes fought their way through [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] where they end up fighting Arcade in his Arcade-Bot. Some of the Simulation Disks take place in Murderworld. In [[Deadpool]]'s disk, he is irritated greatly by Deadpool's refusal to accept that Murderworld isn't a normal theme park (although this probably is Deadpool's taunting rather than an actual lack of understanding, Deadpool's borderline insanity makes this uncertain), and forcing the mercenary to fight Dark Spider-Man (who Arcade referred to as his creation). In [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s disk, Arcade was threatening Black Panther to give the secret codes to Wakanda's vibranium facility (which of course he doesn't tell) and forcing Black Panther to fight Dark [[Captain America]]. Storm's disk has her fight against [[Hussar (comics)|Hussa]] in Murderworld. The versus [[Mysterio]] simulator take place in Murderworld. [[Mister Fantastic]]'s disk has his fight against [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]] in Murderworld.
