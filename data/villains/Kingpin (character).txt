The '''Kingpin''' ('''Wilson Fisk''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita Sr.]], and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #50 ([[cover-date]]d [[1967 in comics#July|July 1967]]).

One of the most feared and powerful crime bosses in the [[Marvel Universe]] by typically holding the position of [[New York City]]'s crime overlord, he was initially an adversary of [[Spider-Man]], and later went on to become the [[arch-enemy]] of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]],<ref name="top 5 enemies of Daredevil">Furious, Nick (January 25, 2011). [http://www.comicbooked.com/top-5-enemies-of-daredevil "The Top 5 Enemies of Daredevil"]. comicbooked.com</ref> as well as a recurring foe of the [[Punisher]]. The Kingpin's signature look is his extraordinarily heavyset appearance with most of his mass consisting of muscle while usually wearing a white suit jacket and carrying a cane which he tips with diamonds or other hard substances as necessary to aid in physical combat. The "Kingpin" name is a reference to the [[Boss (crime)|crimelord]] title in [[American Mafia|Mafia]] slang nomenclature.

[[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains Of All Time List ranked the Kingpin as number 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/10.html |title=Kingpin is Number 10 |publisher=[[IGN]]|date= |accessdate=2015-04-20}}</ref> Wilson Fisk has been portrayed by [[John Rhys-Davies]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and voiced by [[Liev Schreiber]] in ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.

==Publication history==
The Kingpin first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #50 (July 1967), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]],<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 40|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Although he made his debut in the previous issue, it was in this [Stan] Lee and [John] Romita tale [''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #51] that the Kingpin – real name Wilson Fisk – really left his mark on organized crime.}}</ref> who based his physical appearance on actor [[Sydney Greenstreet]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Alan|title=Spider-Man Chronicle: A Year by Year Visual History|date=October 1, 2012|publisher=Dk Pub|isbn=9780756692360}}</ref>

In his debut [[story arc]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50–52, the Kingpin is portrayed purely as a crimelord, albeit one who tends to be unusually hands-on in his criminal dealings.<ref name="Comtois30">{{cite book|last=Comtois|first=Pierre|title=Marvel Comics in the 80s: An Issue by Issue Field Guide to a Pop Culture Phenomenon|date=December 2014|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|page=30}}</ref> In his subsequent appearances, also written by Lee, he becomes more of a typical supervillain, employing fantastic devices to further his criminal capers.<ref name="Comtois30"/> In the early 1980s, the character evolved further. A series of appearances in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' by writer/penciler [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] depicted the Kingpin as a scheming, cold-blooded crimelord who consistently stayed beyond the reach of the law. This remained the character's dominant form for decades<ref name="Comtois30"/> as the Kingpin became widely regarded as Daredevil's [[archenemy]].<ref name="top 5 enemies of Daredevil"/> He continues to be a recurring opponent of [[Spider-Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Punisher]].

==Fictional character biography==
Wilson Fisk began his life as a poor child in [[New York City]], [[bullying|bullied]] by his classmates due to his obesity. Fisk began training himself in physical combat, using his new-found strength to intimidate the bullies into joining his [[gang]]. He was eventually discovered by crimelord Don Rigoletto, and became the man's [[bodyguard]] and right-hand man. Eventually, Fisk killed his boss and took control of the gangster's criminal empire, becoming one of the most powerful figures in New York's underworld.<ref>''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #-1. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was later revealed during this time that he became friends with a fellow crime family member named [[Miles Morales#Other versions|Miles Morales]] who saved his life in prison.<ref>''Spider-Men II'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While the Kingpin enjoyed a long tenure in his new position, he had made enemies such as the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] [[crime syndicate]] and the terrorist group [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. The two groups teamed together to oppose Fisk, causing him to flee to [[Japan]]. There, he started a [[spice]] business in order to regain his wealth. After earning enough money, Fisk returned to New York and started gang wars in an attempt to bring down the Maggia. With the criminal world in chaos, Fisk was able to step in and take back control.{{issue|date=January 2015}}

Fisk attempted a coalition of the New York mobs after hearing that Spider-Man had apparently gone out of action and ordered the abduction of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], but was foiled by [[Spider-Man]] in his first confrontation with the web-slinger.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50-52. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While Fisk was a powerful crimelord, he posed as a legitimate businessman, one who made donations to [[charitable organization|charities]], and seemed like a generous, wealthy man. He eventually met and then married a woman named [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa]], with whom he had a son: [[Richard Fisk]]. Vanessa did not know that Fisk was a criminal when they married. Vanessa (having found out) threatened to leave him if he did not give up his life of crime. He retired from crime, and the family moved back to Japan.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 1 #170-171. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Richard did not find out that his father was a criminal until [[college]]. After graduating, Richard told his parents he would travel through [[Europe]]. Only months later, they received news that Richard (who was angry after learning the truth about his father) had died in a [[ski|skiing accident]]. However, it turned out that Richard was still alive and masqueraded as a rival crimelord known as the Schemer, intent on toppling his father as the Kingpin of Crime.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #83-85">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #83-85. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fisk contended against his rival gang leader, the Schemer, and battled Spider-Man in this encounter.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #83-85"/>

At one point, he became the manager and director of a Las Vegas-based fragment of HYDRA.<ref name="Captain America' 1972">''Captain America'' #147-148 (March–April 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref>

At his wife's behest, Fisk later divested himself of his criminal empire. He unsuccessfully attempted to kill Spider-Man once more before retiring from crime.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #196-197 (October 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===1980s===

To complete his reformation, the Kingpin agreed to turn over his files to the authorities, incriminating his former lieutenants. His wife Vanessa was then kidnapped by said lieutenants who put out a contract on his life. After he witnessed Vanessa's apparent death, he returned to a life of crime. He regained control of the New York mobs because he had built them up in the first place and knew how to damage them; promises to keep the East Coast stable kept Midwestern crimelords happy and allowed him room to move. The Kingpin also gained [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]'s loyalty by promising steady work. The files were taken by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]; the Kingpin encouraged Daredevil to turn them over to the police as that would allow him to replace the arrested crimelords that much swifter. Daredevil did not turn them over because this would slow down the Kingpin's plans.<ref>''Daredevil'' #170-172 (May–June 1981). Marvel Comics</ref> Kingpin maneuvered Daredevil into battling the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #174-175 (September–October 1981). Marvel Comics.</ref> He secretly promoted mayoral candidate Randolph Cherryh. He then hired [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] as his assassin. Daredevil found Vanessa alive but amnesiac and returned Vanessa to him in exchange for his abandoning the Cherryh scheme. As retribution for this, he sent Elektra to kill [[Foggy Nelson]] (Daredevil's friend) but Elektra failed and was killed by Bullseye.<ref>''Daredevil'' #177-178 and #180-181. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Kingpin learned Daredevil's secret identity through information passed on from [[Karen Page]], Daredevil's ex-girlfriend who was now a pornographic film actress. The Kingpin used his influence to [[Daredevil: Born Again|destroy]] Matt Murdock's civilian and professional life. Enamored with the results of his own scheme, he became increasingly obsessed with Daredevil. This led to (among other events) brutalizing the reporter [[Ben Urich]], having his employees (such as [[James Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]] and [[Felix Manning]]) assaulting bribed policeman [[Nick Manolis]] and sending the homicidal patriot [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] into Hell's Kitchen. The last incident killed dozens of people, and the Kingpin was implicated. Though he avoided prison, his reputation was destroyed.<ref>''Daredevil: Born Again'' / ''Daredevil'' #227-233 (February–August 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kingpin was sought out by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] (who was dating Spider-Man at the time) and feared a lack of powers would make the woman a liability to him. Black Cat paid Fisk to have scientists provide defensive bad luck powers that cause mishap to befall anyone who attempts to harm Black Cat in combat but also hurt and eventually kill anyone who stays nearby. The Kingpin hoped this would lead to Spider-Man's death, but Spider-Man and the Black Cat ultimately broke up instead. Shortly after, Fisk was attacked by Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #100 (March 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> Fisk's scientists also created the supervillains the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]] and the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] to battle Spider-Man and the Black Cat.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===1990s===
Fisk later rehires Bullseye to investigate a New York drug war and survives an assassination attempt by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. In retaliation, he sends Bullseye to assassinate the [[Red Skull]] (Crossbones's employer). The attempt fails, and the Kingpin instead defeats the Red Skull (in a clone of Captain America's body) in personal combat.<ref>''Captain America'' #373 and #376-378 (1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fisk subsequently begins his own cable television station, partnering with an apparent Texas millionaire that the Kingpin thinks can be easily manipulated. However, the millionaire was actually bait planted by HYDRA. Learning of this from [[Nick Fury]], Daredevil spread the word through the underworld that the Kingpin had become a stooge of HYDRA, weakening his power. HYDRA steals the vast majority of his assets, bombs his businesses across New York City, and sends a helicopter gunship to attack his skyscraper offices. With his empire crumbling, the Kingpin is indicted on federal charges, and Daredevil tricks him into committing assault and battery at Manhattan's [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]]. Bailed out of jail by a rival who intends to use him as an errand boy, Fisk loses what remains of his sanity, murders his rival, and becomes a fugitive.<ref>''Daredevil'' #297-300. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fisk spends time in Japan rebuilding his empire and fighting the [[X-Men]]<ref>''X-Men'' #64 (May 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref> before returning to New York.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

===2000s===
While in Japan, he manipulates Maya Lopez ([[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]]) into thinking that Daredevil killed the woman's father (although Fisk was actually responsible) in order to incite Daredevil's death.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #10 (May 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, his plan backfires when Daredevil convinces Maya of the truth, and Lopez shoots the Kingpin in the eyes in retaliation, rendering him blind.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #15 (April 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> Fisk eventually loses his criminal empire to [[Samuel Silke]] (one of his employees who works with Richard) in a bloody assassination bid, using the Kingpin's new status as a blind man to rally supporters.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the aftermath, Vanessa kills Richard and flees the country with Fisk's remaining wealth while the Kingpin recuperates in an unnamed East European country, broken and alone. He is given an eye transplant which restores his eyesight.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #46. Marvel Comics.</ref> He eventually confronts Silke and fatally crushes the man's head, almost manages to regain his empire through sheer will, but is defeated by Daredevil (who declares himself the new Kingpin). Fisk is imprisoned as a result.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #50 (October 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

He later hatches a scheme to be freed and regain his wealth by giving the FBI proof in the form of the nonexistent "Murdock Papers" that Murdock is Daredevil. Having made so many enemies in prison, Fisk is constantly under attack from the Hand, HYDRA, and any number of criminal organizations with which he had had dealings. The U.S. government is hard-pressed to get rid of this expensive, dangerous, legally clean master criminal, and Fisk succeeds in manipulating the FBI into gravely wounding Daredevil and providing them a sample of Daredevil's DNA.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} He tells Ben Urich to give the federal government the location of the [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]], the only medic for injured superheroes, or go to jail.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #79 (January 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kingpin finally succeeds in getting Matt Murdock arrested, but the FBI betrays him at the last minute and arrests him as well, placing him in the same jail as Murdock in the hopes that the two will kill each other.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Instead, the two enemies team up in order to survive a prison riot directed at them. Finally, Murdock sacrifices the deal, refusing to let Bullseye (who was also incarcerated) leave the prison as the Kingpin had planned. The fight ends with the Kingpin shot point-blank in the knee by gunfire from Bullseye intended for Murdock, while Murdock escapes.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #86-87 (August - September 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fisk appears in the 2006 ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]: War Crimes'' one-shot issue, in which he offers information about [[Captain America]]'s Resistance base to [[Iron Man]], the leader of the [[2006 Superhuman Registration Act|pro-Registration]] forces in exchange for a reduced sentence. But as his status in prison is threatened for collaborating with Iron Man, he betrays Iron Man.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} He then puts out a hit on Spider-Man's loved ones after Iron Man convinced Peter Parker to publicly reveal himself as a means of demonstrating support for the Superhuman Registration Act. This results in [[Aunt May|May Parker]] being gravely wounded by a sniper's attempt to kill Spider-Man. After tracing the event back to Kingpin, Spider-Man confronts the Kingpin in prison and badly beats him in front of his fellow inmates. Spider-Man decides to let the Kingpin live with the humiliation of his defeat, news of which will quickly spread through the Underworld. Parker vows, however, to kill the Kingpin if May dies.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #538-542 (May–August 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Murdock returns to the United States with a cleared name and completes Vanessa's last wish and takes on Fisk's case, getting all charges dropped in exchange for Fisk leaving the country, giving up his American citizenship and his agreement to end his vendetta with Daredevil. Although the charges were dropped due to the evidence being deemed inadmissible in court, Murdock delays the case enough so Fisk is unable to attend his wife's funeral. The mournful Fisk is later seen visiting his wife's grave, before temporarily returning to New York to resolve some loose ends.<ref name=deadendkids>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #25-30. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a 2007-2008 storyline in the series ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'', Fisk meets with the Runaways, revealing he knew all about their [[Pride (comics)|parents]] since they ruled [[Los Angeles]] with efficiency and vision; he never tried to take their territory, nor did they invade his. He makes a deal with the Runaways to secure a mysterious object for him in exchange for protection from the government. He and his army of ninjas are defeated when the Runaways refuse to give it to him after stealing the object, discovering what Fisk wanted was a device invented by the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]. It is later revealed that Fisk was hired by elderly woman Lillie McGurty who orchestrated the events so the Runaways can travel back to 1907 and ensure that the woman would come back to the present with them, which her past self declined.<ref name=deadendkids/>

In the 2007 "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]" storyline, which ends with the undoing from history of Peter and [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s marriage and Spider-Man's real identity public revelation, all memories on the part of the public that Spider-Man is Peter is removed, including the Kingpin's.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}

During the 2008 "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, the Kingpin forms an alliance with [[Lady Bullseye]] to destroy Daredevil. He orders Lady Bullseye to disguise herself as a member of the Hand and kill two corrupt cops and a judge, making it seems that Daredevil ordered this and prompting [[Norman Osborn]] as the leader of the law enforcement organization [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] to send Bullseye in retaliation. Though Daredevil survives the fight with Bullseye, the Kingpin is undeterred and states that he has Daredevil "where he wants [his nemesis]".<ref>''Dark Reign: The List - Daredevil'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Kingpin has also targeted Daredevil's friends to frame Osborn for their recent misfortunes to further his attempts on manipulating Daredevil's actions. He has Nelson disbarred as an attorney for standing up to a judge on his payroll for an unfair ruling of overturning a jury's verdict. He also causes the loss of [[Dakota North (comics)|Dakota North]]'s private investigator license.<ref>''Daredevil''#502-504. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 2009 ''Daredevil'' arc "[[Return of the King (comics)|Return of the King]]", it is revealed that the Kingpin has spent the past year living a normal life in a small Spanish fishing village. There he meets and falls in love with Marta, a young mother of two. He finds himself trying to overcome his former life as a crimelord, only to later find Marta and the two kids murdered by Lady Bullseye and the Hand who then brutally attack him, stabbing him through the shoulders with two katanas. When he asks why, Lady Bullseye replies, "The reasons are far too numerous, but if you want a specific cause, ask Daredevil."<ref>''Daredevil'' #116. Marvel Comics.</ref> In his revenge against the Hand, the Kingpin frees and recruits the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] to help him. Fisk begins experiencing hallucinations of his dead wife who taunts him. It turns out that Fisk's actual plan is to take the leadership of the Hand, after killing Hiroshi, the ninja-lord who ordered the family's assassinations. However, he is thwarted by Daredevil who takes the lead for himself.<ref>''Daredevil'' #118-119 and #500. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2010s===
During the 2010 "[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]" storyline, the Kingpin approaches [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Luke Cage]], telling the two that they will need to take down Daredevil soon. The Kingpin and Lady Bullseye later perform a ritual that brings back [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] to attack the Hand.<ref>''Shadowland'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Daredevil is dethroned from Shadowland, the Kingpin takes both Shadowland and the Hand under his rule, officially taking his place back as the crimelord of New York City.<ref>''Shadowland'' #5.

During the 2011 "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline, it is revealed that Fisk has gained spider-powers, as demonstrated by heightened reflexes and the ability to crawl on walls.<ref>''Spider-Island: The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Like all other New Yorkers, he lost those powers when the situation was resolved.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #672 (October 26, 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the 2012 ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' initiative, the Kingpin hears about how [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] as the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] has been using brutal methods to take down the local crime families, which would leave a vacuum to fill. The Kingpin's Shadowland hideout is attacked by the Superior Spider-Man to which the Kingpin claims that the Superior Spider-Man is much different than the nemesis he had fought. While escaping, the Kingpin kills his [[doppelgänger]] Smedley Kornfeld (who was hired for events like this) in order to fool the Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

With his power over New York gone, Fisk set up shop in San Francisco, with the intention of rebuilding his empire there. But the vigilante [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] acted first, taking control of the local gangs and kidnapped the Owl who also relocated to San Francisco. He transformed Owlsley into a super-computer capable of taking control of all wifi signals in order to locate his former girlfriend [[Julia Carpenter]]. During this time, Daredevil confirmed his secret identity, taking a positive approach to it this time and moved to San Francisco to practice law and continue his superhero career. Fisk began to make moves against both of his enemies, hiring the assassin Ikari to kidnap Foggy and Matt's new girlfriend, Kirsten McDuffie, and having his men look for Julia to have leverage against the Shroud. However, the Shroud and Daredevil came into conflict when he and Jubua Pride, the Owl's daughter, attempted to free Owlsley. The Shroud then released all private information about Daredevil's law practice's clients. Daredevil went to Fisk and offered him a deal, he would use his resources to fix his situation and assure Foggy and Kirsten are safe, and in exchange Matt Murdock would fake his death and get a new identity only Fisk would know, giving Kingpin back the power to destroy Daredevil, which he lost when he went public. However, Fisk went with his original plan instead and Ikari kidnapped Nelson and Kirsten. Meanwhile, the Shroud, Pride, and Daredevil crashed when they attempted to get Julia at an airport, allowing Kingpin's goons to take her. Fisk presented his hostages when Daredevil confronted him and had him fight Ikari to the death, with Fisk killing one of them if Daredevil wins. The fight took them to the streets, where the Shroud saved Daredevil and killed Ikari. Improvising, Daredevil took Ikari's costume and claimed to have killed the hero while the Shroud had the Owl bring to light all of Fisk's operations in exchange for his freedom. While Kingpin and Daredevil fought, the federals stormed his building. Daredevil beat down the Kingpin when he tried to flee and rescued the hostages, leaving him in bankruptcy.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 4 #15-18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, the Kingpin hosts a viewing party for the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610 where his guests include [[Absorbing Man]], Bullseye, Norman Osborn, [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]].

Marvel Comics.</ref>

After HYDRA's defeat, Wilson Fisk is able to use a subsequent mayoral election to put himself forward as a last-minute candidate, avoiding his criminal past being drawn into the issue by simply ignoring questions about it, aided by the fact that he has never been legitimately charged with anything. With his primary policy being a bill to declare all vigilantes criminals, and despite Daredevil's own recent efforts to create a precedent for superheroes testifying under their secret identities in Washington, he is able to have Daredevil arrested in an FBI sting operation, mocking his old nemesis with the knowledge that the people he protects chose Fisk to 'protect' ''them'', prompting Daredevil to break a window and leap out of Fisk's office to begin his own efforts to bring down Fisk's empire. Matt Murdock then applied for the position of deputy mayor.<ref>''Daredevil'' #595.

==Skills, abilities and equipment==
[[File:Kingpincap.jpg|thumb|upright|The Kingpin fighting Captain America]]
While the Kingpin has no superhuman powers, he is incredibly strong and significantly more durable than the average human, possessing remarkable strength concealed by his extremely corpulent appearance. Most of his body mass is actually muscle that has been built to extraordinary size, much like a Super Heavyweight [[sumo|sumo wrestler]], or some [[Olympic weightlifting|Olympic weightlifters]] and [[Powerlifting|powerlifters]] but at greater strength levels. He has been shown to be strong enough to hurl large men across a room,{{Issue|date=November 2009}} rip limbs from people (demonstrated under a handshake),{{Issue|date=November 2009}} crush a man's skull with his bare hands,<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #10, Marvel Comics</ref> and leave imprints in concrete walls after punching them.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #69, Marvel Comics</ref> Defying his size, the Kingpin is a master of many forms of armed and unarmed combat, especially sumo wrestling. His signature move is the [[bear hug]]. He has fought [[Captain America]] to a standstill in hand-to-hand combat.<ref name="Captain America' 1972"/> His daily workout typically consists of simultaneously overcoming five or more trained martial artists with his bare hands;<ref>''Daredevil'' #170, Marvel Comics</ref> he stores his valuables in a safe which has no lock, only a door which is so heavy that only the Kingpin himself is strong enough to open it.<ref>''Daredevil'' #171, Marvel Comics</ref>

He typically wears [[Kevlar]] armor under his clothing. Fisk sometimes carries an "obliterator cane", a walking stick that conceals a laser weapon that can vaporize a handgun or a person's head at close range. He typically wears an ornamental diamond stick-pin that conceals compressed sleeping gas that is effective if sprayed into a victim's face. Due to his wealth and intellectual industry, Kingpin could use far more advanced paraphernalia, but he prefers to use such things as a last resort. As Fisk became less Spider-Man's enemy and more Daredevil's, he became more of a [[realism (arts)|naturalistic]] [[Mafia|mafioso]] than a comic book criminal mastermind, and depended less on [[science fiction]]-like weaponry.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The United States government is aware of the Kingpin's crimes but has never been able to prove his involvement. Members of the government have worked with him when necessary (even while describing him as "the devil"), such as when they needed his help to dispose of a Manhattan office building that the [[Beyonder]] turned into gold.<ref>"Gold Rush!", ''Web of Spider-Man'' #6 (September 1985); "This Gold Is Mine!", ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #268 (September 1985), Marvel Comics</ref> The Kingpin's willpower is so great that he can resist even the [[Purple Man]]'s mind control.<ref>"Pawns of the Purple Man!" ''Marvel Team-Up Annual'' #4 1981</ref> He is intellectually formidable and is a master tactician and a highly skilled planner and organizer. He is self-educated to university graduate level in the field of [[political science]]. He is extremely skilled and knowledgeable in the organization and management of criminal and legal business operations.

He is a highly formidable hand-to-hand combatant, cunning and utterly ruthless. This version of Fisk is also married to Vanessa and has a son, Richard, who is depicted as a young child.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}
*In the one-shot issue ''[[Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe]]'', the Punisher goes after the Kingpin after [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]] uses his hacking skills to destroy the Kingpin's empire. Kingpin informs the Punisher that he supported the latter's campaign to kill all of the superpowered beings, and has acquired an armory of weapons for the Punisher's use. As the Punisher attempts to shoot the Kingpin with a [[M16 rifle|M16]], the Kingpin grabs the rifle and destroys it with his bare hands. The Punisher responds by shooting two [[Desert Eagle]] pistols at the Kingpin, which only infuriates him. The Punisher kills the Kingpin by shooting him in the throat, and his body collapses on top of Castle, where he is found and arrested by [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officers. The Punisher's benefactor breaks him out of prison, whereupon Castle reveals he killed the Kingpin in order to acquire his high-tech weaponry, specifically a holographic scrambler, which Castle uses to disguise a helicopter as the [[Fantastic Four]]'s Fantasti-car, so he can infiltrate [[Latveria]] to kill [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Punisher Kills The Marvel Universe'' (November 1995).

*Fisk appears in a vegetative state in the first part of ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]''.<ref>''Spider-Man: Reign'' #1 (December 2006). Marvel Comics</ref>
*Fisk has appeared in different "[[What If (comics)|What If]]" stories:
**In ''What If the Punisher had Killed Daredevil?'', the Punisher hunts down the Kingpin, who has bribed the newly elected Mayor of New York City into working for him. Since the Punisher had used up the last of his ammo to kill [[Spider-Man]] (as his alter ego Peter Parker), the wounded Punisher attacks the Kingpin with a knife, only for the Kingpin to knock the knife out of his hand, and kill him by crushing the Punisher's throat with his bare hands. However, Castle had a back-up plan: he left a bomb outside the Kingpin's office, which goes off, killing the Kingpin and the Mayor.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #26 (June 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>
**In ''What If Venom had Possessed the Punisher?'', the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote possessed Frank Castle, who used Venom's powers to murder criminals, which had the side effect of merging their personalities.

As it turned out, Ra's gave Vanessa her cancer to force Kingpin to aid him, but the Kingpin actually formed an alliance with Batman and Spider-Man to save the city. Ra's attempted to get his revenge by denying Fisk the cure for Vanessa's cancer, but [[Talia al Ghul]], Ra's' daughter, provided the cure herself, recognizing in Vanessa a kindred spirit, as both of them loved men that society regarded as monsters.
* In the ''[[Batman/Daredevil: King of New York]]'' crossover, Kingpin almost loses his entire criminal empire to the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], who tries to dismantle it merely as a distraction so that he could spread his [[Scarecrow (DC comics)#Powers and abilities|fear toxin]] throughout New York.

When he attempts to run the experiment again (risking New York City's destruction), he is stopped by alternate versions of the wall-crawler and the new [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]]. After the battle, Kingpin and those involved are arrested by the police as Jefferson Davis finds him webbed up.

Thus, Kingpin is one of Spider-Man's oldest foes and the two have fought several times over the last eight years, but Spider-Man and the police were never able to gain the evidence necessary to expose Fisk as a criminal and arrest him. Like in the comics, Kingpin is portrayed as being a powerful fighter, just as good as he is a criminal mastermind, and, according to [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]], he easily defeated Spider-Man during their very first confrontation, slashing him with a [[katana]] from his artifacts collection. In the very first mission of the game, Spider-Man takes part in a police operation to arrest Fisk, as they finally gained enough evidence to expose him for the criminal he truly is. Breaking into Fisk Industries, Spider-Man battles numerous of Kingpin's goons and stops them from erasing crucial incriminatory evidence, before confronting Fisk in his office. After Spider-Man destroys his last line of defense, Kingpin battles the web-slinger himself, destroying several floors in the process, but Spider-Man eventually defeats Fisk and webs him up to the ceiling, just as the police break into the building. Kingpin is subsequently arrested and imprisoned in the Raft, a maximum security prison designed especially for supervillains, but, before he is taken away, Fisk angrily declares that Spider-Man will regret putting him away, as he was the only one keeping the city's gangs under control. This soon proves to be true, as crime rates quickly skyrockets after Kingpin's downfall and the Inner Demons, led by [[Mister Negative]], begin to seize his territories, sparking a gang war. Despite being locked up, Fisk continues to maintain a number of fronts throughout the city, allowing him to continue earning money to finance his criminal empire; Spider-Man helps the police find and dismantle these operations, leading Fisk to swear revenge on the hero. Kingpin is also mentioned in at least three side missions, with one involving Spider-Man thwarting his scheme to steal citizens' personal information for profit and the other two involving plans by Fisk's men to break him out of prison and/or destroy the evidence against him. Hitmen employed by Fisk will occasionally attack Spider-Man while he is travelling through the city.
* There are two playable versions of Kingpin ("Wilson Fisk" and "Spider-Verse") in the match-three mobile game ''[[Marvel Puzzle Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dinh |first=Christine |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/this-week-in-marvel-games-your-favorite-marvel-games-swing-into-the-spider-verse|title=This Week in Marvel Games: Your Favorite Marvel Games Swing Into the Spider-Verse|publisher=[[Marvel.com]]|date=December 13, 2018|accessdate=March 8, 2019}}</ref>
