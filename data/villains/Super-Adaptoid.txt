==Fictional character biography==

===Original version===
The original model (simply known as the Adaptoid) debuted in the ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' title, being created by scientific organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] (Advanced Idea Mechanics). An [[android (robot)|android]] containing a [[sherd|shard]] of the [[Cosmic Cube]] [[Magic item|artifact]], the Adaptoid is programmed to defeat the hero [[Captain America]], infiltrating the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' [[Avengers Mansion|Headquarters]] while impersonating various characters (such as [[Edwin Jarvis]] and [[Bucky Barnes]]), and then copies the standout fighting abilities and respective traits of several Avengers ([[Hank Pym|Goliath]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]) as the "Super-Adaptoid". After a long battle, the android flees after incorrectly believing that Captain America had been killed.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #82 - 84 (October - December 1966)</ref>

The Super-Adaptoid then took refuge underground near the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute For Higher Learning]] and was unintentionally awakened by an optic blast from [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]]. The Adaptoid left his hideout and saw the [[X-Men]] in their civilian clothes ice skating. He then recalls that he had another mission: to transform others into Adaptoids like himself, so he begins his attempt with the [[X-Men]]. They refused and a fight broke out. As the battle dragged on, [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] (having just been asked to leave the X-Men) watched from a distance and saw how powerful the Adaptoid was. The Adaptoid soon defeated the X-Men, and was then approached by Mimic offered to become an Adaptoid. During the process, Mimic had a change of heart when learning of having no free will and the two began to fight. During the battle, the Adaptoid tried to copy the powers that Mimic had copied from the X-Men and failed. Mimic then devised a plan and tried to mimic the Adaptoid's abilities, causing huge feedback which made both of them lose their powers. As Mimic was rescued by his fellow X-Men, the Adaptoid fell to a river below.<ref>''X-Men'' #29 (February 1967)</ref>

The Super-Adaptoid later attacks Captain America during a charity event involving the Avengers, after copying the abilities/powers of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Iron Man]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. He is tricked into using all his powers at once, overloading himself.<ref>''Avengers'' #45 (October 1967)</ref> The Adaptoid was featured in the ''Iron Man'' title reactivated by Jarr and Tyrr as a servant. After a battle where Iron Man defeated the Adaptoid, the android evolved into the metal-based '''Cyborg-Sinister''', attacking [[Stark Industries]] which resulted in another confrontation with Iron Man which ended with the android being seemingly destroyed.<ref>''Iron Man'' #49 - 51 (August - October 1972)</ref> The Adaptoid reforms in the ''Captain Marvel'' title, and after a brief battle with Iron Man follows the hero to Avengers Mansion, where the character battles the team and [[Kree]] ally Captain Marvel. [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]] tricks the Adaptoid into copying nega-bands, which act as a portal to the alternate [[Negative Zone]] dimension. By striking the Adaptoid's nega-bands together, Mar-Vell banishes the character to the Negative Zone indefinitely.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #50 (June 1977)</ref>

The Super-Adaptoid is retrieved in the ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' title, and used unsuccessfully by villains [[Annihilus]] and [[Blastaar]] against the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the Avengers in the Negative Zone.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #75 (May 1981)</ref> The Adaptoid reappears in the ''Avengers'' title. Revealed to be stored at Avengers Mansion, the android is found by the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] when a [[Masters of Evil|group of supervillains]] storm Avengers Mansion, overpowering and changing places with Fixer. The Adaptoid disguises himself as Fixer while the real Fixer was in the android's former confinement tube at [[Hydro-Base|Avengers Island]].<ref>''Avengers'' #277 (March 1987)</ref> The Adaptoid then replicates [[Mentallo]]'s powers. Uniting a [[Heavy Metal (Marvel Comics)|team of artificial beings]] ([[Awesome Android]], [[Machine Man]], [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry 459]] and [[TESS-One]]), the Adaptoid directs them against the Avengers. While the heroes are distracted, the Adaptoid summons the entity [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]] to Earth, so that the character can copy the sentient's powers and become the all-powerful '''Supreme Adaptoid''' that can now reproduce itself. Although successful, the android is ultimately tricked into shutting down by Captain America and its Cosmic Cube shard is removed by Kubik.<ref>''Avengers'' #286 - 290 (December 1987 - April 1988)</ref>

The Super-Adaptoid makes a brief appearance during the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'' storyline having a confrontation with the [[Fantastic Four]] ([[Mister Fantastic]], [[Invisible Woman]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]),<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #336 (January 1990)</ref> and in the ''Heroes for Hire'' title where the android has an encounter with the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] (aka the disguised [[Masters of Evil]] consisting of [[Helmut Zemo]], [[Abner Jenkins|Mach-I]], [[Erik Josten|Atlas]], [[Karla Sofen]], Techno and [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]]) and the [[Heroes for Hire]],<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #7 & 10 (January & April 1998)</ref> and the ''Hulk'' title where scientist [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] is [[blackmail]]ed into being involved with the Adaptoid's repair and activation.<ref>''Hulk'' #469 (October 1998)</ref>

The android poses as "'''Alessandro Brannex'''" during various titles. With [[MODAM]] as an enforcer, Alessandro was the C.E.O. of the terrorist organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] on the Boca Caliente island country.<ref>''Quasar'' #9 (April 1990)</ref> While making A.I.M. into a public friendly company, Brannex tries to personally show Captain America of this legal change,<ref>''Captain America'' #387 (July 1991)</ref> and tries to get rid of Iron Man to finish a potential nuclear weapons deal.<ref>''Iron Man'' #296 - 297 (September - October 1993)</ref> His impersonation is revealed during [[Superia]]'s assassination to which the Adaptoid regenerated itself.<ref>''Captain America'' #412 - 413 (February - March 1993)</ref> On the Adaptoid-inhabited Boca Caliente, Alessandro's A.I.M. fraction is behind [[MODOK]]'s resurrection. The Adaptoid personally reveals itself during a confrontation with the [[Red Skull]] but is caught in the recreated Cosmic Cube's reality-warping ability and is presumed destroyed.<ref name="Ca440-441">''Captain America'' #440 - 441 (June - July 1995)</ref><ref name="Av387-388">''Avengers'' #387 - 388 (June - July 1995)</ref>

The Super-Adaptoid appears in the limited series ''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar'', and is revealed to be a warrior in the employ of the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien race]] under [[Ultron]]'s control. Claiming he left Earth after becoming disgusted with humanity's chaotic nature, the Adaptoid attempts to destroy [[Phyla-Vell]], [[Moondragon]] and [[Adam Warlock]].<ref>''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar'' #1 - 4 (July - October 2007)</ref>

===Other models===
Another model was provided as a field agent of a [[New Enforcers|villainous group]] against [[Spider-Man]]. This Adaptoid is ultimately used by crime boss [[Richard Fisk|Blood Rose]] intentionally to affect the other mechanical teammates.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #99 - 100 (April – May 1993)</ref>
{{-}}

'''Batch 13''' was an Adaptoid in A.I.M.'s possession. Breaking out of its containment unit and escaping to [[New York City]], it copied the various powers/abilities of Captain America and the [[Fantastic Force]]. As it was imitating powers, Batch 13 began to have a psychic breakdown after copying Psi-Lord's psycho armor. As a result, Huntara conjured up a portal to send Batch 13 into.<ref>''Fantastic Force'' #4 (February 1995)</ref>
{{-}}

Several Adaptoids can be seen on Boca Caliente, fooling several Avengers ([[Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff)|Black Widow]] and Hercules). During the Cosmic Cube recreation, an Adaptoid (having been impressed by Captain America's heroic nature) ended the threat by willingly transforming itself into a non-sentient containment chamber for the reality-warping energies.<ref name="Ca440-441" /><ref name="Av387-388" /> 
{{-}}

An '''Ultra-Adaptoid''' appears in the limited series ''Super-Villain Team-Up: Modok's 11''. Created by A.I.M. to infiltrate [[MODOK]]'s group of supervillains, the character has no independent will and is remotely controlled. Courtesy of a [[satellite]] relay, the Adaptoid has access to dozens of powers, but is eventually destroyed when released from A.I.M. control.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's Eleven'' #1 - 4 (September - December 2008)</ref>

Adaptoids from an alternate reality are used by the [[Andrew Forson|Scientist Supreme]] to combat the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #25 - 28 (January - April 2014)</ref>

===Other identity users===
The terrorist organization [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] have [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]] as a Super-Adaptoid to battle the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. A fusion of human and machine, she managed to copy the New Avengers' various powers. She is eventually defeated when the powers "copied" from the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] cause her the same [[psychological]] problems. HYDRA then destroys her via a remote-controlled self-destruct device.<ref name="NAA1">''New Avengers Annual'' #1 (June 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Norman Osborn]] is given the Super-Adaptoid abilities by his [[H.A.M.M.E.R.|followers]] to replace his lack of the [[Iron Patriot]] armor and his disinclination to return to his old [[Green Goblin]] role, absorbing the powers of the Avengers, the New Avengers, and his [[Dark Avengers|personal group]]. He's defeated when the Avengers and the New Avengers struck him all at once, the multiple powers working against each other and causing him to collapse into a coma.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #24 (May 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The original iteration is an artificial construct created by A.I.M. capable of copying or mimicking the powers and skills of numerous super beings, including specific equipment (e.g. [[Captain America]]'s [[Captain America's shield|shield]], [[Iron Man]]'s [[Iron Man's armor|armor]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]'s bow and arrows, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]) and clothing. This ability to adapt was originally courtesy of a shard of the [[Cosmic Cube]] artifact, although the shard was eventually removed by [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]]. The character, however, has proven capable of continuing to function without the shard. The Super-Adaptoid possesses exceptional artificial intelligence, but limited imagination and an inability to understand the human condition has led to defeat in the past.<ref>''Avengers'' #290 (April 1988)</ref> The Super-Adaptoid's abilities had duplicated/mimicked Alessandro Brannex, [[Abner Jenkins]], [[Agent Axis (Marvel Comics)|Agent Axis]], [[Scott Lang|Ant-Man]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], [[Bucky Barnes]], Captain America, [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie Lang]], [[Doctor Druid]], [[Edwin Jarvis]], [[Erik Josten]], [[Fang (comics)|Fang]], [[Hank Pym]], Hawkeye, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], [[Helmut Zemo]], [[Human Torch]], [[Invisible Woman]], Iron Man, [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Karla Sofen]], Kubik, [[Luke Cage]], [[Machine Man]], [[Mentallo]], [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]], [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Monica Rambeau]], [[Fixer (comics)|Paul Norbert Ebersol]], [[Phyla-Vell]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Red Skull]]'s battle suit, [[Scarlet Witch]], [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], Thor, [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. The Cyborg-Sinister is equipped with an axe esque scythe. The Supreme Adaptoid has the power to mass-produce billions of itself in order to replicate/replace [[Homo sapiens|human beings]].

The other versions demonstrate similar mimicking/duplicating abilities of [[Blitz (Marvel Comics)|Blitz]], Bucky Barnes, [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]], Devlor, [[Dragon Man]], [[Dreadnought (comics)|Dreadnought]], [[Eel (comics)|Eel]], Fixer, [[Franklin Richards (comics)|Franklin Richards]], [[Free Spirit (comics)|Free Spirit]], Huntara, [[Jack Flag]], [[Sunset Bain|Madame Menace]], Mentallo, [[Mister Fear]], [[Plantman]], [[Red Guardian]], [[Richard Fisk]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Thermite (comics)|Thermite]], [[Tangle (comics)|Tangle]], [[Vanisher]] and Vibraxas.

[[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]]'s Super-Adaptoid powers manages to copy the abilities of [[Carol Danvers]], Iron Man, Luke Cage, [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], Spider-Man, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Veranke]]. Spider-Man had the idea to overload her ability to duplicate powers by having everyone attack all at once, overloading Yelena's Adaptoid copying ability as she only had the 'space' to copy one at a time rather than all of them.<ref name="NAA1" />

[[Norman Osborn]]'s Super-Adaptoid abilities copy the powers of Ai Apaec, [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]], [[June Covington]], Luke Cage, [[Noh-Varr|Protector]], [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], [[Skaar (comics)|Skaar]], [[Superia]], [[Barney Barton|Trickshot]] and Vision. A similar solution is used to defeat him when all of the Avengers and the New Avengers, overloading Osborn's system and causing him to become comatose as his body couldn't cope with so many different powers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #23 (April 2012)</ref>

==Other versions==

===2099===
The Super-Adaptoid has been inert dating back to the Age of Heroes and is the subject of worship by a [[cargo cult]] uncovered by the [[Spider-Man 2099|Spider-Man]] of [[Marvel 2099|2099]]. Upon sighting Spider-Man, the machine (not recognizing this new hero) turns into the closest approximation (a combination of the original Spider-Man and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]) that it can based on appearance, turning into [[Flipside (comics)|Flipside]].<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #29 - 30 (March - April 1995)</ref>

===Heroes Reborn===
The Super-Adaptoid appeared in Franklin Richards's [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]] universe as a device used by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] but is defeated by the Avengers. Since its defeat, it gains [[sentience]] as '''Amazo-Maxi-Woman''', joining the heroes' quest to stop [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 2 #11 (September 1997)</ref>

===Spider-Gwen===
In ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' which takes place on Earth-65, Super-Adaptoid is known as '''Project Green''' and is a member of the S.I.L.K. organization.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' Vol. 2 #7 (June 2016)</ref>
