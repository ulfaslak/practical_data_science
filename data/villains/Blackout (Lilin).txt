Blackout first appeared in ''[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]'' #2 and was created by [[Howard Mackie]] and Javier Saltares.

==Fictional character biography==
===Battling Ghost Rider===
Blackout was a darkness-generating superhuman and professional criminal who first appeared in ''[[Ghost Rider (comic book)|Ghost Rider]]'' #2 (1990). He has the ability to automatically generate a light-dampening field which negates all visible light in a significant area. His albinoesque complexion and extreme physical sensitivity to sunlight and light in general likely accounts for this power manifestation, and its vampiric similarities apparently led him to have his teeth and fingernails replaced with mechanically-enhanced metal ones.

Blackout was initially employed by the demonic crime lord [[Deathwatch (comics)|Deathwatch]] as an enforcer and assassin. Deathwatch ordered Blackout to search for bio-toxin canisters stolen by a youth gang named the Cypress Hill Jokers under their leader Paulie Stratton. Blackout murdered detective Frank Loretti and his family as well as Ralph D'Amato's parents before battling the Ghost Rider ([[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Dan Ketch]]) for the first time.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #2</ref> Deathwatch and Blackout then attacked the [[New York Police Department|NYPD]]'s 75th Precinct police station, murdered several police officers, stole the bio-toxin canisters, and abducted Paulie and the Cypress Hill Jokers. Subsequently, Blackout battled the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s men as well as Ghost Rider again. Blackout was disfigured in the battle when he was scorched by hellfire by trying to bite through Ghost Rider's jacket. This caused him to become Ghost Rider's sworn arch-enemy.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #3</ref> Blackout learned Ghost Rider's identity as Dan Ketch, and murdered his comatose sister Barbara Ketch in revenge.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #7</ref> Blackout then killed Ketch's acquaintances, newspaper vendor Theodore Larsen and Father Michael McDonald.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #8</ref>

Blackout continued to stalk Ghost Rider. He encountered [[HEART (comics)|HEART]], and menaced some human children protected by the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] [[Pixie (Morlock)|Pixie]] (not to be confused with the [[Pixie (X-Men)|X-Men character of the same name]]), who had been in conflict with [[Masque (comics)|Masque]] over a plan to change babies into mutated forms. Ghost Rider's incorrect belief it was Blackout behind the vanishing of babies brings the attention of the real Blackout. Though the children are rescued safely, with the assistance of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], Blackout manages to kill Pixie and escape after battling Ghost Rider again.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #9 (Jan. 1991)</ref>

Blackout murdered several sewer workers, then battled Ghost Rider, [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]] and HEART again; during this battle, his face is further disfigured by Blaze's gun, and Blackout was finally captured by the police.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #14-15</ref> He was freed from prison by the [[Firm (comics)|Firm]], then abducted Ketch's mother and friends, seemingly murdering Dan Ketch by tearing his throat out while he is in human form. Only supernatural intervention from other sources allows Dan to recover while the Ghost Rider exists as a separate entity. Around this time, Blackout went on a murderous rampage through [[Central Park]], leading to a hostage situation with the police. Along with Mr. Stern, Blackout is captured by Ghost Rider and sealed in a [[mausoleum]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #25</ref>

With Mr. Stern, Blackout escapes the mausoleum. Blackout experiences a vision of [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Mother of All Demons|Lilith]], the demon-goddess who claimed she was his grandmother.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #28</ref> Blackout joins forces with Lilith and the Lilin, and would team up with many superpowered offspring of Lilith, all doing her will. Blackout, [[Creed (comics)|Creed]], and [[Pilgrim (comics)|Pilgrim]] abducted John Blaze's son, then battles Blaze and Ghost Rider.<ref>''Spirits of Vengeance'' #1</ref> Alongside Lilth and the Lilin, Blackout battles Ghost Rider, John Blaze, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Dr. Michael Morbius]], the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]], and the [[Darkhold|Darkhold Redeemers]] in [[Greenland]]. [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] impales Blackout through the eye, killing him.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #31</ref> Blackout is later reborn along with the rest of his fallen brethren, thanks to Lilith. He has a fresh new face, but it is later burned in battle with Ghost Rider.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #41 (1993)</ref>

During one of his many times working with Lilith, he re-inspires the police officer Badilino into becoming [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]] again. Wracked with doubt after learning his demonic mission means little, Badilino is frozen with indecision as Lilith's forces, Blackout, Dark Legion and Meatmarket attack his precinct. Seeing Blackout threaten to consume a small child, Badilino transforms and literally leaps into action. The child is saved. Blackout takes an opportunity minutes later to attack Dan Ketch's friend Stacy Dolan. She is saved by Ghost Rider. Blackout and the Lilin are distracted by the arrival of [[Doctor Strange]] and other [[Midnight Sons]], who are their primary objective. A spell, cast as the Sons retreat from overwhelming forces, protects the citizens in the precinct from being seen by Lilin.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #44 (1993)</ref>

After being defeated by the [[Midnight Sons]], Blackout had his face deformities repaired and went back to work as a hired assassin, also eliminating a few personal grudges along the way. He becomes romantically obsessed with Wei, a female reporter who has figured out Ghost Rider's secret identity. His murderous torment of Wei causes her to snap and commit suicide live on camera.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #54 (October 1994)</ref> He is captured by Ghost Rider and chained over the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] where he is thought to have burned to death.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #66 (October 1995)</ref>

===''New Avengers''===
Much later, Blackout was seen among the escaping villains in the prison breakout in ''New Avengers'' #1, and his sudden lack-of-death is later explained in the ''New Avengers: Most Wanted Files'', where it is revealed he was arrested before burning to death.

Blackout was hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the [[Registration Acts (comics)#Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #35</ref> He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #2 (2005)</ref>

===''Secret Invasion''===
In ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', he is one among many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref>

===Death of Caretaker===
Blackout is later seen aiding [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Danny Ketch]]'s attack and killing [[Caretaker (comics)|Caretaker]] before facing off against [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 6 #26-27</ref>

He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref> He was recruited by Zadikiel to assemble a "task-force" of Ghost Rider foes in order to hunt down and destroy both the Ketch & Blaze Ghost Riders.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 6 #33</ref> Later, he attacked the church filled with the gun armed [[nuns]], alongside [[Orb (comics)|Orb]], [[Deacon (comics)|Deacon]] and the new [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]]. He cloaks the place in darkness threatening and mocking the nuns, but is stopped by being shot with bullets that were covered in holy water. Blackout runs away screaming in pain into the night.<ref>'' Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire'' #1-5</ref>

===''Siege''===
Blackout was seen during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] as part of the Hood crime syndicate.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1 #608</ref>

===''Fear Itself''===
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Blackout and [[Deathwatch (comics)|Deathwatch]] assist [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] (in the form of Skadi) in attacking Dayton, Ohio. Since Johnny Blaze is no longer Ghost Rider, a man named Adam performs a ritual in a pyramid in Nicaragua in which one of his followers, a woman named Alejandra, becomes the new female Ghost Rider who is able to defeat Deathwatch and Blackout II.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 7 #1</ref>

He reappears as one of the villains summoned by Sin to battle Earth's heroes.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Fearless'' #10</ref>

===In ''The Superior Spider-Man''===
In an attempt to rebuild his reputation, Blackout goes after [[Superior Spider-Man]]. He kidnaps Peter Parker's [[Aunt May]], and holds her hostage, demanding that Parker, as Spider-Man's "tech designer", hand himself over in exchange. Superior Spider-Man tracks him down and they fight. Blackout gains the advantage and tries to bite out Spider-Man's neck. Unfortunately for Blackout, Spider-Man was wearing a metal neck cover under his costume, which electrocuted him. Spider-Man then tortured Blackout, ripping out his claws and teeth. In agony, Blackout begs for mercy, promising never to go after anyone Spider-Man knows again. Spider-Man tells him to spread the word to all the other criminals that "Peter Parker is off limits", then exposes Blackout to artificial sunlight, burning him.<ref>''Superor Spider-Man Annual'' #1 (2013)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Blackout is a half demon, giving him several superhuman abilities. His strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes are superhuman. He can see in near darkness, and he has the mystical ability to extinguish both natural and artificial light sources in his immediate vicinity. However, his skin is highly sensitive to light. He has enhanced teeth, jaws, and claws, which he usually employs to tear out the throats of his victims and enemies. He is a highly experienced hand-to-hand combatant, a superior acrobat, and wrestler.

==In other media==
===Film===
[[Johnny Whitworth]] has confirmed that his character '''Ray Carrigan''' in ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]'' was based on Marvel's half-demon Blackout. As stated by Whitworth he plays "the villain who, at the beginning, up until like page 70, is human, [...] I'm not a very nice guy. I'm bad. I get turned into, for those who read 'Ghost Rider', the character Blackout. I get turned into him by the devil to complete my job. That gives me the fortitude to fight Ghost Rider and the supernatural abilities to compete on some level with that guy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/128896-blackout-confirmed-for-ghost-rider-spirit-of-vengeance|title=Superherohype.com: Blackout Confirmed for 'Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance'}}</ref> The film creators have confirmed that the character will not follow the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] mythology of the character and admitted that they based his characterization on the look of the character alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/168750-ghost-rider-sequels-blackout-wont-follow-marvel-mythology|title=Ghost Rider Sequel's Blackout Won't Follow Marvel Mythology}}</ref> Ray Carrigan is a [[mercenary]], [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]], and [[gun runner]] who works for Roarke (the human form of the [[Mephisto (comics)|Devil]]). He and his men are hired by Roarke to kidnap Danny, the son of Nadya (a woman who once was an ex-girlfriend of Carrigan and was saved from the brink of death by Roarke). Even though Ray and his men succeeded in capturing Danny, they end up pursued by Nayda and Ghost Rider. After being badly injured during a fight with Ghost Rider at a quarry, Carrigan's body is found dying under some rubble by Roarke. To ensure that Carrigan finishes his job, Roarke uses his powers to heal Carrigan by transforming him into Blackout. A difference between the comics version is that this Blackout has powers over darkness and decay and not a vampire. Blackout's decay powers don't work on a [[Twinkie]] when every other food he tries to eat rapidly decays the moment he touches it. When Ghost Rider, Moreau, and Nadya bring Danny to a holy area where Danny would be protected, the monks there wanted to kill the boy to prevent the Devil from getting them only for Blackout to kill the monks and recapture Danny. During the fight with Roarke to rescue Danny, Moreau sacrifices himself to distract Blackout from attacking Johnny Blaze (who is then repowered by Danny). In the final fight with Ghost Rider on the road, Blackout is killed when Ghost Rider uses the Penance Stare on him and throws him off of Nadya's truck.

===Video games===
*Blackout appears in the ''[[Ghost Rider (video game)|Ghost Rider]]'' video game (based on the [[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|2007 film of the same name]]), voiced by [[Lex Lang]]. In the game, he steals a modified jet ski and uses it to escape a lab while being chased by Ghost Rider.
