==Fictional character biography==
Mariah Dillard was the leader of a gang of New York criminals called the Rat Pack. Their primary source of criminal activity was using a stolen ambulance to pick up the bodies of the recently deceased, and then stealing whatever valuables they had on their person.<ref>''Avengers Origins: Luke Cage'' #1</ref> During one of these thefts, a widow of one of the victims hired Power Man (who was at the scene of the murder) to find her husband's body. Power Man finds the hideout of Black Mariah.<ref>''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire'' #5</ref> This led to a clash between Mariah and her men against Power Man. Power Man defeated Mariah and her cohorts and turned them over to the police.<ref>Luke Cage, Hero for Hire #10</ref>

After some time in prison, Black Mariah started a drug-dealing enterprise. She is the primary distributor of a drug called Acid Z, a potent drug that would eventually make its users become crazy and often suicidal. When some of the drug got into the hands of Luke Cage's friend D.W. Griffith, Power Man went looking for his old friend while his partner [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] tracked down the primary distributor and shut them down. Iron Fist found Black Mariah's hideout; however, he also found out that she had hired a special enforcer as protection: Iron Fist's old foe [[Scimitar (Marvel Comics)|Scimitar]]. Power Man joined Iron Fist in battle after learning of his old foe's involvement in the drug distribution. The Heroes for Hire made short work of Mariah and Scimitar, crushing their drug operation and turning both crooks over to the police.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #88</ref>

Black Mariah is featured in the 2016 relaunch of ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/marvels-april-2016-solicitations-introduce-black-panther-gwenpool-more|title=Marvel's April 2016 Solicitations Introduce "Black Panther," "Gwenpool" & More|work=Comic Book Resources|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> Here, she teams up with former Heroes for Hire secretary [[Jennifer Royce|Jennifer "White Jennie" Royce]] into taking down [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]'s empire.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' vol. 3 #1</ref>
