==Fictional character biography==
Basil Sandhurst was born in [[Kittery Point, Maine]]. Sandhurst worked as an electro-mechanical/chemical research scientist. His obsession with control brought his downfall as a scientist when his refusal to obey ethical restraints got him banned from most research facilities. Sandhurst was prone to fits of rage and in an attempt to calm him, his brother Vincent inadvertently triggered a lab explosion, crippling Basil. Vincent, guilt-ridden, outfitted Basil with an automated lab in which Basil bonded a super-strong exoskeleton to his body, powered by the cerebral energies from those around him using his slave discs. As the Controller, he planned to invade and enslave New York City, but [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Jasper Sitwell]] foiled his scheme and left the Controller comatose.<ref>''Iron Man'' #13</ref> The Controller eventually came out of his coma and took over the Pinewood Sanitarium. He created an improved set of equipment but was again defeated by War Machine.<ref>''Iron Man'' #28</ref>

Months later, he was released from prison by the alien [[Thanos]], who upgraded his technology. Thanos promised the Controller rulership of Earth, and so he began enslaving dozens of operatives. He invaded [[Avengers Mansion]] and defeated the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]], and abducted Lou-Ann Savannah. The Controller's egotistical displays endangered Thanos's security, and when the Controller failed to defeat Thanos's enemy, Captain Marvel, the alien left him for dead.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #28, 30</ref> The Controller went underground for years, upgrading via Stark technology stolen from [[Justin Hammer]], and eventually enslaved a cult. He set the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]] against Iron Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. Iron Man defeated him and imprisoned him in a vat of experimental plastic, but he escaped. Alongside one of the Blood Brothers, he fought Iron Man, but Iron Man defeated him once more and he was confined to the prison for supervillains called the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #88-91</ref> He eventually broke out of jail, only to be defeated by Iron Man again. During the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]," the Controller escaped from the Vault and at the behest of the [[Red Skull]], he enslaved [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and set him against [[Captain America]]. He unsuccessfully attempted to control [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] at the behest of the Red Skull, and unsuccessfully attempted to aid the Red Skull against [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. He was ultimately defeated by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #365-367</ref>

Revived by the world-conquering [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]], the Controller became the Master's pawn against the Avengers and [[Heroes for Hire]]. Abandoned after a later defeat, the Controller, in an ironic nod to his many hospitalizations, acquired his own clinic, where he influenced the wealthy to do his bidding. However, the Controller could not resist enslaving [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] as well, leading to his latest defeat by Iron Man.

Returned to The Raft, the Controller escaped with dozens of others but was recaptured during a clash with the [[U-Foes]] and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name="Avengers.">{{

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Super-Human Registration Act. He appears as part of the Hood's alliance with super-powered heroes; the grouping is intent on defeating the Skrull invasion force of New York City.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #6</ref>

[[Maria Hill]] found the Controller holed up in the basement of a Futurepharm facility in Austin, Texas, while on orders from Tony Stark.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #11</ref> He had been abducting members of the local populace for months to bolster a new army and attempted to brainwash Hill as well. However, she resisted his efforts and freed his drones, sabotaging the entire operation.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #13</ref>

The Controller gave White Fang a new suit so that she could kill the Hood.<ref>''Dark Reign: The Hood'' #3</ref> 

The Controller later appears in [[Boston]], assembling major crime families in an Italian restaurant. When the Avengers invade the restaurant, the Controller uses his control discs on the criminals as well as [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] but he is defeated by [[Jane Foster (comics)|Thor]]. After the Avengers defeat the first wave of Leviathon monsters, the Controller tries to put a control disc on Thor but he is stopped by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>''The Avengers'' Vol. 7 #1.MU</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Controller designed his armored exoskeleton, which is micro-surgically attached to his body from head to toe and grants him mobility, as well as superhuman strength and endurance. He uses "slave discs" to control others, using the micro-circuitry in his helmet to drain cerebral energy from his victims to power his exoskeleton and magnify its strength and duplicate his victim's abilities. He has limited psychokinetic and telepathic abilities, the ability to control the actions of any one person wearing one of his slave discs, and the ability to fire mental bolts of force from his helmet. He can psionically control "weak-willed" subjects even without his discs. He flies via boot-jets and has employed image inducers, stun mists, and other technology as needed.<ref name="needed.">{{

The Controller originally used a mental wave absorbatron to convert cerebral energies for use by his exoskeleton, though this device was rendered obsolete after [[Thanos]] improved the Controller's equipment. The discs now increase his physical attributes in geometric progression to numbers of victims wearing slave discs, and he was able to control the actions of all persons wearing the discs.

The Controller is a highly skilled chemist and mechanical engineer, with a college degree in chemistry and electrical and mechanical engineering.

Agents on the inside of the Vault that freed Controller. Controller uses his new abilities which includes super-strength, flight, and forcefield abilities to attack Iron Man. Controller reveals that he had placed some probes in Iron Man which gave him some data on the Extremis serum in Iron Man. Upon a discovering a glitch, Iron Man discovers that Controller has placed Iron Man in his virtual reality, known as the Mainframe. Controller reveals that he had created the Mainframe to control the minds of everyone when Controller's control disks wouldn't work on Iron Man and states that he now knows Iron Man's true identity. Controller then plans to get Tony Stark's mind opened so that he can get more info on the Extremis serum. When Controller takes control of Iron Man's onboard computer, Iron Man uses his Extremis ability to hack into the Mainframe which harms everyone hooked up to it. Controller tries to use Mainframe clones of James Rhodes and Pepper Potts to get Iron Man to stop which fails. Iron Man manages to shut down the Mainframe as he wakes up in an A.I.M. base as does Controller. Controller then plans to get into Tony's mind and uses his Control Disk to control War Machine to attack Iron Man. War Machine manages fight the control disk enough to overload Controller's helmet.
