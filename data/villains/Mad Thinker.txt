The '''Mad Thinker''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is portrayed to be an evil genius specializing in [[robotics]]. He is sometimes referred to just as "The Thinker".

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
The Mad Thinker was introduced by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #15 (June 1963). Little to nothing was known of his origins or true identity until, over fifty years later, the Mad Thinker's first name was revealed to be '''Julius''' in the pages of Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev's ''Infamous Iron Man'' #2.<ref>As revealed in ''Infamous Iron Man'' #2</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The professional criminal mastermind known as the Mad Thinker made his debut fighting the Fantastic Four. He once attempted to take over New York City using the [[Baxter Building]] as his base and all organized crime members as his lieutenants. The Fantastic Four were lured away from New York just before a [[meteorite]] struck the city and briefly knocked out electrical power, including the Baxter Building's defense systems. The Mad Thinker took the opportunity to create a robotic servant, the [[Awesome Android]]. He trapped the Fantastic Four in the lower quarters of the building but was eventually caught, after being stopped by an unforeseen factor: the building's mailman, [[Willie Lumpkin]], who on Reed's orders rang a bell at 4 pm, activating a circuit breaker Reed had built into all his devices.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #15</ref>

It seemed that his primary objective had not really been to take over the city, but to manipulate organized crime into helping him get into the Baxter building so that he could indulge his intellectual avarice by stealing the technology of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]. In that sense, the Fantastic Four did not really defeat him, they only defeated his pretext. The Mad Thinker would gladly get sent to prison for a peek at the secrets of what he considered the greatest mind in the world.{{issue|date=May 2015}}

After his initial defeat against the Fantastic Four, the Mad Thinker teamed with the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] for the first time. He used the original [[X-Men]] through a mind-controlled [[Professor X]] to battle the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #28</ref> Again with the Puppet Master, he pitted the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] against the [[Human Torch]], but was foiled by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #126</ref> Later he created a radio-controlled [[bouncing ball]] with which he tried to eliminate the Thing and Torch while they were at a new dam's opening and nearly brought down the ball, but the Torch was able to destroy it.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

He then created [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]], a "living" computer. He located and revived the [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]] and used him to battle the present-day Torch.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #4</ref> Later, with his Triumvirate of Terror (consisting of Piledriver, Hammerhead, and Thunderboot), he captured the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and invaded [[Avengers Mansion]], believing that he had successfully overcome them by remembering to take advantage of the human element of his enemies' personalities that he had forgotten in the past, but he was nevertheless foiled by the unexpected intervention of [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], who had only recently begun to stay with the Avengers following his exile from Olympus.<ref>''Avengers'' #39</ref>

The Mad Thinker impersonated Dr. Jose Santini, and disrupted an attempt to cure the Thing, causing the Thing to turn against the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #68-69</ref> However, the Mad Thinker was captured by Mister Fantastic and the Human Torch. From his prison cell, he sent a battle android called the Monster Android against the Fantastic Four, but the android was sent into the [[Negative Zone]] by Mister Fantastic.<ref name="Fantastic Four #70-71">''Fantastic Four'' #70-71</ref>

He allied with the Puppet Master again and with [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] in their attempted blackmail of the United States government using a laser-firing satellite and a giant android called "Gargan-Droid".<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #14; ''Avengers'' #63; ''Captain Marvel'' #14</ref> Again with the Puppet Master, he attacked the Fantastic Four using androids of their past foes.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #100</ref> With the Puppet Master, he then battled [[Spider-Man]] and the Thing.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #6</ref>

The Mad Thinker then took part in the [[Black Lama]]'s contest of super-villains, but was defeated by [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #74-75, 77</ref> Mad Thinker then re-established control of his robot the Scavenger and sent it against the Fantastic Four. He was defeated by [[Thundra]], [[Tigra]], and [[Brute (Reed Richards)|Brute]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #181-183</ref> He then battled the Thing, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #37-39</ref> With the Puppet Master and [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], he attempted to disrupt the wedding of the Human Torch and [[Lyja|Alicia Masters]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #300</ref> The Mad Thinker later took control of the computers in Fantastic Four headquarters, but was foiled by Mister Fantastic.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #46</ref>

Mad Thinker constructed android duplicates of his favorite thinkers in order to populate his own town called "Ponder" and had one of his robots bring Captain America to that town. Most of them were destroyed by Team America and Mad Thinker was arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name="Captain America #269">''Captain America'' #269</ref>

The Mad Thinker later refused involvement in [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]'s "[[Acts of Vengeance]]". He instead escaped prison, and sent [[Gargantua (comics)|Gargantua]] against [[Wonder Man]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] in an attempt to forestall the proposed [[Registration acts (comics)#1990 Super-human Registration Act|Super-Powers Registration Act]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #28</ref> Later, he attempted a robbery using robot dinosaurs, and was foiled by [[Jack Power (Marvel Comics)|Destroyer]] and [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Tattletale]] of [[Power Pack]].<ref>''Power Pack'' #54</ref>

The Mad Thinker became interested in the young super-group called the [[New Warriors]], and posed them a riddle when they first formed.{{issue|date=May 2015}} In the final issue of the series, the answer to the riddle was revealed: the Mad Thinker's nephew had accidentally gained uncontrollable superpowers from his lab, killing his mother in the process. Now, the Thinker wanted them to help him.{{issue|date=May 2015}}

Since then, the Mad Thinker has been seen battling [[She-Hulk]] in a prison escape attempt. However, this Mad Thinker was revealed to be merely yet another android duplicate of the real Mad Thinker.{{issue|date=May 2015}} Following the destruction of this android, the Awesome Android (now calling itself Awesome Andy) took custody of the android's still-functional head,{{issue|date=May 2015}} until it was stolen by the teenage supervillain [[Southpaw (comics)|Southpaw]].{{issue|date=May 2015}}

Although willing to kill heroes who get in his way, there are lines the Mad Thinker will not cross. A partnership with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] was cut short after the kidnapping of the child [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]. The Wizard wished to experiment upon Franklin and learn the secret of his vast powers. The Mad Thinker, however, claimed that this had an almost certain probability of Franklin's death. When the Wizard acknowledged this, but decided to continue anyway, an angry Thinker dissolved the partnership and helped lead Franklin's godfather, [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]], to where the Wizard had the boy hostage.{{issue|date=May 2015}}

When [[Spider-Man]]'s dimwitted enemy [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] had an operation that made him a genius Rhino broke the Mad Thinker out of jail so that Mad Thinker could work in Rhino's crime syndicate.<ref>''Spider-Man's Tangled Web'' #5</ref>

The Mad Thinker then allies himself with the Puppet Master, planning to strike against the Fantastic Four yet again.{{issue|date=May 2015}} Told that he preferred to be called "The Thinker", The Puppet Master asked him why he had been called "The Mad Thinker" in the past. The reply was that he used to have "repressed anger issues". When the Puppet Master asks him about his anger, he replies that "it isn't repressed any more".{{issue|date=May 2015}} He has built a device to amplify the Puppet Master's power so that they can escalate a battle between the two rival factions in the [[Civil War (comics)|Super Hero Civil War]].{{issue|date=May 2015}}

In exchange for not being connected to the crimes on [[Yancy Street Gang|Yancy Street]], Reed has the Mad Thinker double-check his calculations concerning the potential effects of not supporting the registration of all superheroes.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #542</ref>

Mad Thinker, along with Awesome Android, later appear as members of the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]].<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Alpha''</ref><ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Gamma''</ref> Mad Thinker even created the Gammadroid which he used to help MODOK and [[Hulk Robot]] capture [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]].<ref name="Incredible Hulk'' #608">''Incredible Hulk'' #608</ref>

During a conflict between the Intelligencia and the [[Sinister Six]] as a prelude to the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Mad Thinker was able to briefly deactivate [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]'s powers, but was caught off-guard when Electro physically attacked him instead, the surprise of the attack allowing Electro to defeat him. He was presumably killed when [[Doctor Octopus]] used the Zero Cannon to launch him into space. MODOK Superior vows to find a way to restore his fellow Intelligencia members.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #676</ref>

MODOK Superior was able to revive Mad Thinker and the other Intelligencia members where they began to formulate their plans after their predicted shatter of the superhero community.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 2 #55</ref>

During the ''Time Runs Out'' storyline, Mad Thinker was at some point contracted by Doctor Doom to be part of his attempts at uncovering the truth behind the Incursions. Thinker managed to tap into and map the Mapmakers network, allowing them to locate the source of the Incursions.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #24</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Mad Thinker appears as a member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s incarnation of the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]].<ref>''Illuminati'' #1</ref>

Sometime later, the Mad Thinker appears in [[La Paz, Bolivia]] where he is surprised by [[Doctor Doom]] in his version of the Iron Man armor, who offers him the chance to turn his life around in exchange for a device he used in a robot. Upon refusing, Mad Thinker activated a few robots to fight Doom only for him to be defeated.<ref>''Infamous Iron Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mad Thinker is later shown to be in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.<ref>''Infamous Iron Man'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After escaping form S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Mad Thinker became obsessed with Mister Fantastic's whereabouts when he hasn't returned to Earth-616 yet. Misinterpreting Mister Fantastic's absence, Mad Thinker thinks that Mister Fantastic wants Mad Thinker to succeed him and the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Marvel 2-In-One'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> While styling his hair after Mister Fantastic and calling himself by that name, Mad Thinker hired three people named Lumen, Goodfire, and Smash to make up his Fantastic Four and gives them powers similar to the Fantastic Four. Mad Thinker now has elasticity, Lumen can become invisible with the side-effect of distorting the perception of the environment around him if he loses control of his invisibility, Goodfire has a blue fiery plasma form which she can't turn off and can also fly in this form, and Smash possesses super-strength and enhanced durability while sporting gold-colored skin. He took his Fantastic Four to follow Human Torch and Thing on their multiverse travels in order to eliminate the old remnants of the Fantastic Four. Mad Thinker's Fantastic Four confronts Human Torch and Thing in an unidentified reality. Despite Human Torch and Thing being powerless at the time, the two of them held their own against Mad Thinker's Fantastic Four until they escaped.<ref>''Marvel 2-In-One'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Mad Thinker does not have superhuman powers. However, he is an extraordinary genius with knowledge of technology centuries beyond conventional science, for reasons unexplained. He has an [[eidetic memory]] and can rapidly organize and correlate vast amounts of information and perceive non-obvious patterns. He has the facilities and means to create all manner of sophisticated weaponry, androids, armor, and vehicles.

His analytical, mathematical, and geometrical abilities are of a sophisticated order not commonly found on Earth. He is particularly adept at computers, robotics, and [[artificial intelligence]], with Ph.D.s in computer science and engineering. He has constructed his own android [[Awesome Android]] and twice resurrected the [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]]. He also built [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]] and the Scavenger, and various other equipment as needed, including monocle-sized hypno-lenses. In addition to his own achievements he has stolen much of the secret technology of Reed Richards, back in the incident when he took over the Baxter building.

The Mad Thinker is also a proficient disguise artist. Through a surgically implanted radio link, he is able to project his consciousness into an android simulacrum of himself.

The Thinker's intricate plans are most often foiled by what he refers to as the x-factor, or human unpredictability. Also the Thinker is not an intuitive genius (e.g., Reed Richards) and is thus incapable of true invention; instead, he synthesizes for his own use the creations of others (e.g., his android creations are based on discoveries of Reed Richards).

The Mad Thinker is able to escape from prison with little difficulty. He often uses his thoughts to control a robot at a remote, secret base. This gives him an alibi—he is already in prison.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint, the [[Baxter Building]] was the home of a Think Tank of young geniuses, funded by the US Government. A girl named '''Rhona Burchill''' was considered for the project, but was denied due to her borderline psychotic tendencies. Enraged, she went home and concocted an accelerant that would allow her to think many times faster. Needing more brain mass to handle the drug, she [[Anesthetic|anesthetized]] her brother Bobby, and using a crude surgical technique, cut out portions of his brain and grafted them onto her own. Claiming that "You don't need a Think Tank - You just need a thinker", she attacks the Baxter Building and lays a trap that ensnares the Fantastic Four, several soldiers and Fantastic Four supervisor [[Willie Lumpkin|Lt. Lumpkin]]. When she tells her story in her now [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] speech pattern to the Four, Reed calls her mad. She replies, "If it's mad to think the unthinkable, then I'm the maddest thinker there ever was". Based on this comment, she has since been referred to as the Mad Thinker.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #19-20</ref>

She also appeared as the villain in the ''[[Ultimate X4]]'' miniseries which showed her with an android resembling the Awesome Android which she calls [[Robby the Robot|Robby]]. During this appearance she attempted to steal [[Cerebro]] and use it to gain control of all the minds on the planet, but, with the aid of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], the Fantastic Four were able to distract her until Reed could reprogram Cerebro to cause Rhona to develop the power of empathy rather than control, forcing her to shut Cerebro down or lose herself amid the pain of the world. Though she attempts to escape, Wolverine had cut a certain hose in her escape vehicle, causing it to explode on her when she activates the after burners.<ref>''Ultimate X4'' #2</ref>

===What If?===
In a parody issue of ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'', the entry entitled "Spidey Intellectual Stories" (a send-up of [[The Electric Company|The Electric Company's]] ''[[Spidey Super Stories]]'') has [[Spider-Man]] defeating the Mad Thinker by debating philosophy, severely boring the observing [[Uatu|Uatu the Watcher]].<ref>''What If?'' vol. 1 #34</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Mad Thinker appeared in the "Iron Man" segment of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Len Carlson]].
* The Mad Thinker is referenced in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "This Forest Green." When Egghead boasts that no one is more clever than him, Doctor Doom mentions Reed Richards, Bruce Banner, and Mad Thinker.
* The Mad Thinker appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Danny Mann]]. In the episode "The Man in the Ant Hill," Mad Thinker is an inmate at the [[Big House (comics)|Big House]]. He tells Whirlwind that he has planned many ways of escape. He mentions to Whirlwind that the Big House is one of the four major supervillain prisons and that when their systems break down, every villain will take the opportunity to escape. In the episode "The Breakout" Pt. 1, Ant-Man visits Mad Thinker's cell when he saw footage of Mad Thinker's conversation with Whirlwind. During that time, the Big House's security systems break down as Mad Thinker predicted. He takes the opportunity to escape during the chaos.
* The Ultimate version of Mad Thinker appears in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'', voiced by [[Brenna O'Brien]]. She is a gothic girl named '''Rhona Erwin''' who was the smartest girl at the Tomorrow Academy until Tony Stark enrolled. In the episode "Ready A.I.M. Fire," Rhonda and [[Awesome Android|Andy]] are mentioned when discussing [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Basil Sandhurst]]'s conversation with Tony. In the episode "Enter: Iron Monger," she and Tony had an argument in class causing the teacher to send Tony to the principal's office. In the episode "All the Best People are Mad," Rhona and her brother Andy slip sleeping gas into the school and places Tony into competing the D.A.T.s (short for Deadly Aptitude Tests) with [[Pepper Potts]], [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]], and [[Madame Masque|Whitney Stane]] placed in different death traps (similar to the ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' franchise). Her motive in this is that she claims the Tony is a fraud in geniuses. In Tony's first test, Pepper is chained to a pole in the auditorium with its shackles being part of his history question and uses the mirrors and amplified lights referencing the question on who invented the first laser that was used to sink Roman ships in Ancient Rome. Upon guessing [[Archimedes]], Pepper is freed upon Tony guessing it right. When asked by Andy if he can activate the next death trap, Rhona tells him that she is the supervillain and he's just her henchman. With James Rhodes, Whitney Stane, and Happy Hogan's lives threatened, Tony is forced to continue the D.A.T.s. For the second challenge revolving around math, James Rhodes is strapped to a round table with a chainsaw descending on it. Upon reaching Room 314, the floor is rigged with traps that launch saw blades upon the wrong plates being stepped on. Tony ends up going on the numbers that represents Double Pi and saves James. Rhona goes by Andy's requests by having Tony uses one of his friends for his lifeline. For the third challenge revolving around philosophy, Happy Hogan is strapped to an electric chair. When asked who said "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think therefore I am]]", Tony states [[René Descartes]] and Happy Hogan ends up freed. For the fourth challenge revolving around music, Whitney Stane is trapped in a container that is slowly filling with poison gas. Tony is told to identify the musical piece that was playing and Happy helps Tony to identify [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 3]] and Whitney Stane is freed. Rhona then ends up going on the final question revolving around physics where she asks what is the heaviest nucleus. With help from his friends, Tony ends up disarming the bomb before it can blow up the East Wing. Displeased at losing, Rhona sends Andy to take care of Tony's friends. After Andy is knocked down by Iron Man, Rhona uses a laser gun that was based on [[Henry Pym]]'s gun. Rhona ends up fighting Whitney Stane and Pepper Potts. When Andy is badly damaged by Iron Man, Rhona is devastated by this as Andy shuts down in Rhona's arms. Rhona is arrested by the FBI upon their arrival. Rhona is revealed by Pepper's father to be '''Rhona Burchill''' who had escaped from [[Ravencroft]] (where she was after she tried to blow up the [[Baxter Building|Baxter School]]) and that Andy was created to be the closest thing she has to family. Rhona vows to make Iron Man pay, quoting William Shakespeare's [[Merchant of Venice]]. Rhona is then taken away by a Ravencroft doctor that is actually one of her androids, meaning she has already made preparations for another escape.

===Miscellaneous===
