'''Shuma-Gorath''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|uː|m|ə|_|ˈ|g|ɔːr|æ|θ}}) is a [[character (fiction)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

==Publication history==
Shuma-Gorath first appears as an adversary for [[Doctor Strange]] in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #5 (November 1972), created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Frank Brunner]]. The character's name is taken from [[Robert E. Howard]]'s short story "The Curse of the Golden Skull", which features a dying magician named Rotath invoking the "iron-bound books of Shuma-Gorath" in a curse against humanity.

==Fictional character biography==
During Earth's pre-history Shuma-Gorath ruled the world, and demanded [[human sacrifice]] until eventually banished by time-traveling sorcerer [[Sise-Neg]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #14 (March 1974). Marvel Comics</ref> The entity eventually returns during the [[Hyborian Age]], but is imprisoned within a mountain by the power of the god [[Crom (fictional deity)|Crom]].<ref>''Conan the Barbarian'' #240 (Jan. 1991). Marvel Comics</ref> Shuma-Gorath continues to be an influence on Earth until returned to its home dimension by Crom.<ref>''Conan the Barbarian'' #260 (Sept. 1992). Marvel Comics</ref>

When the entity tries to return to Earth via the mind of the [[Ancient One]], his disciple Doctor Strange is forced to kill him to prevent this.<ref>''Marvel Première'' #3-10 (July 1972 - Sept. 1973). Marvel Comics</ref> Years later, Strange battles Shuma-Gorath in its home dimension, and although victorious, he gradually becomes a new version of the entity. Strange commits suicide to prevent this transformation and is resurrected by an ally.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 2 #15 (June 1988). Marvel Comics</ref> Sorcerer [[Nicholas Scratch]] summons the entity to Earth but it is driven back by the combined efforts of Doctor Strange, the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Salem's Seven]] and villain [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]].<ref>''Marvel Knights 4'' 25-27 (Feb. - April 2006. Marvel Comics</ref>

Shuma-Gorath is eventually revealed to be one of the four undying extra-dimensional "[[Many-angled ones|multi-angled ones]]" guiding a metaphysical invasion from a dimension called the "[[The Thanos Imperative|cancerverse]]". In attempting to destroy [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] itself, the entity and its allies are rendered inert by the conceptual form of Death and subsequently are trapped in the cancerverse when it is destroyed.<ref name="TI6">''Thanos Imperative'' #6 (Nov. 2010)</ref> Shuma-Gorath survives and once again attempts to invade Earth but is repelled by the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with the [[Spear of Destiny]].<ref>''Invaders Now!'' #5 (Apr. 2011)</ref>

During the 2011 "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Shuma-Gorath is among the demons to meet at the Devil's Advocacy to discuss the threat of the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]] and what this means to them.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #627. Marvel Comics</ref>

During the 2013 "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" storyline, [[Thanos]]' servant [[Ebony Maw]] manipulates Doctor Strange into summoning Shuma-Gorath to the streets of New York. The creature is met by [[Luke Cage]] and his [[The Mighty Avengers|new team of Avengers]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' vol. 2 #2 (October 2013). Marvel Comics</ref> [[Blue Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Blue Marvel]] arrives at the scene of the battle and flies through Shuma-Gorath's head, destroying its physical manifestation. Shuma-Gorath's astral body possesses a crowd of people in New York City and attempts to recreate itself on Earth. It is weakened through mystical attacks by [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Power Man]] and [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]] and finally banished by [[Monica Rambeau]], who penetrates Shuma-Gorath's eye as a ray of light and disperses the entity from within.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics</ref>

The ''Last Days of Magic'' storyline describes Shuma-Gorath as responsible for destroying the home planet of the character Imperator, leader of the Empirikul, by sending a group of evil sorcerers after his family. This leads to the Imperator to dedicate his life to destroying magic in every universe.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 4 #7</ref>

Later, during a battle, [[Dormammu]] states to Doctor Strange that he helped the Empirikul in finding Shuma-Gorath, who was defeated by the Imperator. Doctor Strange later banishes Dormammu to Shuma-Gorath itself, who was visibly wounded and seeking revenge.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 4 #16</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Shuma-Gorath is an ancient force of chaos, the immortal, nigh-invincible, and godlike ruler of nearly a hundred alternate universes, capable of energy projection, [[shapeshifting]], [[teleportation]], [[levitation]], altering reality, and [[sympathetic magic]] among many other feats. He is described as being vastly more powerful than other mighty demonic enemies, such as [[Satannish]] and [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], and is capable of automatically destroying multiple galaxies through aura-pressure alone.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 2 #14 (June 1988)</ref>
