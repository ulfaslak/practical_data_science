==Fictional character history==
Barney Barton was born in Waverly, Iowa. He lost both his parents at a young age when his father, an abusive alcoholic, lost control of his car and collided with a tree. Barney and his younger brother [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint]] were sent to an orphanage. They stayed there for six years before running away to join the Carson Carnival of Travelling Wonder as roustabouts.<ref name="avengers65">''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #65 (June 1969)</ref> The [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]], a member of the carnival with a popular swordplay act, selected Clint to be his new assistant. Feeling overlooked, Barney became jealous and bitter. Later, when Clint was severely injured at the hands of the Swordsman for discovering his embezzlement scheme, Barney condemned his brother for not remaining loyal to his mentor.<ref name="hawkeyebs1">''[[Hawkeye: Blindspot]]'' #1 (Apr. 2011)</ref> Barney, having had enough of the carnival, decided to enlist in the army. He suggested that Clint should join him and make a fresh start. Clint declined his offer. Barney told his brother that the offer still stood, and he would wait for him if he changed his mind. The next morning, Barney stood at the bus depot, waiting and hoping his brother would change his mind. When Clint didn't show, a sorrowful Barney got on the bus and left his old life behind. As the bus was departing, Clint arrived, having changed his mind. However, he was too late.<ref name="hawkeyev34">''[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]'' vol. 3, #4 (Mar. 2004)</ref>

Barney later became an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent. His first assignment was to work undercover as a bodyguard for a criminal called Marko.<ref name="hawkeyev36">''Hawkeye'' vol. 3, #6 (May 2004)</ref> Unbeknownst to him, Clint and his new mentor [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] attempted to rob the criminal's mansion. Barney was shot with an arrow by Clint. When Clint learned what he had done, he refused to leave his brother's side and turned against Trick Shot. Trick Shot wounded Clint with an arrow and left.<ref name="hawkeyev35">''Hawkeye'' vol. 3, #5 (Apr. 2004)</ref>

His next undercover assignment was to pose as a racketeer. He was approached by [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], who offered Barney a place on his villainous space-station in exchange for funds. When Barney declined the offer, Egghead (actually a robot sent by the real Egghead) attacked him. With his bodyguards slain, Barney went to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] (whose ranks included his brother Clint, then using the Goliath identity) to help stop the supervillain. Barney and the Avengers battled Egghead and his robot soldiers inside the villain's space-station. During the battle, Barney sacrificed his life to destroy Egghead's deadly ray-projector.<ref name="avengers64">''Avengers'' #64 (May 1969)</ref> After the funeral, Clint received a letter from FBI agent Allan Scofield revealing Barney's double life. The letter also revealed that Barney was aware of Clint's double life.<ref name="hawkeyev36"/>

Unbeknownst to Hawkeye and the Avengers, Barney's body was stolen by Egghead. Egghead discovered that Barney was still displaying faint vital signs and placed him in a healing chamber.<ref name="hawkeyebs3">''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #3 (June 2011)</ref> Later, Egghead was inadvertently killed by Hawkeye in a battle with the Avengers, leaving Barney suspended and forgotten in the healing chamber.<ref name="avengers228229">''Avengers'' #228-229 (Feb. - Mar. 1983)</ref> He was later discovered by [[Baron Zemo]]. Zemo, who held a personal grudge against Hawkeye, manipulated Barney to turn against his brother.<ref name="hawkeyebs3"/> Barney and his new "benefactor" enlisted Hawkeye's former mentor [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] (whose cancer had returned) to train him to be as proficient with a bow and arrow as his brother. Once the training was completed, Trick Shot was badly beaten and his cancer was allowed to fester. Barney then delivered a dying Trick Shot to [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] as a message to Hawkeye.<ref name="hawkeyebs1"/> Later, while investigating his former mentor's death, Hawkeye was ambushed by his brother.<ref name="hawkeyebs2">''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #2 (May 2011)</ref> Declaring himself as the new Trick Shot (altering it to Trickshot), Barney subdued Hawkeye and delivered him to Baron Zemo.<ref name="hawkeyebs3"/> Zemo had the brothers duel to the death. Hawkeye (despite going blind from a previous injury with the third [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]) managed to best Trickshot in battle. Before teleporting away, Zemo transferred Trickshot's criminal funds over to the "victor" Hawkeye, then taunted the hero for turning his brother against him. In custody, Trickshot agreed to a bone marrow transplant to save his brother's sight, but only so he could battle Hawkeye again in the future.<ref>''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #4 (July 2011)</ref>

[[Norman Osborn]] later fakes Trickshot's death in his hospital bed as Norman invites Trickshot to join his second incarnation of the [[Dark Avengers]].<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 2 #18 (Nov. 2011)</ref> Despite the new team's initial success, he was finally defeated in a fight with [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] when he underestimated her capabilities as Mockingbird having recently been enhanced by the Super Soldier Serum/Infinity Formula hybrid.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #23</ref> After being arrested, Trickshot and the rest of the villains (save for [[Superia]] and [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]]) are offered reduced sentences in exchange for signing on with the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] program.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' (vol. 2) #175</ref> Barney remains with the team until the Dark Avengers escape their handlers and disband.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' (vol. 2) #190</ref>

Sometime after dissolution of the group, a homeless and disheveled Barney goes to live with Clint, with whom he apparently reconciled, at his new apartment.<ref>''Hawkeye ''(vol. 4) #12</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New All-Different Marvel]]'', it is revealed that Barney had stolen Clint's wealth and moved to a private island to start a family with Simone, one of Clint's former neighbors.<ref>"Hawkeye"(vol. 4) #22</ref> In "All-New Hawkeye," she is referred to by the name "Cheryl" despite being referred to as "Simone" throughout ''Hawkeye'' (vol. 4). Despite this, the two brothers remain on good terms. He even assisted Clint and Kate in rescuing the Project Communion kids from HYDRA and S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''All-New Hawkeye'' #3</ref>
