The '''Leader''' ('''Samuel Sterns''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Leader first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #62, created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] as an enemy of [[Bruce Banner|the Hulk]]. He has mainly appeared in Hulk related comic books over the years and was one of the featured characters in the [[Marvel NOW!]] [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] relaunch. In 2009, The Leader was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 63rd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/63.html Leader is number 63] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510083549/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/63.html |date=2009-05-10 }}, [[IGN]].</ref>

Sterns worked as a janitor in [[Boise, Idaho]] when he was exposed to [[gamma radiation]]. The radiation mutated him into a green skinned, super-intelligent entity who names himself the Leader, embarking on a career of crime. He is repeatedly foiled by the Hulk, who overcomes all of the Leader's schemes as well as his artificial henchmen known as the Humanoids. Sterns would later be further transformed, causing his cranium to change into the shape of an oversized brain. As part of the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]] he is an integral part of the ''[[Hulked Out Heroes]]'' storyline.

Actor [[Tim Blake Nelson]] portrays Dr. Samuel Sterns in the 2008 superhero film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Born Samuel Sterns in [[Boise]], [[Idaho]], he worked for a [[chemical plant]] in a menial capacity. While moving radioactive materials into an underground storage area, some of the radioactive materials explode, bombarding Sterns with [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]]. He recovers, and finds that the [[radiation]] has changed him from an ordinary human into a green-skinned, super-intelligent entity with an oversized brain housed in a towering cranium.<ref name="Tales to Astonish #63">''Tales to Astonish'' #63</ref> As is the case with most individuals mutated by gamma radiation early-on, the particular set of characteristics Sterns acquired by exposure to it were said to result from a subconscious desire; in his case, the desire to be as smart as his brother Philip, who was a physicist in the employ of the same facility. Calling himself the Leader, Sterns embarks on various ambitious criminal schemes, with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] as his primary nemesis, consistently backed by a self-constructed army of super-strong, virtually invulnerable plastic Humanoids.

The Leader creates a spy ring to overthrow the [[United States]] [[USFG|federal government]]. He sends a spy to steal a robot Dr. [[Bruce Banner]] was developing. The spy is knocked into a deep pit by the Hulk, and is trapped there. The Leader dispatches the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to find out why the spy has failed to report back.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #60-62</ref> Although the Chameleon fails at this, he informs the Leader of the secret shipment of a newly developed nuclear device, the Absorbatron. The Leader sends a Humanoid to steal the device. The Humanoid is stopped by the Hulk, who the Leader sees for the first time through his Humanoid's eyes. He deduces that the Hulk is a creation of gamma radiation like himself, and becomes immediately obsessed with learning more about him.<ref name="Tales to Astonish #63"/> Thus, though he sends out a horde of Humanoids to seize the Absorbatron while it is being tested on a deserted island, when the Hulk is sighted there he focuses on capturing him instead, now convinced that the two of them are "fated to become allies". However, the Hulk is unwittingly saved from capture by US army troops.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #64-65</ref> A third attempt at stealing the Absorbatron is successful, and the Hulk is delivered into the Leader's hands at the same time. However, while the Leader is still scientifically studying him, the Hulk breaks free and proves impossible to reason with. He destroys the Absorbatron, and the Leader narrowly escapes with his life.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #68-69</ref> In order to sell his {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall Humanoid to hostile nations, the Leader arranges a demonstration of its power by ordering it to attack a nearby missile base. However, the army hits the Humanoid with a "Sunday Punch" missile, rendering it inoperative.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #70-71</ref> When the army subsequently corners the Hulk in a cave, the Leader rescues him, and the two become uneasy allies.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #72</ref> The Leader operates on the Hulk to remove what would have been a fatal bullet in his skull, and further enhances his strength with a shower of gamma rays. The two of them team up to steal the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]'s "Ultimate Machine", a device containing all the knowledge in the universe.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #73</ref> Rather than stop them directly, the Watcher implants within the device an image so horrifying that using it causes the Leader to collapse dead from sheer terror.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #74</ref> However, the Leader had made preparations even for his death; a special humanoid is programmed to activate when his heart stops beating, and carry the Leader to a "Revivo-Beam" which would restore him, since his gamma-infused body takes longer to reach [[brain death]] than that of a normal person. In addition, his usage of the Ultimate Machine apparently unlocked several previously latent mental powers.<ref name="Incredible115">''Incredible Hulk'' #115</ref>

After months in hiding, the Leader offers [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]] aid in neutralizing the Hulk, containing him within a cage of plastithene.<ref name="Incredible115"/> However, [[Betty Ross]] overhears the Leader gloating to himself about his real plan: to take over the base and use its nuclear missiles to set off a nuclear war, thus annihilating most of humanity and making it easy for him to take over. She frees the Hulk, who stops the Leader's plan. However, the Leader escapes and uses his powers to erase all memory of his scheme from the base's inhabitants except Ross.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #116-117</ref> The Leader hijacks the U.S. Army's Murder Module vehicle, but it is then destroyed by the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #123</ref> As revenge, he interrupts the wedding of Banner (the Hulk's alter ego) and Ross by shooting Banner with a ray which turns him into an unusually savage form of the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #124</ref> After briefly turning back into Samuel Sterns to question Banner about the Hulk's possible weaknesses, he resurrects the [[Glob (comics)#Joseph "Joe" Timms|Glob]] and brainwashes him into attacking the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #129</ref> The Leader next tries petitioning General Ross and Major [[Glenn Talbot]] to let him use the U.S. Army's Brain-Wave Booster, a mental amplifier so powerful that no normal human can use it. In a [[retcon]] of his earlier mind-wipe, Ross and Talbot remember the Leader's attempt to set off nuclear Armageddon, but they trust him to use the device responsibly anyway. He briefly uses the device to beset the Hulk with three-dimensional projections of his enemies, but the Brain-Wave Booster proves too advanced for even the Leader's brain, and it causes him to suffer a mental breakdown.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #139</ref> The Leader then creates android duplicates of the President, Vice President, and military personnel in an attempt to kidnap the real President and Vice President.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #146-147</ref> He then superimposed his consciousness upon the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] in order to battle the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #157-159</ref> He later used the Hulk and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] as pawns in a contest with [[Kurrgo]] the Planet Master.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #11</ref>

Some time later, the Leader briefly took over Gamma Base.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #223-225</ref> Some time after that, he gamma-irradiated Manhattan's water supply in an attempt to mutate humanity into green-skinned beings like himself.<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #11</ref> He later activated [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]], and then dispatched the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] through time.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #280-284</ref>

After a period of time, the gamma radiation in his body began to wear off. At first, the Leader attributed his lapses in concentration to overworking his mind finding ways to defeat his greatest enemy (the Hulk). By the time the Leader realized what was happening, much of the intelligence that could have solved his plight was gone and texts that were once child's play to him were now hopelessly beyond him (he even forgot the access code of his secret base). In this period, he made cash however he could by means fair or foul, until he managed to convince the Gray Hulk to help him regain his intelligence by promising that he would help the latter to remain the Hulk full-time (instead of only at night).{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

[[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] had been afflicted with a Hulk-like condition and the Hulk (using Bruce Banner's memories of gamma transfer) devised a machine to transfer all of the gamma radiation from Rick Jones to the Leader. However, this time the mutagenic process was slightly different resulting in a cranium that resembled an oversized brain, rather than a towering forehead. He was also a lighter shade of green. As a side note, this transfer also created a psychic link between the two.<ref name="Incredible Hulk #342">''Incredible Hulk'' #342</ref>

Soon after this, the Leader would steal the seemingly lifeless body of General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] from the back of an ambulance, simply because it was there, and later managed to revive it as a mindless vegetable, which he used as an armored enforcer.<ref name="Incredible Hulk #400">''Incredible Hulk'' #400</ref>

Before long, the Leader's new form was revealed, and he dispatched [[Halflife (comics)#Half-Life (Anthony Masterson)|Half-Life]] to battle the Hulk.<ref name="Incredible Hulk #342"/> The Leader dispatched an army of four-armed robots against the Hulk, and created Rock and Redeemer.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #343</ref>

The Leader dispatched Rock and Redeemer against the Hulk. Following this the Leader engaged in a scheme to detonate a gamma-bomb in a small-town city, Middletown, Arizona, killing over 5,000 people, and the few, now enhanced, survivors provided him with valuable research subjects and superhuman enforcers called the [[Riot Squad (comics)|Riot Squad]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #344-345</ref> With their help, he built a self-sufficient society called Freehold in the Arctic, populated with civilians dying from radiation poisoning. Some time afterward he gave the Hulk information how to find his brother, Philip Sterns, the [[Madman (Marvel Comics)|Madman]], since he thought it would be best to put the latter out of his suffering, due to his original personality being slowly and painfully eaten away by the Madman persona.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #366</ref>

After Jones suffered a great mental trauma due to the death of his girlfriend Marlo Chandler, his pain was enough to cause the Leader considerable discomfort, motivating him to work towards the revival of Marlo. At this time Freehold was targeted by a rogue branch of [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] terrorists, employing the [[U-Foes]] and his followers to invade the covert [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] organization, of which Hulk was a member, to coerce them to help him in defending it. He employed something he ironically called the ''Deus Ex Machina'' in conjunction with his follower, the gamma-enhanced Reverend nicknamed Soul Man, who falsely believed himself to have been blessed by God with spiritual power, rather than given nearly godlike abilities by the Leader, in an effort to revive Marlo and siphon off Soul Man's power for himself. Rick Jones became convinced to accept the help after seeing the mindless, but mobile, body of Thunderbolt Ross.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #397-399</ref>

The Hulk, manipulated by the leader of the Pantheon, Agamemnon, attacked the facility. At the same time, HYDRA decided to storm the base, leading to a multi-sided battle. The Hulk eventually personally attacked the Leader, who, along with Soul Man, seemingly perished in the crossfire. The machine was likewise demolished, causing Marlo to enter a state similar to Ross, but both eventually fully recovered.<ref name="Incredible Hulk #400"/>

The death of the Leader left his follower Omnibus in control of Freehold. Omnibus used mind-control to manipulate several U.S. Chiefs of Staff, and engineered many high-profile terrorist strikes to incite global warfare, as he reasoned that it was inevitable, and hurrying it along offered him opportunity to enable his personal society to survive and inherit the Earth. Omnibus was eventually exposed by his fellow Freehold citizens, judged to die in the cold, and was eaten by a polar bear.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #442</ref> Bruce Banner also saw the Leader in a supposed trip to Hell.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

A while later, the Hulk, who in his Bruce Banner persona was suffering from a degenerative nervous condition (which would ultimately kill him), was confronted by the Leader once again. Apparently he really had perished when the Deus Ex Machina was destroyed, but his disembodied consciousness had evolved beyond the need for a body. Although he was in the process of building a new body out of random organic materials, in a secluded cave near Gamma Base, he was preparing to leave this level of reality behind altogether, transcending both beyond the physical and his old goals. Yet before he did so, he intended to cure Bruce Banner for reasons all his own. After he had done so, he abandoned his body. However, later still his consciousness once again contacted Banner, apparently shocked by what he had discovered "beyond the veil"; he was unable to return, however, and was not heard from again until much later.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #30-32</ref>

During a time of great personal duress for the Hulk and Bruce Banner, who had begun to merge their personas, it became clear that Home Base, a secret organization who had relentlessly pursued the Hulk in order to obtain his genetic material, was secretly led by the Leader. In the end, after all his other agendas had failed, the Leader finally managed to mind-control the Hulk and guided him towards his secret base, with the intention of taking his indestructible body for himself. Because of intervention by Nadia Blonsky, [[Betty Ross]], [[Doc Samson]], and [[Iron Man]], the plan failed and the Leader died again.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #75-76</ref>

These events, bizarre and nebulous as they seem, may or may not have taken place in this form...they may be partly true, or entirely a construct by the extra-dimensional demon [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] in a bid to avenge himself on the Hulk.{{issue|date=October 2012}} At present, the Leader has a body incorporating traits from both his previous incarnations; it is unknown exactly how he acquired it, but it may have been relatively easy, given his history.{{issue|date=October 2012}}

The Leader is captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Hulkbusters#S.H.I.E.L.D's Hulkbusters|Hulkbusters]], and brought to trial for his crimes. He was represented by Attorney Mallory Book from [[She-Hulk]]'s firm [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]]. During the trial, Ms. Book argued that the Leader was not responsible for his actions since the gamma exposure forcibly changed his personality. To prove her point, Book compared She-Hulk to Jennifer Walters, revealing that Jennifer was much more [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] in her She-Hulk form. In the second day of the trial, the Leader's humanoids arrived to rescue him. Instead of escaping, the Leader called off the attack, opting to see the trial to its conclusion, as he correctly predicted that his defense was going to win. He was found not guilty.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 4 #20</ref> It is as yet unclear whether this person is indeed the original Leader, or the Samuel Sterns of "Earth-Alpha", the inhabitants of which had been swapping places with their 616 counterparts for a while prior to this trial.

Now a free man (whichever one he may be), the Leader teleported the Hulk's allies, the [[Warbound]], to Nevada. There, he used [[Hiroim]] of the Warbound, harnessing his tectonic power to activate a gamma powered shield over a portion of the desert. It is revealed that the Leader is dying, and that he constructed the dome to cure him. Due to a miscalculation, the energy of the dome actually kills him faster.<ref>''World War Hulk: Aftersmash! Warbound'' #3</ref> In battle with the Warbound, the Leader is stabbed through the chest with an iron pipe. The Leader then absorbed the power of the dome, turning himself into a gray-skinned giant. Hiroim also absorbed the power, and battled the Leader, draining both of their powers. In death, Hiroim channels his old power into Kate Waynseboro, who attacks the Leader, and forces him to teleport away.<ref>''Warbound'' #5</ref>

The Leader, apparently healthy and in the form he originally had, appears once again, this time with designs on the Hulk's son Skaar. It is eventually revealed that he, along with a select group of genius super-villains, is part of a longtime collaboration he calls the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]].<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Alpha'' #1</ref> Leader was also responsible for mutating [[Marlo Chandler]] into the new Harpy. During that time, he planned revenge on Kate Waynesboro.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #604</ref>

At the conclusion of the Red Hulk storyline, a newly rejuvenated Red Hulk approaches the Leader and gets close enough to him to completely drain the body-altering gamma radiation from the Leader's physiology. Red Hulk does this as a punishment for the Leader's altering of Ross's/Red Hulk's daughter into the Red She-Hulk. Red Hulk leaves Sterns alive to suffer, reminding him that as the person he has been reverted to with his original, well below-average intelligence, Sterns will never be able to duplicate a gamma-infusion and restore his powers as the Leader...at least not on his own.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #23</ref>

A powerless Leader is later seen in custody demanding "gamma" (the one thing no one is willing to give him) if he was to divulge any information on stopping the Intelligencia's failsafe doomsday plans.<ref>''Hulk'' #28</ref>

===Marvel Now!===
At the end of the second issue of the new ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' series as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, a powerless Samuel Sterns is seen apparently housed within a shipping container. His head is connected to a machine apparently emitting red gamma radiation (in the fashion of the Red Hulk) with the harness in the shape of the Leader's formerly tall head. Samuel Sterns is apparently in the custody of Red Hulk.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2 #2</ref> During the third issue, Samuel Sterns has reddish-hued skin, but with no apparent powers. Once Deadpool sees that the Red Hulk is employing Samuel Sterns, he expresses his view that the Punisher will not be pleased. As soon as the Punisher sees Samuel Sterns, he shoots him right between the eyes, killing him and foiling the Red Hulk's plan.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2 #3</ref> During the fight against Madman, Red Hulk took him to a pipe line that feeds gamma energy to Madman's lab.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2 #4</ref> Red Hulk then absorbed the energy himself and then force-fed it to the Leader, bringing him back to life.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2 #5</ref> Leader then joins the Thunderbolts under the new alias Red Leader. Red Leader then realized that his brother, Madman, had tricked him into divulging where he hid his second brain and the algorithm hiding it—it was on the Internet. After gaining back his memory and intellect he then whispers something into his brother's ears that causes him to die.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2 #6</ref>

Red Leader then tricks the Thunderbolts into taking names out of a hat to decide whose mission will be next. He picks the name, since he has "no skin in the game", and chooses Punisher, since he knows he will want to go to New York City. He hopes to escape Ross, but the [[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity crossover]] occurs and he is forced to release [[Mercy (comics)|Mercy]] when [[Black Order (comics)|Supergiant of Thanos' Black Order]] sucks out part of his intellect. He then helps Red Hulk destroy the Black Order's flagship, but only for self-preservation. He constantly broods over how he should kill the rest of the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2 #19</ref>

Later the team is teleported to Hell and Red Leader then negotiates a contract with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] that if [[Ghost Rider]] and Red Hulk defeat the current leader of Hell, [[Strong Guy]], they will be teleported out and Mephisto will take control of Mercy, as well as other secret stipulations.<ref name="Thunderbolts vol. 2 #20">''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2 #20</ref>

Red Leader then helps the team navigate the haunted swamps of [[Honduras]] since he can translate an ancient map. During the boat ride he whispers something in an ancient language that causes Ghost Rider to lose his powers and get devoured by a tentacled monster. Their river guide then makes a deal with Red Leader to betray his team, but Red Leader double-crosses him and the team kills the guide's ambush. Red Leader then tells the team to enter the temple, but via a booby-trapped path that gets them all killed, except for Ross, who finds the source of the temple's power—an infant [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]'s head. Red Leader is killed when his head explodes after drinking the Celestial's blood. He and the team are revived when Ross makes a deal with a Celestial-powered being and teleports them back to before the mission started.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2 #26</ref>

After Punisher quits the team, Red Leader, long looking for ways to kill the Thunderbolts and knowing Castle had countermeasures to take each of them down, puts a bomb in his safe house with a note saying "You don't quit us. You're fired" knowing that he would survive and that he would think it was Ross who attempted to kill him and thus would take the Thunderbolts down.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2 #31</ref>

Six months after the Thunderbolts disbanded, Red Leader had built his own criminal empire in Kata Jaya. Living a life of luxury and trying to conquer the heart of the girl he was in love with, Red Leader saw everything he had built be destroyed by his former partners and the Avengers. Betrayed by Caitlin (the girl he loved), Red Leader was captured by them and put in jail. Punisher used the Ghost Rider's skull to put Red Leader under a permanent Penance Stare, but he was eventually freed from it by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] (with whom he had made a deal when he went to Hell along with the Thunderbolts).<ref name="Thunderbolts vol. 2 #20"/> Enraged by the fact that Red Leader had reneged on their deal, Mephisto made him sign a new contract and led him to Hell.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2 #32</ref>

As part of his measure to neutralize gamma mutates across the world, Hulk's Doc Green form pinned down Red Leader, who, through unknown means, had escaped from Hell, started to play with occultism and neutralized his gamma-powered abilities. However, Red Leader had reached out previously to Gammon (an artificial intelligence duplicate of Doc Green) who had implemented a countermeasure against Doc Green's actions. As soon as he was depowered, Red Leader slowly transformed again. However, instead of transforming back into Samuel Sterns, Red Leader transformed back to Leader. He and Gammon agreed to work together.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 3 #13</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Leader has superhuman [[mind|mental]] acumen, as a result of his exposure to an explosion of gamma-irradiated waste. He is capable of knowledge and comprehension beyond the human ability to understand. The potential of his intelligence is nearly unlimited, being capable of mastering every worldly subject and adopting concepts completely foreign to his environment. His higher brain functions, including pattern recognition, information storage and retrieval, and logical and philosophical structuring have been enhanced to inhuman levels, has total recall of every event he has witnessed since the accident that transformed him, and can calculate possibilities and outcomes so accurately that it borders on predicting the future. Despite his limitless intelligence and supreme knowledge, his effectiveness is greatly hampered by his own arrogance, immaturity, and obsession with defeating the Hulk which constantly causes him to lose sight of necessary details and act prematurely, causing the ruin of his schemes. Lately, his egotism has led him to embark on mad, impractical schemes to turn the rest of humanity into green-skinned beings like himself.

After the Leader revived himself after his near-death exposure to the Watcher's Ultimate Machine, he has unlocked previously latent telekinetic and telepathic powers within him. He is able to control the minds of ordinary humans by touching them (aside from gamma-mutated individuals like Hulk or Abomination), wipe memories of several humans at once, create illusions to trick others or disguise himself, and project telekinetic blasts potent enough to topple a very weakened Hulk.

Leader is also a technological genius that specializes in gamma radiation. He has created a large array of technology far beyond human ability, including vehicles, weaponry, computers, androids, and synthetic lifeforms, and is particularly adept at genetic engineering and manipulating radiation for many nefarious purposes. These include personal weapons like laser pistols, pulse weapons, kinetic gauntlets, etc. Leader also has an army of synthetic henchmen at his disposal called "Humanoids", which have served the Leader throughout his career of world domination, mainly as bodyguards, soldiers, and lab servants. They are have versatile programming capacities to allow them to perform any task, do not tire or need sustenance, and have elastic-like bodies that harmlessly absorb impacts. The Humanoids are usually controlled directly through Leader's own mental commands, but can also be pre-programmed to carry out a certain directive. Leader has also developed gamma bombs, shield generators to cover large areas, cages for holding the Hulk, teleportation devices, android duplicates, a means of controlling the minds of the Hulk or Rhino through devices,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #157-159</ref><ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #75-76</ref> a Revivor Beam which was designed to restore him to life in the event of his death,<ref name="Incredible115">''Incredible Hulk'' #115</ref> and Omnivac,{{issue|date=November 2018}} a sentient computer that maintains the space station he has used as a base of operations.

On occasion, the Leader showed the ability to turn himself back into Samuel Sterns, but this ability resulted in him losing all memory of his identity as the Leader as Stern's mind was ill-equipped to cope with the Leader's intellect (although he always remembered everything when he turned back into the Leader again).

===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in===
Prior to the release of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' in 2012, Marvel ran a series of canon tie-in comics entitled ''Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week'', which take place within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. In issues #6-7, Sterns is seen undergoing a rapid head mutation just as he is discovered by [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)#Film|Natasha Romanoff]] who stumbles upon him immediately after Hulk has escaped. Although his brainpower has already drastically increased to the point where he can pinpoint the exact location of Black Widow's birth just by a brief hint of [[Stalingrad]] in her accent, Natasha shoots him in the leg when he attempts to bribe her by offering to help her return to her home and he is detained into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.<ref>''The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week'' #6-7 (March 2012)</ref>

He has a giant hole blown through his [[cranium]] which does not stop him.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness'' #3 (2007)</ref> He is also in ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' where he is looking over food and medical supplies that other zombies have found as an offering to a zombie [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. The Leader determines how long the others can feed on the human clones. The Leader is sent with other zombified superbeings to find and destroy the [[Machine Man]]. The android gains the upper hand in the battle and destroys all his pursuers. The Zombie Leader then kills himself by ripping out his arm, using it to take out all of his brain, and ripping out his own body.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #2-3 (2008)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Leader made his first appearance in ''[[Ultimate Human]]'' #1, a miniseries starring [[Alternative versions of Iron Man#Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Iron Man]] and [[Ultimate Hulk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0712/18/marvelmarch.htm |title=Tuesday, December 18, 2007: Marvel Comics for March |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref> This Leader is also the Ultimate version of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[Pete Wisdom]]. In the Ultimate universe, Wisdom is an ex-British Intelligence agent thrown out of the organization after testing his "British Enhancile Program" on himself, transforming him into The Leader.<ref>''Ultimate Human'' #1 (January 2008)</ref> Wisdom has psychic and mental abilities similar to the original Leader, but requires a wheelchair and a [[halo (medicine)|halo]] brace to support the weight of his enlarged cranium. The Leader attempts to steal Tony Stark's nanotechnology as Banner and Stark work together to try to incorporate it into Banner's physiology in the hopes that it will grant him control over his transformations into the Hulk. When Stark commands a decoy Iron-Tech robot into the base of the Leader, Banner transforms into the Hulk. The Hulk resists the Leader's influence, and pounds him into the ground. The Leader, almost dead, commands a C-17 down onto the Hulk, ultimately killing Wisdom/Leader.<ref>''Ultimate Human'' #4</ref>

In ''[[Ultimate Mystery]]'' an elderly Dr. Samuel Sterns (who is seen in a wheelchair) is amongst a group of younger versions of Earth-616 villains and heroes including [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Arnim Zola]] III, [[Misty Knight]], [[Mister Sinister|Nathaniel Essex]], and Dr. [[Layla Miller]]. They represent a [[brain trust]] for [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Industries]].<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #3</ref> He is later transformed into a Hulk/Leader hybrid where he attacks [[Spider-Man]], but is defeated.<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #4</ref>
