==Fictional character biography==
Orka was originally an Atlantean soldier in the army of [[Krang (Marvel Comics)|Warlord Krang]], and aids the renegade Krang when he attempts to usurp the Atlantean throne from [[Namor]]. When this attempt fails, Orka goes into exile from [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] with Krang. Orka is then chosen to be the test subject of [[Lemuel Dorcas|Dr. Dorcas]], the marine scientist who created [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], one of Namor's arch foes. Courtesy of a belt with a psionic amplifier, Orka is given the power of a [[killer whale]], and aids Krang once more against Namor.<ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #23 (Mar. 1970).

==Powers and abilities==
Orka is an exceptionally strong Atlantean, who courtesy of Doctor Dorcas' enhancements Orka has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, and agility. Orka originally wore a belt which by psionic means provided the added power of a killer whale to the character's already considerable strength. The belt also allowed Orka to exist for indefinite periods on land although he was not at full strength due to [[dehydration]]. Using surgical and electrochemical enhancements, the Brand Corporation augmented Orka's natural abilities, which allowed him to retain his strength without the use of the belt. The experimentation also increased Orka's size, resilience and endurance, but at the cost of reduced intelligence. Orka can communicate with and summon killer whales through high-pitched whistles; so long as there are killers whales in his vicinity Orka's physical abilities increase several time over. He can also swim at superhuman speeds.
