Lee Guardineer is a [[Magic (illusion)|stage magician]] who used his stage acts to rob rich party guests. His activities attracted the attention of Giant-Man's ants who reported this. The Magician then robbed a yacht party run by the rich socialite Sterling Stuyvesant and kidnapped the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] to make Giant-Man jealous. In response, Giant-Man set up a phony [[yacht]] party which lured the Magician to a trap. Once that trap was sprung, Giant-Man captured the Magician and saved the Wasp. The Magician was fished out of the water by the police and later taken to prison.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #56. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While [[Hank Pym]] was out of town, the Magician escaped from prison and set up a clothing store with Wasp-inspired clothing. When the Wasp arrived, the Magician attacks in order to capture the Wasp. However, the Wasp soon makes short work of the Magician using quick thinking and the store's many toys to take down the Magician who is promptly arrested by the police.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #58. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sometime later, Lee was released from prison and moved to Tampa with a dancer named Chasity to start a new family where he had a son.<ref name="Astonishing Ant-Man #2">''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Lee Guardineer had an unnamed son who took up the Magician mantle as part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]" event. Upon taking his father's mantle, Magician joined the [[Power Broker]]'s Hench App (a mobile app that enabled people to solicit the service of supervillains). His first job has him hired by publicist Marlena Howard to pretend to have a grudge against [[Ms. Thing|Darla Deering]] for not hiring him for the opening act of the woman's show. The Magician interrupted Deering in the middle of her break-up fight against [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] and confronted the two heroes with genetically-modified rabbits and pigeons. After explaining his origin to Ant-Man, the Magician intentionally lost to Miss Thing. The fight between the Magician and Ant-Man and Darla was staged and filmed because it would make a successful pilot episode for Darla's newest reality show.<ref name="Astonishing Ant-Man #2"/>

==Powers and abilities==
The Lee Guardineer version of Magician is a skilled stage magician, trickster, and illusionist where his tricks rely on his technology. Besides being a master pickpocket, he is an expert animal trainer and can hypnotize anyone at will. The Magician has a motorized cane with a hatch on top that can act as a vacuum and be used as a divining rod to seek out his enemies.

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Magician is '''Elliot Boggs'''. His powers first emerged uncontrollably, apparently killing both of his parents. After being subdued by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], custody of him is given over to [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Marvel|Professor Charles Xavier]] in the hopes Elliot can control his powers. When Elliot awakes, he quickly urges [[Alternative versions of Cyclops#Ultimate Marvel|Cyclops]] to let him join the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]]. Shorthanded, Cyclops allows Elliot to help the X-Men take on the [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Ultimate Marvel|Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy]] attacking the 'Academy of Tomorrow. During the battle, Elliot manages to easily defeat the [[Blob (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Blob]]. Afterwards, he adopts the Magician code name, which is suggested by television reporters. Several of the X-Men observe that the reporters got there amazingly fast, as well as the fact that the Brotherhood had no reason for the initial attack in the first place. After Elliot's interview, the X-Men are on good terms with the press for the first time since [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Ultimate Marvel|Magneto]] [[Ultimate War|returned after an presumed death]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #71. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later during an attack by the [[Friends of Humanity]] on a hospital that gave treatments to mutants (despite there being no mutant patients at the time and in broad daylight), Elliot once again fights alongside the X-Men. It turns out the group's leader is actually a mutant incapacitating the rest of the X-Men leaving only Elliot standing. The young mutant single-handedly defeats the mutant leader. Before the X-Men returned to the mansion, [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] paid Xavier a visit, requesting that Elliot join the [[Ultimates]]. However, Xavier refuses to which Fury says Elliot's parents have agreed to their son joining the Ultimates. Xavier is shocked to hear about the boy's parents, as Xavier was told that Elliot had killed his parents. When Fury is unable to recall saying or doing this and only heard of Elliot when he started appearing with the X-Men, Charles realizes something is very wrong.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #72. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Charles and Nick believe that Elliot has been messing with their minds, creating the illusion of Nick bringing him to Charles. Fury states that even if Elliot had made everyone forget, there would still be a record on file at S.H.I.E.L.D. The two await Elliott's arrival to confront him. When the jet lands, Charles asks Elliot to "come clean". Xavier confronts him with the truth that his parents are not dead and that Fury never took him to the mansion. When everyone begins attacking him, Elliot tries to make everyone all stop and forget why they are attacking him but this tactic fails to work completely thanks to Charles' interference. Elliot decides he's through playing games and that he could have made the X-Men popular but now he has to kill everyone. However, Elliot is unaware of [[Alternative versions of Jean Grey#Ultimate Marvel|Jean Grey]]'s presence much to Elliot's surprise.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #73. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A battle ensues, in which Magician once again summons the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy out of thin air. Magician binds the X-Men in metal and Jean fights the entire Brotherhood alone. Jean speaks psychically to [[Wolverine (Ultimate Marvel character)|Wolverine]] and obtains permission to burn away the metal binding him. Wolverine acquiesces and attacks Magician with little or no skin left. As the battle progresses, Wolverine slowly heals, slicing Magician's throat and finally jamming claws through him, apparently making Magician (and all traces of his work) disappear. A conversation between Magician and [[Kitty Pryde]] later revealed that Magician simply wants to be left alone and wanted some closure to his story. It is revealed Kitty doesn't see or hear the Magician in any way. Magician states that he will now go somewhere that "there aren't any people, like [[Antarctica]] or something."<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #74. Marvel Comics.</ref>
