'''Kevin O'Brien''' was born in [[Chicago]]. He became an engineer and inventor working for the newly opened Lakani Island plant of [[Stark Industries]] who came to the attention of Tony Stark when he invented a stun-ray that managed to harmlessly disperse a crowd of violent protestors. Stark invited O'Brien to transfer to the main plant on [[Long Island]], and he accepted. Despite a careless streak that once caused the laboratory he was working in to explode, he became a close friend of Stark and was soon appointed head of Stark's research department.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

On several occasions, O'Brien assisted Stark and the supposed bodyguard Iron Man, notably against the [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] and the assistants the Espionage Elite, saving Stark's life on more than one occasion. Stark then decided to reveal to O'Brien being secretly Iron Man, and to build for him a second suit of armor for use in the event of an emergency. That emergency would come a short time later, when Iron Man and girlfriend Marianne Rogers were taken captive by the superhuman madman Mikas the Soulfather. Putting on the armor before being fully tested, O'Brien fell prey to a malfunction in the [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] circuitry controlling the armor which apparently stimulated the regions of the brain where rage and jealousy originate.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

O'Brien found himself seized with sudden attraction for Marianne and became extremely jealous of Stark's power, looks and fortune. At the same time, Simon Gilbert, then [[Chairman|Chairman of the Board]] of Stark Industries' stockholders, grew alarmed that Stark was moving out of munitions production and mapped strategies with the board to seize controlling interest in the firm from Stark as principal stockholder. Clad in armor and calling himself the "Guardsman", O'Brien offered to aid the board in their plot against Stark. As a show of support, he agreed to quell a protest rally outside the plant. The Guardsman aimed his repulsor rays at the crowd, injuring four protestors. Sickened by what he did, O'Brien turned on the renegade board members, physically assaulting them. However, seeing Stark with Marianne caused him to once again become unbalanced, and he went outside to vent his rage on the growing crowd of protestors. Stark donned the Iron Man armor and engaged the Guardsman in battle to prevent him from doing more damage. Losing, the Guardsman sought refuge in an experimental tank. In an attempt to stop him without hurting him, Iron Man's repulsor rays were trained on the vehicle and accidentally hit its fuel supply. The tank exploded, killing O'Brien.<ref>''Iron Man'' #43, 45–46</ref>

'''Michael O'Brien''' was also born in Chicago, Illinois. Some months after Kevin's death, when the details of the incident came to public light, Michael, a sergeant in the [[New York City Police Department]], decided that the official investigation exonerating Iron Man's actions was a [[cover-up]]. Reopening the investigation without official sanction, Detective O'Brien confronted Tony Stark, interrogated several employees, and declared his intention of proving Stark responsible for his brother's death.<ref>''Iron Man'' #82</ref>

O'Brien finally hired Harry Key, an unscrupulous [[private investigator]], to get him inside the Long Island plant. There O'Brien located the Guardsman armor and put it on, determined to use it to bring Iron Man to justice. However, the malfunction in the cybernetic circuitry that affected his brother's brain also affected Michael's brain, and he flew into a rage seeking to kill Iron Man. Iron Man confronted his attack and finally convinced him that the armor was causing him to act insanely. O'Brien collapsed on rebelling against his own urge to kill Iron Man. Stark took O'Brien into custody rather than press criminal charges, hoping to convince the man of his innocence in Kevin's death. While Stark worked on a new set of armor, the Japanese mutant [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] attacked the plant. Stark was unable to put on his new armor since it had not yet cooled, and unable to find any of his spare suits of armor since a saboteur had stolen them. Hence, he was forced to put on the Guardsman armor to fight off Sunfire. O'Brien witnessed Stark's heroic attempts to save lives over a video monitor, aware that Stark was risking a major heart attack by the strenuous activity. Escaping confinement, O'Brien decided he was wrong about Stark and determined to help him by donning the now-cooled Iron Man armor. Thus clad, he was mistaken for the real Iron Man and kidnapped by the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]. Stark discovered an old set of Iron Man armor that the saboteur had overlooked and went to China to rescue O'Brien. Upon rescuing him, Stark chose to reveal his true identity to O'Brien before he went off to battle the Mandarin. O'Brien flew back to New York where he took custody of the Guardsman armor once more.<ref>''Iron Man'' #96–100</ref>

After Iron Man defeated the Mandarin, Stark fixed the malfunction in the Guardsman armor's circuitry so it was safe to wear.{{Issue|date=February 2012}} Michael O'Brien was determined to use the armor to vindicate both his brother's and his own senseless actions. When Stark International was taken over by the criminal [[Midas (comics)#Mordecai Midas|Midas]], the Guardsman joined with a number of Stark's other friends and allies to battle Midas' men. He was turned to gold by Midas' power, but was later restored to flesh.<ref>''Iron Man'' #108</ref> Having quit the police force, O'Brien interviewed for the position of security director at [[Project Pegasus|Project: Pegasus]], the government energy research facility, after its previous director [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] quit. With a high recommendation by Stark, O'Brien got the job.<ref name="Avengers236">''Avengers'' #236</ref> Sometime later, while guarding the Project, O'Brien's Guardsman armor was damaged in a battle with the subhuman [[Subterranea (comics)#Lava Men|Lava Men]].<ref name="Avengers236" /> It was later repaired at the Project's expense. O'Brien, as the Guardsman, has been living and working full-time in the Project since his appointment and has performed his duties capably.{{Issue|date=February 2012}}

Later, he was the security chief at [[Hydro-Base|Avengers Island]].<ref>''Avengers'' #301</ref> He also participated in the Iron Legion against [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]], wearing a re-creation of the Silver Centurion armor.<ref>''Iron Man'' #300</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Both Guardsmen wore powered armor designed by Tony Stark and Stark Industries. The Guardsman armor contained a powered exoskeleton that gave the wearer superhuman strength allowing the operator to lift 40 tons under optimal conditions (for about 3 minutes). The armor's high-carbon steel alloy mesh and radiation shielding also offer protection from most ballistic and even energy weapons. The armor can fly via chemically powered boot jets at a maximum speed of {{convert|250|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} for 3 hours, and contains 30 minutes air supply for submersion or high-altitude flight.

Each palm of the Guardsman armor's gauntlets contains a charged ion "repulsor ray" emitter capable of 45 seconds continuous discharge at a range of {{convert|40|ft|m}} before irregularities in the plasma cone diffuse the beam.

Kevin O'Brien had earned a PhD in engineering, with expertise in engineering and was a gifted inventor. He also used a "stun-ray" device as a weapon.

Michael O'Brien is a good hand-to-hand combatant and was coached by [[Captain America]]. As a policeman, he carried a police issue handgun, and as Avengers security chief he used "stun guns" and other advanced weaponry.

Both Kevin and Michael suffered from emotional instability that was exacerbated by the cybernetic circuitry in the original Guardsman battle-suit, causing both men to go insane. Michael O'Brien was able to wear the Guardsman armor safely after psychologically coming to terms with his trauma over his brother's death. The armor circuitry has since been modified by Anthony Stark to prevent its causing such adverse effects.

The Guardsman armor was replicated by Stane International for use at the Vault, and retained similar abilities to the original version. When the original armors were destroyed by Iron Man during the Armor Wars, Stane International attempted to re-create the Guardsman armor without Stark's designs; however, they proved inferior to the Stark-based models. Stark Enterprises replaced the second-generation Stane models with an improved design from Anthony Stark.  Although superior to the Stane models, the new Stark Enterprises suits were limited to operation within the vicinity of the Vault, as a security measure to prevent misuse of their Iron Man-derived technology.

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Guardsmen appeared in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' animated series. In the episode "Armor Wars" [Pt. 2], [[Iron Man]] invaded the Vault to disable the Guardsman armors. After slipping sleeping gas into the Vault's ventilation systems that puts all its inmates to sleep, Iron Man ended up in a fight with the Guardsmen and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. Iron Man used the Negator Packs on them and discovered that they do not use the technology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
* Michael O'Brien appears in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'', voiced by [[Brian Drummond]].<ref>[http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/voice-compare/Iron-Man/Iron-Monger/ Behind the Voice Cast: ''Iron Man: Armored Adventures'']. Retrieved 2012-05-02.</ref> He is Stark International's security chief (i.e. the Guardsman's most mundane namesake) under [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]]'s personal command. Most of his appearances he does not wear a powered armor suit of his own, however, he gets to pilot the [[Crimson Dynamo]] armor,<ref>''Iron Man: Armored Adventures'', episode "Seeing Red"</ref> and later on the [[Iron Monger]] [[mecha|mech]] to tear down a derelict city block. But he refuses to finish Iron Man when the hero aids Dr. Abraham Zimmer (a resident of that area), and O'Brien is fired by Stane for his act of mercy.<ref>''Iron Man: Armored Adventures'', episode "Enter: The Iron Monger!"</ref> Meanwhile, the Guardsman is presented as the name for an armored duo of criminals ([[Force (comics)|Force]] using repainted Space Armor and [[Shockwave (comics)|Shockwave]] using repainted Stealth Armor) appearing as public heroes and commercial mascots on Stane's behalf. While they seem to appear just in time to prevent disastrous incidents, [[Pepper Potts]] eventually shows Iron Man evidence revealing that the Guardsmen had in fact caused these incidents and that they are notorious criminals. At the Guardsmen Expo where [[Firepower (comics)|Firepower]] (using repainted [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster armor]]) is unveiled as the latest member of the Guardsmen, Pepper forces the Guardsmen to reveal their identities upon hacking the Expo's television screen to show their mug shots as [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] enforcers. After the Guardsmen are defeated by Iron Man and [[War Machine]], Obadiah escapes suspicion by claiming on television that he had no knowledge of the criminal past of the Guardsmen members.
