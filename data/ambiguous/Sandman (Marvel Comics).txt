==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}

The Sandman first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #4 (Sept. 1963), created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] as an adversary of [[Spider-Man]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 20|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= In this installment, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko introduced Sandman – a super villain who could turn his entire body into sand with a single thought.}}</ref><ref name="Sandman">{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 20|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= In this installment, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko introduced Sandman - a super villain who could turn his entire body into sand with a single thought.}}</ref><ref name="Issue #4">{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Ditko, Steve|story= Nothing Can Stop...The Sandman!|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= 4|date= September 1963}}</ref> The character returned in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #18 and #19, and was soon depicted in other comics, such as ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]''.

The Sandman served as the villain of the first issue of the Spider-Man spin-off series ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (March 1972), which gave him a more morally ambiguous depiction.

The Sandman was later an ally of Spider-Man, as well as a reserve member of the Avengers and a member of Silver Sable's "[[Wild Pack]]" team of mercenaries.

Besides being most notable as a Spider-Man supervillain, he has also been depicted as a [[Fantastic Four]] [[List of Fantastic Four enemies|antagonist]] in Stan Lee and [[Jack Kirby]] comic books (mostly due to being introduced as a founding member of the original [[Frightful Four]]<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker=[[Chic Stone|Stone, Chic]]|story= The Attack of the Evil Frightful Four|title= [[Fantastic Four]]|issue=#36 |date= March 1965}}</ref>) along with being on the heroic side (being an [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[List of Avengers members|reserve member]]<ref name="casebook99">{{Cite comic | writer = Marc Steven Sumerak | penciller = Eric Eng Wong | inker = John G.

==Fictional character biography==
William Baker was born in [[Queens]], New York. When he was three years old, his father abandoned him and his mother. In these early years, she took her son to [[Coney Island]] beach. He lost himself happily in sand sculptures, a craft he would use in secondary school under the encouragement of his teacher (and first crush), Miss Flint.<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1">[[Peter David|David, Peter]]; ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual'' #1 (July 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>

In preparatory school, a boy named Vic bullied Baker until he learned to fight using an opponents' motions against themselves, a technique he performed as if he "slipped through their fingers like sand". Vic and his buddies eventually befriended Baker. In high school, William played on his school's football team, using the sport to channel his anger. While playing football he adopted the nickname "Flint", after his former teacher.<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1"/>

After Vic incurs a large gambling debt to a [[gangster|mobster]], he begs Flint to fix a football game he bet on to pay off his debt. Flint does, but is kicked off the team after the coach discovers his involvement. The coach taunts Baker, telling him that he will accomplish nothing of importance in his life. Flint hits his ex-coach, resulting in his expulsion from school and the beginning of his life of crime.

His illegal activity increases in depth and scope, turning him into a violent, bitter man. Eventually he ends up in prison on Ryker's Island where he meets his father, Floyd Baker. He is friendly to his father but does not tell him who he is. He tells Floyd his nickname, Flint, and a false surname, Marko, inspired by his former coach's taunts about not "making a mark" on the world. He uses the alias Flint Marko from that point on<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1"/> (he changed his name also to prevent his mother from discovering he is a criminal).<ref>[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]]; ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #86 (April 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> After Floyd is released from prison, Marko escapes.<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1"/>

Marko flees to a [[nuclear testing]] site on a beach near [[Savannah, Georgia]] where he comes into contact with sand that had been [[radiation|irradiated]] by an experimental reactor. His body and the radioactive sand [[chemical bond|bond]], changing Marko's [[molecule|molecular]] structure into sand. Impressed, he calls himself the Sandman after his new powers.

Marko clashes with Peter Parker/[[Spider-Man]] for the first time in Peter's high school. Spider-Man defeats Marko with a vacuum cleaner and hands it over to the police.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Sandman escapes by getting through his window after turning himself to sand, but is recaptured by the Human Torch after the Torch lures the Sandman to a building by disguising himself as Spider-Man, then activating the sprinkler systems. After this Marko resurfaces as a member of the [[Sinister Six]], led by [[Doctor Octopus]]. He battles Spider-Man inside an airtight metal box, which is activated when Spider-Man touches a card saying where the Vulture is, but the Sandman is defeated due to Spider-Man having stronger [[human lung|lungs]] than he does.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Alongside the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], he captures the [[Human Torch]] but later succumbs to Spider-Man and the Human Torch.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #18–19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Spider-Man defeats Flint numerous times, Flint diverts his attention to other superheroes. He teams with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], [[Trapster|Paste Pot Pete]] (later known as the Trapster) and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] to form the [[Frightful Four]] to combat the [[Fantastic Four]], which attacks during Reed and Sue's engagement party. The Fantastic Four, with the help of a few other superheroes, defeat the group.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref> In another battle, in which he teams up with [[Blastaar]] and loses against the Four, he dons a diamond-patterned green costume designed by Wizard.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #62–63. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he and [[Hulk]] dueled for the first time.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #113. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] joins him in his next conflict against the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #114. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In time Sandman discovers—-starting with his hands—-that his body can transform into glass and back again. He contracts cancer and takes over a medical research center, battling the Hulk again.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #138. Marvel Comics.</ref> He battles [[Wonder Man]] but is cured of his cancer by radiation.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Afterward, he allies himself with [[Hydro-Man]] to battle their mutual enemy, Spider-Man. An accident merges the two villains into a monster called Mud-Thing. Spider-Man and the police are able to dehydrate the monstrosity.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #217–218. Marvel Comics.</ref> Months later, the supervillains manage to separate themselves and go their separate ways.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}

The time trapped with Hydro-Man caused Marko to question his bad life choices. The [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], after an aborted attempt to fight Baker, urges him to straighten himself out and use his ability to do good.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #86. Marvel Comics.</ref> The story continues when he meets with the Thing for a second time to see a sports game.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #24 (back story) 1990, page 44. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Marko boards with the Cassadas and teams with Spider-Man against the Enforcers.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #138. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sandman then makes sporadic appearances in Spider-Man comics assisting his former enemy. His first appearance has him coming to the rescue of Spider-Man and [[Silver Sable]], who are outnumbered and surrounded by the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. Silver Sable is impressed by Sandman's performance and recruits him as a freelance operative.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #280–281. Marvel Comics.</ref> Doctor Octopus coerces him to rejoin Sinister Six, but Marko turns against them. Doctor Octopus turns him into glass for his treason. Spider-Man, however, saved the Sandman.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #334, 338–339. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sandman also appears as part of [[The Outlaws (comics)|The Outlaws]], a group of reformed Spider-Man enemies, such as [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]], [[Rocket Racer]], [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] and [[Will o' the Wisp (comics)|Will o' the Wisp]], that on occasion that would aid Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #169. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later he receives a presidential pardon and briefly joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as a reserve member.<ref>''Avengers'' #329. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he becomes a full-time [[mercenary]] in the employ of [[Silver Sable]], as a member of her [[Wild Pack]], serving alongside heroes such as [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] and [[Battlestar (comics)|Battlestar]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Sandman is one of the few heroes temporarily overwhelmed by their evil doubles during the [[The Infinity War|Infinity War]]. This double almost kills them all.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Marko turns against Spider-Man and his sometimes ally Thing and declares his allegiance to evil and his former employer, the Wizard. This change proved incompatible to what many fans had thought Sandman had become, a hero.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> This outcry caused Marvel to rush out a story which retconned ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #4 in which the Wizard had kidnapped Sandman and used his mind control machine, the Id Machine, to turn him back into a villain.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The machine worked too well and Sandman went about reforming the Sinister Six to destroy both Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus, only to be double-crossed by [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], who Sandman recruited as the sixth member of the team. During Venom's brawl against Sandman, the vicious black symbiote's mouth rips a chunk of sand from Sandman. That missing sand destabilizes Sandman, causing him to lose his ability to maintain his human form. Before falling into the sewer (and as a nod to fans who rejected Marvel's attempt to re-villainize the character), Sandman admitted that part of the reason for his fall from grace was the trouble he had to really cope with life on the good guys' side, and asks Spider-Man to tell his mother he was sorry he did not fulfill his promise to her, to be a force for good. Sandman washes away and slides down a sewer, from which he mixes into [[Jones Beach, New York]]<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #22</ref> and is thought dead.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Sandman's body and mind are scattered throughout the beach. This separation lasts too long for him, causing his mind to split into good and its opposite, evil, which when dominant created sand vortexes to ensnare beach combers. Spider-Man arrived to confront Sandman, ultimately using Sandman's mental instability to free his captives and cause him to explode.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

His sand wafts throughout New York and touches down into piles forming beings that personify him: the good, the bad, the gentle and the innocent. Spider-Man locates these Sandmen to convince them to unify. Sandman's evil persona merges with his innocent and gentle personas, but Sandman's good persona rebuffs the evil one. Because Sandman's mind can handle his personality in separation for only a limited time, he loses his ability to retain himself, crumbling and blowing away, leaving Spider-Man to ponder the nature of his scuddled foe.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #56–57. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sandman is one of the villains recruited to recover the [[Identity Disc]], but during its recovery seemingly he is killed in a mutiny. At the series' end Sandman is found alive and working with Vulture to manipulate the other villains.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

In the storyline "Sandblasted", in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #17–19 (April–June 2007), Sandman asks Spider-Man to help him redeem his father, who has been charged with and imprisoned for murdering a [[homeless]] man. He admits his father was a petty criminal but insists he would not commit murder. Baker also said the victim resembles Peter Parker's [[Uncle Ben]], who had been murdered years before then. Sandman and Spider-Man find the killer, [[Chameleon (comics)#Chameleon 2211|Chameleon 2211]]. Chameleon 2211 kills Uncle Ben who [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Hobgoblin 2211|Hobgoblin 2211]] brought from an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #8</ref> and had been posing as him after that. Thanks to Spider-Man, Floyd Baker is switched with Chameleon 2211 and saved, for which Sandman thanks Spider-Man.

Sandman returned in "[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|Spider-Man: The Gauntlet]]" storyline, which redefined the character and his powers/mental state. While investigating a series of murders and a missing girl named Keemia Alvarado, whose mother is a victim of those murders, Spider-Man traces the murders and the abduction to the Sandman, the girl's father, who is hiding on Governor's Island with Keemia. Sandman's powers have evolved to where he can create duplicates of himself who have their own personalities and, to Baker's shock, claim they committed the murders.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #615. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man sneaks away and uses a fan to obliterate the Sandmen. Originally Spider-Man believed Keemia would be handed to her grandmother, but instead she was sent to a foster home by [[Child Protective Services]]. [[Carlie Cooper]] is exonerated upon being under police suspicion for tampering with the murder evidences, but Sandman is at large.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #616. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Origin of the Species" storyline, Sandman is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his villains' team where he becomes involved in a plot to receive a reward and securing some specific items for him. Sandman went after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant, believing that Doctor Octopus would reward him by reuniting him with Keemia. He ended up being accidentally struck with lightning by Electro, temporarily turning him into [[fulgurite]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #643. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man goes on a rampage against all the villains after the Chameleon stole the infant and tricked him into believing it had died. At the dock, Sandman along with Shocker and the Enforcers are hiding. However, Spider-Man collapses the floor of the building which falls into the water. Sandman attempts to rise to attack, but Spider-Man shoots him using Shocker's vibrational air-blasts.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]'', he is part of the new Sinister Six along with Mysterio, Rhino, Doctor Octopus, Chameleon and Electro. He rises up against Doctor Octopus' plan to detonate New York, saying Keemia is still there.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is later angered when, during a confrontation between the Sinister Six and the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]], Doctor Octopus teleports the Wizard into the upper atmosphere using the Intelligencia's equipment. Sandman was talking with his former Frightful Four teammate and old friend at the time. When [[Mad Thinker]] goes after Electro, Sandman violently attacks him claiming that he did not want to lose any more friends.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #667. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Doctor Octopus [[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|puts his plan into action]], Sandman is satisfied with the job because of the planned two billion dollar "compensation fee", which he reasons will help him gain custody of Keemia. However, although sent to guard a facility in the Sahara Desert giving him complete control of the largest body of sand in the world, he is defeated by Spider-Man, [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Silver Sable]] when Spider-Man identifies and isolates the one grain of sand that contains his conscious mind.<ref name="asm684">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #684</ref> Spider-Man and Silver Sable then violently interrogate Sandman to reveal all of Doctor Octopus' secrets to them.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #685. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Dying Wish]]" storyline, Sandman's captive form is later stolen from the Baxter Building by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body) where he takes him to his underwater lab.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sandman, Chameleon, Electro, [[Mysterio#Mysterion|Mysterion]], and the Vulture are later seen as part of a team led by Superior Spider-Man called the "Superior Six". Superior Spider-Man has been temporarily controlling their minds in order to redeem them for their crimes. He does this by forcing them do heroic deeds against their will, some of which almost get some of them killed. Every time he is done controlling them, he puts them back in their containment cells.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> They eventually break free of Superior Spider-Man's control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, while nearly destroying New York in order to do so.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the help of Sun Girl, Superior Spider-Man is barely able to stop the Superior Six.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7. Marvel Comics./ref>

Inspired by the heroism of the villains who had their moralities inverted by the events of "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]," Sandman rejoins one of his old gangs and breaks into Ryker's Island in search of the group's leader Dixon. Upon reaching Dixon's cell, Sandman turns on and incapacitates him and his followers. He then leaves with Dixon's cellmate, a "good egg" who Sandman had deemed deserving of a second chance.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Frank Barbiere|penciller = Victor Santos|inker = Victor Santos|colorist = Lauren Affe|letterer = VC's Travis Lanham|editor = Jake Thomas and Daniel Ketchum|story = AXIS: Revolutions|title = Castles in the Sand|volume = 1|issue = #3|date = December 3, 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

During the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, Sandman is among the villains at [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s viewing party of the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sandman later appears as a member of the Sinister Six led by [[Prowler (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Aaron Davis]] in a recolored [[Iron Spider]] armor. He accompanied the Sinister Six in a plot to steal a decommissioned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #234. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Infinity Wars]]" storyline, Sandman is among the villains that accompany [[Turk Barrett]] to his meeting with the [[Infinity Watch]] at Central Park.<ref>''Infinity Wars'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sandman later discovered that he is starting to lose the consistency of his body. When Mad Thinker and Wizard are unable to find a solution to counter this and Sandman is hospitalized after collapsing, he is visited by Spider-Man who took him to the beach that Sandman visited in his childhood and stayed with him until his body broke down. After that happened, Spider-Man discovered that Sandman didin't die and that he lost the ability to assume a human shape where he now sports a blob-shaped body. When Sandman's body is taken over by a future version of Sandman from Earth-51838 where the sun went out, Spider-Man received some of Sandman's powers and used them to defeat Sandman of Earth-51838 and sends him back to his reality using the Multisect and assistance from Human Torch. After bidding farewell to Spider-Man, Sandman left to get adjusted to his new form while having developed a fear of his newly-discovered immortality.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #308-309. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Sandman has the ability to transform his body. He can will his body hardened, compacted, dispersed or shaped, or a combination of those qualities, an Earth manipulation of sand and rock particles. More often than not in combat, this ability enables him to absorb most blows with little to no ill effect other than reforming himself, a relatively fast action. His striped shirt and cargo pants are colored sand to make him appear as if he wears clothes. Even when soaked, he was able to stretch his sand molecules, growing to double his size.

Sandman can mold his arms and hands into shapes such as a [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] or a [[sledgehammer]] to battle Spider-Man and his other enemies. His mass, strength and shape shifting ability correspond to the number of sand and rock particles that comprise him. The more he incorporates (nearby) sand grains and rock granules into his body, the more those qualities are enhanced. Even though he controls every particle in his body, his mind exists in the astral plane. He can turn himself into a [[Dust storm|sandstorm]], which enables him to fly great distances and to suffocate his enemies.

His body takes on sand's chemical qualities, impervious to many, but not all, elements. Once, cement's ingredients were mixed into Sandman. That mixture turned him into cement that dried, rendering him immobile.<ref>''Nova'' #11–12. Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite this frailty he remained alive, but in a comalike state for a while before he returned to normal.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} In addition to his superb endurance, the Sandman possesses superhuman strength several times more than Spider-Man's and on par with the Thing's.

In a story with the Wizard, the Wizard fashioned Sandman a green suit with a belt that contained three buttons that allowed various chemicals to mix into the Sandman's body to enable him to change himself into consistencies related to sand. The suit, like Sandman's usual "clothes", changed into sand with him.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} Eventually, with the disbanding of the original Frightful Four, Sandman stopped using the suit.{{issue|date=April 2012}}

Temperature does alter the Sandman. At 3,400 degrees Fahrenheit his body turns into glass, also a form he can control. Unlike Sandman's fast transformation from sand to glass, his transformation from glass to sand takes time.<ref>[[Erik Larsen|Larsen, Erik]]; ''Spider-Man'' #18–23 (Jan.-June 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Although he is invulnerable to most physical attacks, even projectiles because they pass through him, water is a different story. There are some exceptions, for example while fighting [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], the villain's powerful mouth ripped cleanly and swiftly into Sandman. The amount of sand removed abruptly, and perhaps because of Venom's poisons, left the [[mass]] of Sandman in contortion, crippled beyond immediate repair. Sandman began to disintegrate, then flowed down a drain, and then washed up onto and into a beach.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #22 (Oct. 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref>

It has been revealed that, while Sandman can absorb and lose sand, his body must retain one key particle of sand that contains his conscious mind, allowing Spider-Man to defeat him by isolating that one grain from the rest of the Sandman (although the difficulty involved in setting up these events in the first place makes it impractical to use regularly).<ref name="asm684"/>

==Other characters named Sandman==
There had been some other characters in Marvel Comics that had been named "Sandman":

* In ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'', the Sandman that appears is the [[Sandman]] of legend. He lives in the Land of Dreams which is located in the Realm of Fairies within the potentially imaginary world of Nowhere. Sandman ruled over the realm and would place a blanket over it every day. Those who grabbed a dream from the dream tree would have a dream based on whatever they grabbed from the tree and awaken again when the Sandman removed the blanket over his land. Anyone who didn't grab a dream will end up in an eternal dreamless sleep.<ref>''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #41. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* In ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', an alien Sandman crash-landed on Earth where he ended up in Mexico. The local tribespeople thought it was an evil spirit. They took him while he was still weak from his crash and sealed him in a cave with no air and light where he remained in a state of suspended animation. By the early 1960s, a vacationing Marine named Steve Bronson and his family accidentally unleashed the alien Sandman on the world. The alien Sandman regained its consciousness and recounted its past to the Bronson family and planned to conquer the Earth. Steve Bronson tried to oppose the alien Sandman, but it proved invulnerable to physical assault. The alien Sandman ordered the Bronsons to transport him to North America, so he could observe the most powerful nation on the planet before putting his plan into action. Steve Bronson was able to alert the military to the alien Sandman's presence, but they also proved ineffective in dealing with the extraterrestrial threat. Bullets went right through him, gas was ineffectual because he does not breathe and while bombs would scatter his pieces, he proved capable of reforming himself afterwards. The alien Sandman planned to increase its size by absorbing every sand on the beaches until nothing can stop him. Steve Bronson's son Bobby heard about the plan and headed to the beach with a plan of his own. Bobby threw a pile of water over the sand which made the alien Sandman soggy to the point where he couldn't move. The military quickly transported the alien Sandman's body to a top-secret underground facility where he has remained ever since.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #70. Marvel Comics.</ref>
* There was an android called Sandman who was created by [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] and [[Mad Thinker]] to fight the Fantastic Four.

===1602===
''[[Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four]]'', a sequel to [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' written by [[Peter David]], features the 1602 version of the Marvel Sandman. While he physically resembles Flint Marko, he has the pale skin and glowing eyes of Gaiman's [[Dream (DC Comics)|Morpheus]]. He also alludes to an ability to summon nightmares. In the fourth issue he is able to send Ben Grimm to sleep by blowing a vapor or dust at him. Both the Sandman and Trapster are crushed by falling debris when Bensaylum collapses.<ref>''Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four'' #1–5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The other five members are violently killed by the zombie Spider-Man and Sandman flees, later encountering and killing his own reality's Spider-Man out of fear by forcing his own sand body mass down Spider-Man's throat and causing his stomach to bloat to massive proportions before violently exploding out of his chest. He is also disappointed by the seeming betrayal of his enemy, thinking that if Spider-Man is now willing to kill, then Sandman will also kill. Decades later, Sandman is infused with a nanite cure developed by Tony Stark and the Zombie Spider-Man that incorporates Wolverine's healing factor, which allows him to safely confront the Zombies. Working with a few allies that oppose the murderous zombies, the Sandman springs his trap. All zombies fall, destroyed from within. Upon his final death, Zombie Spider-Man thanks Sandman for avenging Aunt May and Mary Jane, to which Sandman replies, "Good riddance, ya disgusting freak."

Marko uses this opportunity to escape and wreak havoc in [[New Jersey]]. S.H.I.E.L.D., with the help of Spider-Man, contains him and imprisons him in a S.H.I.E.L.D holding facility.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

There, he meets fellow genetically altered criminals Norman Osborn ([[Green Goblin]]), Dr. Otto Octavius ([[Doctor Octopus]]), Max Dillon ([[Ultimate Electro|Electro]]) and [[Kraven the Hunter]].

* Sandman appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=860|title=Marvel Animation Age – The Marvel Animation News Resource|website=marvel.toonzone.net}}</ref> voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In season one's "Snow Day", Spider-Man and the [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees]] encounter Flint Marko on an island that [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]] finds to use as a vacation spot. He first appears to the team in the form of the young boy Sandy (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}) wanting to play with Spider-Man's team. Spider-Man's team finds Sandy's "brother" who claims that Sandy always playing in the ruins (which suddenly forms). When Spider-Man's team goes on a tactical retreat, Sandy turns into sand and moves their [[Quinjet]] to the top of the ruins daring them to come get it. Spider-Man's team end up attacked by Sandy and Flint who then forms a sand labyrinth for them to maneuver around. [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] finds hieroglyphics where it said that Sandman escaped from prison and was caught in an explosion that gave him his powers. The hieroglyphics state that [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] dropped Sandman on the island. Flint and Sandy combine into one which Spider-Man's team fights. Spider-Man fights Sandman while the others try to get to the Quinjet. Nova lifts the Quinjet as Spider-Man's team flies away until they are intercepted by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents; Fury reveals at this point that S.H.I.E.L.D. dropped Sandman on an island because no prison could successfully contain him. It is then shown that Sandman had stowed away in Spider-Man's outfit as he forms in the Quinjet and freezes the controls. Upon landing in the frozen Hudson River, Spider-Man's team had to stop Sandman before he reaches land. [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] cracks the ice and Spider-Man tells Nova to heat Sandman's body enough to turn him to glass. Sandman was then placed in a special containment unit (which resembles an hourglass that is always moving) that would keep him from reassembling. Spider-Man notes that Sandman's isolation on the island likely affected his sanity, which Fury referring the situation to the equivalent of 'sweeping [Sandman] under the rug'. In season two's "Sandman Returns", Sandman is accidentally freed by [[Awesome Android]] and ends up stopping Awesome Android and putting out the fire Awesome Android caused. Sandman stated to Spider-Man that he just wanted to help. Fury mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. has been working to rehabilitate Sandman and hoping to make him a hero. Spider-Man has Fury let Sandman be trained to be a hero. Sandman is outfitted into a special containment suit (which resembles the suit that the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] made for him in the comics) that limits his power by Walter Cage and Amanda Cage. As S.H.I.E.L.D. observe Sandman's program, Spider-Man takes Sandman to battle [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]] where Sandman's containment suit is targeted by Swarm. Spider-Man is forced to get the containment suit off of Sandman, pummeling Swarm into submission. Sandman is brought into control and apologizes for his actions. With advice from Iron Fist, Spider-Man trains Sandman (equipped with a replacement containment suit) into being a man first and Sandman second. When [[Batroc the Leaper]] is in the middle of a robbery, Sandman springs into action, attacking Batroc. When Batroc throws a garbage at Sandman, he ends up attacking Batroc as [[J. Jonah Jameson]] makes a bad comment towards Sandman. Sandman loses control of his emotions and breaks out of his suit, attacking Spider-Man with a sandstorm attack. Fury sends the rest of Spider-Man's team to help Spider-Man stop Sandman. Spider-Man denies Nova's plan to turn Sandman into glass again as Spider-Man has a different plan. Spider-Man then tries to reason with Sandman until Nova arrives and Spider-Man throws Awesome Android into Sandman's mouth where Awesome Android absorbs Sandman. When S.H.I.E.L.D. agents arrive with a new containment suit, Sandman is shot into the containment suit and taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. He can be seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors''. In the finale "Contest of Champions" [Part 2], the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] uses Sandman's monstrous form against Spider-Man in a game of 'Capture the Flag'. Spider-Man tries to reason with Sandman that he's not a villain to which Sandman stated that S.H.I.E.L.D. has always keeping him locked up. The [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] places Captain America, [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] and Iron Fist into the game. With an idea from Spider-Man, Red Hulk was able to heat himself up enough to turn Sandman into glass, removing him from the game. Sandman has occasional appearances in ''Ultimate Spider-Man vs The Sinister Six''. In the episode "Beached", Sandman is captured and cloned from his sand samples by Doctor Octopus in order to find the 'Ultimate Sandman' via remote control that would join the [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]-backed Sinister Six. A pursuit of the Vulture takes Spider-Man and Iron Spider to a nearby island the two young heroes fight off the splinter Sandmen. Iron Spider stumbling onto Doc Ock's lab results in being imprisoned by Doc Ock as one of Sandman's clones wears the Iron Spider armor to fight Spider-Man. As [[Amadeus Cho]] and Sandman work to get free, Spider-Man fights Doc Ock, some Octobots, and the Sandman clones. Upon Spider-Man and Amadeus using an electronical disruption to deactivate Doc Ock's remote, the Sandman Clones are rendered inert as Sandman reabsorbs them. After Doc Ock gets away, Spider-Man and Iron Spider allow Sandman to assume his sand form in an area near the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], telling him that he will be given a chance to join the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy whenever he is ready. In the episode "The New Sinister 6" [Part 2], Spider-Man asks Sandman to fight [[Hydro-Man]] while the web-slinger goes after Doc Ock. Both Sandman and Hydro-Man were easily matched. After Octopus Island's destruction, Sandman caught the escape pod that Spider-Man and Aunt May were in and then proceeded to defeat Hydro-Man. In the episode "Agent Web", Sandman was seen at the Triskelion taking part in the beach activities with the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy cadets.
* Sandman appears in his self-titled ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/news/869243-marvels-animated-spider-man-voice-cast-and-premiere-date|title=Marvel's Animated Spider-Man Voice Cast and Premiere Date|date=July 14, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> episode voiced by [[Travis Willingham]]. This version is a former minion of Hammerhead and has a daughter named Keemia. After he had failed Hammerhead for the last time, Flint Marko was buried in a combination of sand and toxic waste. While Hammerhead thought he was dead, Flint actually survived and was mutated to have a sand-like body. During his rampage on Coney Island, Sandman ran afoul of Spider-Man and was hit with water from a dunk tank by Flash Thompson. Peter Parker gained its sample and studied it to find why it was sentient while using static electricity on it. When Sandman attacked the house, Spider-Man fought Sandman until he released the sand sample upon getting far from Aunt May's house. Upon hearing Sandman's origin upon getting control of his abilities, they head to Hammerhead's mansion to find Keemia only to find that she was mutated from the same accident and had better control of her abilities. Upon Keemia defeating Sandman, the V-252 on Spider-Man acted up and formed a black suit on him where he fought her and Hammerhead's minions. While Keemia disappeared into the night, Spider-Man webbed up Hammerhead and his minions and left them for the police while Sandman's fate is unknown.

===Film===
* [[Thomas Haden Church]] played Flint Marko / Sandman in the 2007 feature film ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. In the film, Sandman's origins are similar to the comics except for his connection to Spider-Man's origin. Flint Marko steals to pay for medical treatment for his [[Intensive care medicine|critically ill]] daughter, Penny. While on the run from the police after escaping from prison, he accidentally falls into an experimental [[particle accelerator]] that molecularly binds him with sand, giving him [[shapeshifting]] sand abilities and transforming him into the Sandman. A major focus of the plot involves Marko's connection to the death of [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] ([[Cliff Robertson]]), Spider-Man's uncle, in [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|the first film]]. Sandman is later spotted by police officers walking down the streets of [[Manhattan]]. Sandman gets on top of a dump truck filled with huge amounts of sand. At the police station, police captain [[George Stacy]] ([[James Cromwell]]) discovers evidence Marko is [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]]'s killer. He tells Peter and [[Aunt May]] ([[Rosemary Harris]]) that the carjacker [[Burglar (comics)|Dennis Carradine]] (whom Peter confronted three years earlier) was Marko's accomplice. A vengeful Spider-Man, wearing the black suit that would eventually become [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], attacked and seemingly killed Marko but he survived and later joined forces with [[Eddie Brock]] (who became Venom after Spider-Man rejects the black suit) to eliminate Spider-Man. He is ultimately defeated by [[Harry Osborn]], and upon learning Spider-Man's true identity after witnessing the destruction of Venom, he talks with Peter at the conclusion of the film, revealing the truth about Uncle Ben's death. Flint only wanted the car from Ben, who complied and calmly talked to Flint about why he was doing what he was. Flint began to reconsider his choices, when Carradine arrived and startled Flint, causing him to accidentally fire his gun, killing Ben. Flint was shocked and regretful, and remained behind while Carradine drove away in Ben's car before getting in a run with the police. Flint stated this because he wanted Peter to understand and that his love for his daughter Penny is the only thing he has left for himself. Understanding the importance of forgiveness over vengeance, Peter forgives him. Flint, having accepted Peter's forgiveness, turns into sand and peacefully blows away.
