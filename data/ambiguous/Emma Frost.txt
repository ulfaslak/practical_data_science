'''Emma Grace Frost''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], most commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #129 (January [[1980 in comics|1980]]), and was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Emma Frost, also known as the '''White Queen''', has evolved from a [[supervillain]] and foe of the X-Men, to becoming a [[superhero]] and one of the X-Men's most central members and leaders until the events of ''[[Inhumans vs. X-Men]]''.

Frost belongs to a subspecies of humanity called [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s, who are born with superhuman abilities. She is an urbane [[Telepathy|telepath]] with a well-noted, [[Deadpan|dry]] [[wit]].

The character appears in many adaptations of the X-Men properties, such as video games, animated programs, and [[X-Men (film series)|live-action films]].

==Publication history==
From her initial appearance as the White Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], Frost appeared as an X-Men villain over the years. Emma Frost first appeared in the famous storyline "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]", in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #129 (January [[1980 in comics|1980]]). The character was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Claremont was inspired to create the Hellfire Club after seeing the episode "[[A Touch of Brimstone]]" from the television show ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'',<ref name=xcompanion2>''X-Men Companion II''. 1982. Fantagraphics Books.</ref> where spy duo [[John Steed]] and [[Emma Peel]] infiltrate a criminal, hedonistic, underground society. Emma Frost was specifically inspired by Emma Peel, played by actress [[Diana Rigg]], who famously dons a provocative corset, collar, and boots and becomes the "Queen of Sin".<ref name="Knight2010">{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Gladys L.|title=Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video Games, Film, and Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PKSFHwhTGYC&pg=PA119|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=8 June 2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37612-2|page=119}}</ref>

After The Dark Phoenix saga, Emma Frost frequently appeared in other storylines in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' and the original volume of the ''[[New Mutants]]'' alongside her [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]].

In March 1986, [[Tom DeFalco]], Mary Wilshire, and [[Steve Leialoha]] were the creative team for the four issue ''[[Firestar (limited series)|Firestar]]'' miniseries, where Emma predominantly appeared alongside her Hellions. This series showcased Frost as the main villain as she attempted to turn [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Angelica Jones]] into her own personal weapon.

After recovering from a coma and aiming to redeem herself upon the knowledge that her Hellions had been slaughtered, Frost played a pivotal role in the [[Phalanx Covenant]], which saw her team up with [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] in an attempt to save the next generation of mutants. This led to her becoming a main character of the spin-off series ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' which began in November 1994 under the creative eyes of [[Scott Lobdell]], [[Chris Bachalo]], and [[Mark Buckingham]]. The series ended after over 75 issues (and several one-shots and miniseries) with [[Brian Wood (illustrator)|Brian Wood]], [[Ron Lim]], Sandu Florea, and Randy Elliott ending the series. The series offered glimpses into her past before her days in the Hellfire Club, as well as introducing her sisters [[Adrienne Frost|Adrienne]] and [[Cordelia Frost|Cordelia]].

After the series ended and all the X-Titles were revamped, in 2001 Frost appeared in ''New X-Men'' as a teacher for the mutant population of [[Genosha]], which was then controlled by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. After a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] strike leveled the island nation, the X-Men found Frost amidst the rubble with a "[[secondary mutation]]" which hardened her skin to a [[diamond]]-like density. Using Frost as a character was suggested to writer Grant Morrison on his website by a fan. While Morrison initially had no plans to use her, the death of the character Colossus left Morrison with an opening.<ref>{{cite web | first=Brian | last=Cronin | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/01/31/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-140/ | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #140 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=January 31, 2008 | accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref> He created Emma's secondary mutation – a super strong diamond form – as a replacement for Colossus' powers and added her to the cast.<ref>{{cite web | first=Brian | last=Cronin | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/01/17/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-138/ | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #138 | work=Comic Book Resources | date=January 17, 2008 | accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref> Subsequently, Frost joined the X-Men. This would lead to her instigating an affair with fellow X-Man [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], who was having marital difficulties with [[Jean Grey]]. This series also provided further glimpses into her past, introducing her father Winston Frost and her brother Christian.

In August 2003, writer Karl Bollers penned an [[ongoing series]] showcasing her origins titled ''Emma Frost''. The series, which lasted for 18 issues, began during her days as a private school student and ended before her days as a Hellfire Club member. It expanded on the role of her father Winston and her brother Christian, also exploring the early days of her two sisters. Later Marvel issues would expand Emma's character history by depicting her as having past romantic histories with prominent Marvel characters, such as [[Iron Man]] and Prince [[Namor]].<ref name="CW3">''Civil War'' #3</ref><ref name="UXM AN DR">''Uncanny X-Men Annual – Dark Reign'' #2 (March 2009)</ref>

Under [[Joss Whedon]] and [[John Cassaday]], Emma was featured in the third volume of ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]''. She was a major character in the ongoing series, specifically during its third arc, "Torn," in which the authenticity of her allegiance to the X-Men was explored. She also frequently made guest appearances in other Marvel titles, ''[[New X-Men]]'' in particular. The reduced presence of X-Men founder and former headmaster [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] in recent years has intensified her importance as one of Marvel's foremost telepaths.

===Background explored===
In a flashback story told by Frost in ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] #24'', Frost details a time she spent in a mental institution after being sent there by her parents. However, the short-lived ''Emma Frost'' series depicted Frost's early years differently, having her leave home and attend college. The series was supposed to cover Frost's life from high school until her first appearance as the White Queen, however, it was canceled at issue #18. ''Generation X #-1'' showed the first meeting of Emma Frost, Banshee, and the [[Dark Beast]], taking place after the events depicted in the ''Emma Frost'' series.

In ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'', Frost is shown after the events of ''Generation X #-1'' working as a stripper at the Hellfire Club before rising to the rank of White Queen. Frost is approached by Professor X and [[Moira MacTaggert]] to join a new team of X-Men along with other characters introduced in the series. The task proves harder than first anticipated and Xavier is met with great resistance from Frost. The event is then mentally erased from everyone's minds by Xavier.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Emma Frost was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to the wealthy Winston and Hazel Frost. She is the third of four children: her siblings are named Christian, [[Adrienne Frost|Adrienne]], and [[Cordelia Frost|Cordelia]]. Winston is cold, ruthless, and domineering, often imposing impossibly high standards on his children, while Hazel abuses prescription drugs to cope with the tensions of her household. Emma obtains no emotional support from her parents or her sisters, but gets along with her brother Christian.

At her school, Frost is ruthlessly bullied by her peers but finds support in teacher, Ian Kendall. When her telepathic powers manifest, Frost is able to read the minds of others and glean information. Frost becomes a tutor to the other students and Ian recommends her to be a teacher, something Frost's father refuses. On her way home from school one day, Frost's car breaks down and Ian gives her a ride home. After reading his thoughts and learning that he thinks she is beautiful and intelligent, Frost kisses him. Her sister Adrienne records it and her father uses the evidence to get Ian fired. Frost begins to fight back by blackmailing her father. Intrigued by her actions, Winston offers her the family fortune but Frost rejects his offer and decides to make her own way in life.<ref>''Emma Frost'' #1–6</ref>

After a period of homelessness, Frost meets and falls in love with a young man named Troy, who agrees to let her live with him. She learns that he owes a large amount of money to a local mobster named Lucien. In order to save Troy's life, Frost agrees to participate in a fake kidnapping scheme in an attempt to extort the remainder of Troy's debt from her father. However, this soon turns into a real kidnapping and Troy is killed while valiantly attempting to save Frost from an enraged Lucien. Using her powers, Frost turns the thugs against one another and then forces the remaining henchman to free her.

Frost takes the ransom money and enrolls in Empire State University.<ref>''Emma Frost'' #7–18</ref> There, she begins to learn about mutants for the first time and meets fellow telepath [[Astrid Bloom]], who becomes her friend and mentor.

===Diamond form===
At the moment of the destruction of Genosha, Frost manifested a secondary mutation giving her the ability to transform her body into organic diamond.<ref name="New X-Men #139"/> In this form, Frost is translucent and retains mobility while being nigh invulnerable, and able to support incredible amounts of weight.

Emma's diamond body is virtually tireless, as she does not produce fatigue poisons and has no need for water or food.<ref name="X #150 V2">''X-Men'' vol. 2, #150 (February 2004)</ref> She is also numbed from emotion, pain and empathy, impervious to cold,<ref name="XU #42 V1">''[[X-Men Unlimited]]'' #42 (April 2003)</ref> and resistant to heat in this form.<ref name="X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong #3">''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong]]'' #3 (January 2007)</ref><ref name="XPW #4">''X-Men: Phoenix – Warsong'' #4 (February 2007)</ref><ref name="X #156 V2">''X-Men'' vol. 2, #156 (June 2004)</ref> Furthermore, in this form she has no need to breathe.<ref>''Wolverine'' – The best there is #12 (Dec 2011)</ref> Despite this high level of invulnerability, her diamond form has a single molecular flaw, which, if exploited – such as being shot with a diamond bullet – can cause her body to shatter.<ref name="New X-Men #139"/>

In this diamond state, Frost is unable to access her psychic powers due to suppression by her diamond form's [[Adamantine lustre|adamantine luster]].<ref name="OHOTMU #4 (2008)">''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe IV'' (August 2008)</ref> As a result, Emma is also granted total telepathic immunity while in diamond form.<ref name="X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong #3"/><ref name="NXM #123">''[[New X-Men]]'' #123 (April 2002)</ref> Her diamond form is also stated to emit low-level [[ultraviolet light]], causing it to glow in darkness.<ref name="OHOTMU #4 (2008)"/>

Frost's diamond form also grants her superhuman strength. She has been shown to manhandle [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]],<ref name="UXM 499">''Uncanny X-Men 499''</ref> and has sent [[Lady Mastermind]] flying through a wall with a single punch.<ref name="UXM 500">''Uncanny X-Men 510''</ref>

===Innate traits and expertise===
Frost has a gifted intellect with college degrees in multiple fields, including a Bachelor of Science in Education with a minor in Business Administration from the prominent Marvel Universe's Empire State University. A superb businesswoman, Emma Frost for many years was founder and CEO of Frost Enterprises, a major multinational conglomerate headquartered in New York City that rivaled Stark Enterprises and Worthington Industries and specialized in shipping, aerospace engineering and new technology R&D.

Frost is also a highly capable planner, an [[electronics]] expert, and can invent machines that grant various psionic abilities, such as "Multivac", a mutant locater capable of monitoring the psionic levels of mutants; the "Hallucinator" used to induce hypnotic hallucinations to brainwash others; the gun-like device that enabled her to exchange minds and powers with Storm; and the Mindtap mechanism which enhanced and enabled her Hellfire cohort [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] to project his illusions directly into the mind of the Phoenix.<ref name="UXM 129-131"/><ref name="OHOTMU #4 (2008)"/><ref name="X-Men' 2007">''X-Men'' vol. 2, #201 (September 2007)</ref><ref>''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'' #2 (February 2005)</ref><ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #22 (August 2007)</ref>

Frost is well versed in medical disciplines such as neurology, biochemistry, pathophysiology and genetics. This has allowed her to medically cure [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] from an array of infectious diseases and examine [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]'s brain physiology.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #179 (February 2006)</ref><ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #187 (August 2006)</ref> Additionally, Frost has also been shown to bootstrap her own brain chemistry to counter a neurotoxin.<ref name="X-Men' 2007"/>

===Telekinetic potential===
On occasion, it has been hinted that Frost is also a latent [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]].

This phenomenon is then referred to as telekinesis and credited to Frost's psi powers.<ref name="Gen X #40">''Generation X'' #40 (July 1998)</ref>

===Resources and anonymity===
Frost possesses vast wealth as the owner of several multibillion-dollar conglomerates; Frost International, Frost Enterprises and Meridian Enterprises.<ref name="Gen X #49">''Generation X'' #49 (March 1999)</ref><ref name="Gen X #75">''Generation X'' #75 (June 2001)</ref> Additionally, Frost has also made investments in oil companies, Stark Industries, Wakandan Airways, Ben Nishmura's gamma research, Reed Richards' patent for unstable molecules and Cummings Aeronautics helicarrier project.<ref name="Gen X #75"/><ref name="Gen X #-1">''Generation X'' #-1 (July 1997)</ref> Furthermore, as CEO of Frost International, Frost has access to various technologies either designed by herself,<ref name="OHOTMU #4 (2008)"/> or made through acquisitions of corporations such as LaNeige Industries which specialises in trans-dimensional travel and weaponry.<ref name="Gen X #43">''Generation X'' #43 (October 1998)</ref>

Frost's wealth and legal resources (Brooke & Webster esq plc)<ref name="XX Annual #1">''X-Treme X-Men Annual'' #1 (February 2002)</ref> affords her a degree of anonymity over the digital medium. This has been shown to extend to databases owned by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref name="NM #40">''New Mutants'' #40 (June 1986)</ref> and the Sentinel [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]].<ref name="Gen X #23">''Generation X'' #23 (January 1997)</ref> Furthermore, several injunctions have been in place to prevent any discussion or referencing of Frost or her moniker the "White Queen" on any public networks.<ref name="XX Annual #1"/>

As a member of the Phoenix 5, Frost at one point telepathically scanned every single superhuman and human mind on the planet digging for the darkest of secrets and information.<ref name="AvX #9">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #9 (August 2012)</ref>

===Attire and paraphernalia===
Frost regards her revealing attire as battle armour which may give her a psychological edge against any opponent.<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #36 (June 1989)</ref> Additionally, Frost considers [[high-heeled footwear]] as vital to her attire,<ref name="AvX:C #3">''AvX:Consequences'' #3(October 2012)</ref> and has demonstrated balance and proficiency with them in hand-to-hand combat.<ref name="W:TBTI #12">''Wolverine: The Best There Is'' #12(December 2011)</ref> Frost has to maintain a careful balance between her fashion sensibilities and being on the battlefield as this has on one occasion hindered her mobility on mountainous terrain.<ref name="UXM #521">''Uncanny X-Men'' #521(April 2010)</ref>

In the 2010 ''What If? Astonishing X-Men'' one-shot "What if Ord resurrected Jean Grey instead of Colossus?", Jean Grey's resurrection causes friction with Emma, who believes her presence and history with the Phoenix will ensure the X-Men's demise. The two women discover that the Breakworld has predicted that Phoenix will destroy their planet. Under the deception of the psychic remnant of Cassandra Nova, Emma extracts hidden vestiges of the Phoenix Force from the remaining Stepford Cuckoos, killing them and granting her the powers of the Phoenix so that she may free Cassandra from her prison, no longer requiring Shadowcat. Emma kills Ord, destroys the Breakworld, and confronts the X-Men, killing Beast. Emma reveals her fear that Jean will proceed to take everything—including Scott—away from her now that she has returned. S.W.O.R.D. intercedes and intends to kill Emma for the destruction of the Breakworld. Jean realizes that it is actually Cassandra Nova controlling Emma.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Emma Frost, as the White Queen, is a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] in the ''[[X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men]]'' (1989) animated [[television pilot]], voiced by [[Susan Silo]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} In addition to her telepathic abilities, she displays the ability to create "psy-bolts" – sometimes called "psionic energy spears" or "psychic harpoons" – that can damage physical objects, similar to her character's abilities in early comics. Also in this series, she is able to fly.

[[Image:TASemma.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Emma Frost in the 1990s X-Men series]]
* Emma Frost first appears in cameos in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series (1992–1997), during the episode "The Phoenix Saga – Part IV".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} She is again featured as the White Queen of the Inner Circle in "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]". During this series, she is a powerful telepath. It revealed that she snuck into the X-Mansion and read the Xavier files on Jean Grey/Phoenix. She later aids the Inner Circle in tricking Jean Grey (now Dark Phoenix) into joining them. Frost is also shown using a telepathic machine (similar to [[Cerebro]]) in order to prevent Professor Xavier (who was using Cerebro) from locating Jean Grey. Emma also appears again amongst the captured telepaths in the "Beyond Good & Evil" plot. She was voiced by [[Tracey Moore]].
* Emma makes her first major non-supporting and non-cameo character role in Marvel Animations' ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} She is depicted as both a member of the X-Men team as well as an integral addition to the main cast of the series. Much like her other animated incarnations, Emma displays her abilities as an enormously strong and powerful mutant telepath and empath throughout the course of the show. However unlike her other appearances, Emma also displays her mutative signature ability to shift into a solid, hardened diamond form. Like her portrayal in the comics, she develops a strong and deep romantic affection for Scott/Cyclops. In the three-part episode "Foresight", it is revealed that she is also a member of the Hellfire Club (called the Inner Circle) in their plot to extract the Phoenix Force, though she believes that the group intends to destroy the Phoenix Force to save humanity and is shocked to hear that they intend to harness the Phoenix Force for their own purposes. Emma later ultimately sacrifices herself to prevent the Phoenix Force from causing destruction, releasing it into space; the effort causes her to turn into her diamond form and then shatter, with her last words being "Scott, forgive me".
* Emma also appears as a major character in the twelve-episode X-Men anime (part of the [[Marvel Anime]]) series, voiced by Kaori Yamagata in the Japanese version and by [[Ali Hillis]] in the English Dub.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} She is initially introduced as a psychic specter seen by Cyclops while trying to help Jean Grey in her Dark Phoenix form, which ultimately ends in Jean's death. This leads Cyclops to strongly believe Emma had something to do with Jean's death. Emma is next seen trapped in stasis and after being freed by the X-Men, aiding them, and offering them access to her mind to clear up Cyclops's suspicions, she is offered a place on the team along with Armor. Like her main comic book counterpart Emma is a mutant telepath who underwent secondary mutation to obtain her diamond form abilities. She was also a member of the Anime Universe's Hellfire Club, referred to as the "Inner Circle", but left for moral reasons to continue to her own educating of mutant children. Whilst her personality remains refined and confident like her comic book personality, Emma's personality in the anime series is considerably warmer, kinder and more understanding; she is also maternal, especially in her dealing with [[Armor (comics)|Hisako/Armor]].

===Film===
* Emma Frost appears in the 1996 live-action [[television movie]] called ''[[Generation X (film)|Generation X]]'', portrayed by [[Finola Hughes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/exclusive-director-jack-sholder-foxs-generation-x-controversial-castings-and-x-men-effect|title=Exclusive: Director Jack Sholder on Fox's Generation X, controversial castings and the X-Men effect|work=Blastr|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}</ref>
* Emma Frost was originally written to appear in director [[Bryan Singer]]'s third X-Men film and be portrayed by [[Sigourney Weaver]], but after Singer left the project, the character was not carried over to the eventual third film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.<ref>{{cite news| title =Sigourney Weaver was nearly X-Men's Emma Frost, instead in Imaginary Heroes|author=Pacienza, Angela| newspaper= [[The Canadian Press]] |date=September 15, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/features/86735-sigourney-weaver-was-going-to-be-emma-frost |title =Sigourney Weaver Was Going to be Emma Frost|publisher=SuperheroHype.com|date=2004-09-15|accessdate=2015-08-09}}</ref>
* In the 2009 feature film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', [[Tahyna Tozzi]] portrayed [[Kayla Silverfox]]'s sister,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/xmen-origins-wolverine/credits.html|title=Cast of X-Men Origins: Wolverine|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Although a trailer for the film identified the character as "Emma Frost,"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVQxtUoH7ew|title=X Men Origins Wolverine Character Spot Emma Frost|accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref> in the finished film, she was credited only as "Kayla's sister/Emma". With the later introduction of an adult Emma Frost more reminiscent of the comics character in the ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' movie (see below), this character was established to ''not'' be the movie universe's version of the character, with producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] identifying the ''First Class'' character as "the real Emma Frost", and unconnected to the character who appears in ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iamrogue.com/news/interviews/item/4757-iar-exclusive-interview-producer-lauren-shuler-donner-talks-x-men-first-class-cameos-a-possible-sequel-emma-frost-the-wolverine-and-deadpool.html/|title=IAR EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: PRODUCER LAUREN SHULER DONNER TALKS 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS' CAMEOS, A POSSIBLE SEQUEL, THE REAL EMMA FROST, 'THE WOLVERINE' AND 'DEADPOOL'|publisher=IAmRogue.com|accessdate=May 26, 2013}}</ref>
* [[January Jones]] plays Emma Frost/White Queen in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'', released by Fox on June 3, 2011.<ref>{{cite web | last=Lesnick | first=Silas | title=January Jones Joins 'X-Men: First Class' | work=[[Superhero Hype!]] | date=August 18, 2010 | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/105877-january-jones-joins-x-men-first-class | accessdate=2010-08-18}}</ref> She is a powerful telepath as well as possessing her diamond skin, and is the consort of [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], the villainous leader of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] who seeks to start a nuclear war between the Soviet Union and United States. This would eradicate all non-mutant life and mutate any survivors, leaving the Hellfire Club to rule over this new world order. [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], [[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]], and their team of teenage mutants thwart their plan, and Emma is incarcerated, though she is freed by Erik, who is now known as Magneto, at the end of the film. In this film, she is able to completely block Xavier from using his telepathy on her and Shaw, create illusions, perform mental torture, as well as sense the initial activation of Cerebro from thousands of miles away. While in diamond form, she shows absolute immunity towards psychic attack and has enhanced strength, durability, and reflexes, able to easily cut through glass and glacial ice, catch a throwing knife, and punch Magneto off a boat and into the sea. However, [[Magneto (comics)|Erik]] uses his powers to choke her with a metal bar to get information out of her while in her diamond form. This caused massive cracks in her body while in that form, and after she reverts to flesh and blood, he implies a single tap should be enough to shatter her completely should she morph. 
* In ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', Magneto lists Emma Frost as one of the many mutants who died between 1962 (''X-Men: First Class'') and 1973 (the main setting of ''X-Men: Days of Future Past''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/xmen-days-future-past-movie-easter-eggs-trivia-comic/|title='X-Men: Days of Future Past' Easter Eggs, Trivia & References|publisher=Screen Rant, LLC|date=2014-05-24|accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref> being one of the mutants tortured and experimented on by Trask Industries.
