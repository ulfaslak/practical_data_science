== Powers and abilities ==
Kenuichio Harada was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to generate a [[tachyon]] field, with which he could surround anything{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. He commonly uses his power on his sword, enabling it to cut through nearly anything, except substances as hard as [[adamantium]].

As a self-styled samurai, he was a master of [[kenjutsu]] and other martial arts. Kenuichio specialized in edged weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and [[military tactics]]. He usually wore a suit of lightweight steel alloy body armor, modeled after traditional samurai armor, but made of modern protective materials. He carried a katana (long sword), shuriken (throwing stars), and other weaponry. Keniuchio had extensive knowledge of the operations of criminal organizations due to his shady past, which he used in the service of his government to combat such organizations. He was an expert in the history and customs of the samurai class ([[Bushido]]).
