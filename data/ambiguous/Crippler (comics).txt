He is an extraordinary street-fighter, and received further training in armed and unarmed combat from the U.S. Marines, NYPD, Hydra, and Silver Sable.  He is an expert marksman, and an expert with knives, whips, staves, and most other hand weapons.

He wears a Kevlar-lined costume provided by Silver Sable, and uses his Hydra-supplied cobtraton (a sectioned telescoping steel baton), and various knives, hand guns, rifles, and flamethrowers as needed.

The Crippler has a deranged addiction to physical violence and enjoys both inflicting and experiencing physical pain.
