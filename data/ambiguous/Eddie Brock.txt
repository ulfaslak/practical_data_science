'''Eddie Brock''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Todd McFarlane]], and his earliest appearance was a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #18 (September 1986),<ref>''Spider-Man Saga'' #4, February 1992</ref> before making his first full appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #300 (May 1988)<ref name="ComicsPriceGuide" /> as the original and most well-known host of the '''[[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]''' [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]]. The character has since appeared in many Marvel Comics publications, including his own series ''Venom''. Introduced as a villain of [[Spider-Man]], the character becomes an [[antihero|anti-hero]], working with and against superheroes.

In the original version of the story, Eddie Brock is a journalist who publicly exposes the identity of a man he believes is a serial killer, only to find his reputation ruined when Spider-Man captures the real killer. Disgraced and suicidal, he comes into contact with an alien symbiote, rejected by Peter Parker. The Symbiote bonds with him and they become Venom, together seeking out revenge against their mutual enemy. Though he repeatedly comes into conflict with Spider-Man, he also attempts to operate as a hero, albeit a violent one, seeking to save those he deems "innocent". In 2008, after being separated from the Venom Symbiote, he serves as an anti-hero as host of the '''[[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]]''' symbiote which is sacrificed to help cure the "[[Spider-Island]]" epidemic during the 2011 storyline. In 2012, he was bonded to the [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]] symbiote. Though he is a human with no powers, the Venom Symbiote suit bestows upon him a range of abilities including many of Spider-Man's powers.

Debuting in the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]], the character has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[:Category:Marvel Comics animation|animated television series]]; [[video games]]; merchandise such as [[action figure]]s, and [[trading card]]s; and feature films in which he is played by [[Topher Grace]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' and by [[Tom Hardy]] in the 2018 film ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]''.

==Publication history==
{{See also|Venom (comic book)|List of Venom titles}}

===Creation and conception===
Writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Todd McFarlane]] are generally credited with the character's creation, based on a number of plot ideas and concepts from various other creators. The question of who created the character of Venom became an issue of contention in 1993 when Michelinie wrote to the comic book industry magazine ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'', which had referred to Michelinie in issue #17 as "co-creator" of Venom. In his letter, printed in issue #21 (May 1993), Michelinie wrote that he was the character's sole creator, while saying also he believed that without McFarlane the character would not have attained the popularity it did.<ref>''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #21 (May 1993)</ref>

[[Image:Amazing Spider-Man 316.jpg|thumb|upright|First cover appearance of Venom as depicted by co-creator Todd McFarlane]]
Writer [[Peter David]] corroborated Michelinie's view in his "But I Digress" column in the June 4, 1993 ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'', in which he stated that Michelinie discussed the ideas behind the character with him at the time of its creation. At that time, David was the writer on ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' and wrote the "Sin Eater" storyline from which Eddie Brock's backstory would be derived, well before McFarlane was assigned to the art duties on ''Amazing''. Because the artist who illustrates a character's first published appearance is generally credited as its co-creator (especially if that artist is the one who designs the character's visual appearance),<ref>Cronin, Brian (April 2, 2009). [https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-legends-revealed-201/ "Comic Book Legends Revealed #201"]. [[CBR.com]].</ref> Venom represents a complex situation, because the costume from which Venom's appearance is derived was not designed by McFarlane.<ref name=PeterDavid>[[David, Peter]] (June 4, 1993). "[http://www.peterdavid.net/2010/07/05/the-wacko-theory/#more-4742 The Wacko Theory]", ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'', Reprinted in the collection ''But I Digress'' (1994). pp. 104–106</ref>

[[Erik Larsen]] responded to Michelinie's letter with one of his own that was printed in ''Wizard'' #23 (July 1993), in which he dismissed Michelinie's contributions to the character, arguing that Michelinie merely "swiped" the preexisting symbiote and its powers to place it on a character whose motivations were poorly conceived, one-dimensional, unbelievable, and clichéd. Larsen also argued that it was McFarlane's rendition of the character that made it commercial.<ref>''Wizard'' magazine #23, July 1993</ref>

The preexisting elements that dealt with the symbiote costume itself—to which Michelinie did not contribute—have also been noted. The original idea of a new costume for Spider-Man that would later become the character Venom was conceived of by a Marvel Comics reader from [[Norridge, Illinois]] named Randy Schueller.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Cronin, Brian|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed Extra: Randy Schueller's Brush With Comic History &#124 |publisher=CBR.com|date=May 16, 2007}}</ref> Marvel purchased the idea for $220.00 after the editor-in-chief at the time, [[Jim Shooter]], sent Schueller a letter acknowledging Marvel's desire to acquire the idea from him, in 1982. Schueller's design was then modified by [[Mike Zeck]], becoming the Symbiote costume.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Spidey_005.JPG August 3, 1992 letter from Jim Shooter to Randy Schueller]. Comic Book Resources. Retrieved November 21, 2011</ref> For example, Shooter came up with the idea of switching Spider-Man to a black-and-white costume, possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new [[Julia Carpenter|Spider-Woman]], with artists [[Mike Zeck]] and [[Rick Leonardi]], as well as others, designing the black-and-white costume.<ref name=PeterDavid/>

[[Image:AmazingSpider-Man346.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Erik Larsen, who followed Todd McFarlane as artist on ''Amazing Spider-Man'', added the long tongue and drool to Venom's appearance.]]
Writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] asserts on his website that the idea for a costume made of self-healing biological material was one he originated when he was the artist on '' [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] '' to explain how that character's costume was constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next issue, explaining that he ended up not using the idea on that title, but that [[Roger Stern]] later asked him if he could use the idea for Spider-Man's alien costume. Stern in turn plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the title. It was writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Ron Frenz]] who had established that the costume was a sentient alien being, and that it was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' that preceded Michelinie's.<ref>[[Byrne, John]]. [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1=Miscellaneous+Questions#96 "How is it that JB "created" Venom?"]. "Frequently Asked Questions". Byrne Robotics. Retrieved July 2, 2011.</ref> Regardless, Peter David's position is that Michelinie is the sole creator, since the idea of creating a ''separate'' character using the alien symbiote was Michelinie's, as was Eddie Brock's backstory, and that without the idea to create such a character, the character would not have existed.<ref name=PeterDavid/>

In an interview with Tom DeFalco, McFarlane states that Michelinie did indeed come up with the idea of Venom and the character's basic design ("a big guy in the black costume"). However, he contends that it was he (McFarlane) who gave Venom his monster-like features. He claims; "I just wanted to make him kooky and creepy, and not just some guy in a black suit."<ref>''Comics Creators on Spider-Man'', pg 148, Tom DeFalco. (Titan Books, 2004)</ref>

This dispute arose at a time when the merits of artists as collaborators and writers were being debated in the industry, a discussion prompted by the popularity of artists such as McFarlane, Larsen, and other founders of [[Image Comics]].<ref>Wallace, Dave (February 10, 2007).

Venom's existence was first indicated in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #18 (Sept. 1986), when he shoves [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] in front of a subway train without Parker's spider-sense warning him, though only Brock's hand is seen on-panel. The next indication of Venom's existence was in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #24 (March 1987), when Parker has climbed out of a high story window to change into Spider-Man, but finds a black arm coming through the window and grabbing him, again without being warned by his spider-sense.

The character would remain unseen and inactive until ''Amazing Spider-Man'' editor [[Jim Salicrup]] required a villain for that book's 300th issue, and Michelinie suggested a villain consisting of the alien [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] grafted onto the body of a human female; seeking revenge for the deaths of her husband and miscarried baby who would accidentally die as the unfortunate result of Spider-man battling another supervillain. Salicrup accepted the suggestion, but changed the character to a male, and the female character's plot was also abandoned.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  Michelinie then devised the Eddie Brock identity. Michelinie contends that the plots for issues #298–299, as well as the visual descriptions of the character, were written and bought by Salicrup before McFarlane was ever assigned to the book.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Cancer and post-Venom===
[[Image:Eddiebrockcancer.PNG|135px|left|thumb|Eddie Brock, separated from the symbiote, dying from cancer in ''Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #39 (August 2007).]]
The 2003 story "The Hunger" introduced new elements to Brock's origin, revealing that Brock had cancer before joining with the symbiote, and that it chose to bond with Brock not only for his hatred towards Spider-Man, but also because the cancer causes the release of adrenaline, which sustains the symbiote. Brock is left reliant on the suit to live, and pursues Spider-Man out of fear that he will take the symbiote back, rather than for revenge over his lost career.<ref name="Spectacular5"/> Brock dies after the symbiote leaves him for Spider-Man, not wanting a diseased host. Spider-Man tricks the symbiote into again bonding with Brock, reviving him.<ref name="Spectacular5"/>

In the 2004 story "Venomous", Brock experiences a crisis of faith and decides to sell the symbiote, knowing he will rapidly die from his cancer without it, intending to donate the $100 million received from the sale to charity on the grounds that the symbiote would find another host once he dies anyway.<ref name="SensationalV26"/> The symbiote is purchased by crime boss [[Don Fortunato]] for his son [[Venom (Marvel Comics characters)#Angelo Fortunato|Angelo Fortunato]].<ref name="SensationalV27"/> Angelo briefly becomes the second Venom but proves an unworthy host, and the symbiote abandons him mid-jump allowing him to fall to his death. Upon learning of Angelo's death, Brock feels responsible and attempts suicide by slitting his wrists.<ref name="SensationalV28"/> Brock next appeared in the 2007 story "The Last Temptation of Eddie Brock", where he is rapidly succumbing to cancer, and experiencing hallucinations of "Venom". Finding a comatose Aunt May in the same hospital, dying from a gunshot, the Venom hallucination persuades him to kill her. Brock, dressed in a novelty replica of Spider-Man's black costume at the demand of "Venom",<ref name="SensationalV238"/> murders a nurse to test if he can still kill, but ultimately refuses to kill May because she is innocent. When Peter visits May, he finds Eddie, who has repeatedly cut his own wrists to get rid of "Venom". Eddie asks for Peter's forgiveness before jumping out of a window, but Peter manages to catch him. Awakening chained to his bed, Brock finds he can still see "Venom" but tells him that he accepts its presence as long as it knows that Brock is in control.<ref name="SensationalV239"/>

===Anti-Venom===
[[File:Anti-Venom (Eddie Brock).jpg|thumb|upright|Eddie Brock's first appearance as Anti-Venom]]
The 2008 story ''"[[New Ways to Die]]"'' features the return of Brock. Matt Murdock convinces a court of law that Brock is not responsible for his actions while bonded to the symbiote and has criminal charges against him dropped.<ref name="Amazing568"/> Brock gets a job at a soup kitchen under [[Mister Negative|Martin Li]]. Brock is unknowingly cured of his cancer by Li, who possesses special abilities, and Brock believes it to be a miracle.<ref name="Amazing568"/> After Brock is attacked by the new Venom, [[Mac Gargan]], the symbiote attempts to reunite with Brock.

Upon hearing this, the NYPD arrest Kraven the Hunter and Shriek with the police captain stating that he will have a lot of paperwork to file on this.<ref>''Venom'' #156-158</ref>

During the Venom Inc. storyline, Eddie helps Spider-Man, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], and [[Flash Thompson]] (now under the guise of Agent Anti-Venom) take down Lee Price again, who had bonded himself with Venom's clone Mania and was using it to take over the New York criminal underground.

Jameson sends Eddie to defend [[Mary Jane Watson]] at the [[Stark Tower Complex]] and while she does not trust him, Mary Jane disables Stark Tower's anti symbiote defenses to allow Eddie to fight Norman. Spider-Man arrives and teams up again with Eddie to stop Red Goblin, but the villain overpowers them both.

In ''Venom First Host'', Venom after gave birth to its last offspring, Eddie gets attacked by a Warbride [[Skrull]] until a [[Kree]] intervened and started battling the Skrull. Eddie got convinced by the symbiote to save the "blue skin", so he stopped the Skrull and saved the Kree. At Alchemax, the Kree revealed to Eddie that his name is [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Tel-Kar]] and that he was Venom's first host. When the symbiote refused to go back to Tel-Kar, infuriated Tel-Kar threatened them that he would bond to the offspring and transform it into a monster, if he did not get "his" symbiote back. Venom who loved it's child got back with Tel-Kar and then he went to his spaceship. Then Eddie confronted the Skrull who had attacked them and she introduced herself as M'Lanz and tells him that she was tasked to stop Tel-Kar. She reveals to Eddie that Tel-Kar's body was biologically altered so he would have full control over Venom's mind. Then the offspring bonded to Eddie calling itself ''Sleeper'' and him with M'Lanz went after Tel-Kar. They went to a Skrull research lab which contained a deadly bioweapon which Tel-Kar had planned to used it on the Skrulls. When battling Tel-Kar, he separates himself from Venom because he did not need it anymore allowing Eddie to re-bond with Venom and Sleeper bonding to M'Lanz leaving Tel-Kar to explode with the lab by the Kree Empire. After M'Lanz leaves Eddie with the symbiotes on Earth, Eddie cuts every connection to Alchemax and after that him and [[Harry Osborn]] talk for a little bit. Then Tel-Kar shows up in Eddie's apartment and threatens to kill him and the humanity using the bioweapon but Sleeper steals the weapon and Tel-Kar tried to kill Sleeper, but Venom intervened and got injured. Eddie rushes to Tel-Kar throwing both of them out in the street. Suddenly Sleeper bonds to Tel-Kar lobotomizing him as a punishment for he did to them. Then Sleeper with Tel-Kar's body bids Eddie farewell and leaves Earth to explore the cosmos. <ref>Venom First Host. Marvel Comics. </ref>

In the ''Venom'' ongoing series, Eddie is seen struggling with the symbiote, which has returned to its violent ways. Using [[anti-depressants]], Eddie is able to calm the symbiote and reassert control over it. While working as a freelance photographer he stumbles upon an arms deal between a gang of criminals and the mercenary [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. The deal turns violent and Eddie uses the symbiote to take down Jack. The symbiote then completely overtakes Eddie, compelled by a mysterious external influence, nearly killing Jack in the process before being subdued and captured by a man named Rex Strickland. Strickland tells Eddie that despite what was previously thought, the Venom symbiote was not the first to arrive on Earth. Strickland explains that the US Government bonded special forces operatives to symbiotes during the [[Vietnam War]]. These soldiers later went rogue, and Eddie is tasked with rescuing them and defeating their symbiotes. Though Eddie is able to locate the Strickland's men, his symbiote is again taken over by the mysterious outside influence and briefly separates from him. The symbiote again bonds with Eddie and tells him that “God is coming”.<ref>''Venom'' #1-2</ref>

Soon afterward, a massive dragon made up of thousands of symbiotes attacks [[New York City]]. Eddie resolves to stop the monster before it destroys the city. Before he can intervene he is attacked by [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], who uses his “Venom Blast” ability to break Venom out of the symbiote “god’s” influence. Miles and Eddie form a temporary truce, and the two manage to temporarily stop the symbiote god's rampage. The symbiote god then reveals itself as a being named Knull. Knull separates Eddie from his symbiote, promising to purge the influence of humanity from it.<ref>''Venom'' #3</ref> But then Miles attacked Knull and both Eddie with Venom and Miles started falling until Venom grew a pair of wings and saved Eddie and Miles. After leaving Miles behind, Eddie went to Rex and put a hole in his head revealing that Rex was actually the symbiote which was bonded to the original Rex Strickland. After that they tricked the dragon to come to them and started attacking it with sonic based weapons which weaken it. Then Eddie puts the dragon with Rex in the furnace and incinerated it to death, while Eddie and Venom got wounded in the process. <ref>''Venom'' #5</ref>

Eddie Brock after getting recovered, he's interrogated by the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] about the incident revolving around the Grendel symbiote and Knull while stating that he is not the Mister Fantastic that he is familiar with. In addition, he also talked about how the Venom symbiote was in a feral state and has been deleting Eddie's bad memories like when he found out that his father had remarried and has a child named Dylan. When Maker throws a scalpel at Eddie Brock, the Venom symbiote emerges from his shirt and catches it. Though the Venom symbiote is currently brain dread. When Eddie asks Maker if he would be able to restore it, Maker states that the only way to do that is to connect it to the Symbiote hive mind and the last person to do that was the late [[Flash Thompson]]. As Maker comments that he has ways of extracting the information he needs, Eddie asks in a distraught voice if Flash is really dead.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>
Some time after, Maker reveals to Eddie that he got hold of Venom's remnants left in Flash's body prior to becoming Anti-Venom, which contained his genetic memory and tells Eddie that it can help restore the symbiote. Maker also tells to Eddie that he's planning to get more samples from Flash's dead body, but Eddie who now considers Flash as a brother, unleashes the symbiote to Maker and gets the sample. Afterwards, he tries to escape the facility, but the sample goes to his symbiote taking the form of Flash's version of the suit. Now the symbiote with the mind of Flash Thompson helps Eddie to escape and then Eddie goes to Flash's grave to admit that Flash was a better host than him. <ref>''Venom #7''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Main|Symbiote (comics)#Powers and abilities}}
Brock is a human and has no superhuman powers without the Symbiote. Prior to joining with the Symbiote, he possesses olympic-level strength from engaging in repeated, significant weight-training exercise.<ref name="Amazing300"/><ref name="LethalProtector4"/> After separating from the Symbiote and suffering from cancer, Brock loses much of his physical muscle and possesses the strength of an average human.<ref name="AvengersAnnual1"/><ref name="SensationalV238"/> Brock's cancer is cured in the 2008 story "New Ways to Die", and he is later shown with a restored large physique.<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/> He is also shown to be proficient in combat and capable of using specialized weaponry to defeat symbiote-empowered enemies.<ref>''Venom'' #15 and #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===As Venom===
As Venom, Brock gains several abilities similar to those of Spider-Man, the Symbiote's former host, including superhuman strength, speed, agility and reflexes as well as the ability to adhere to most surfaces with his hands and feet. The Symbiote is also able to project a web-like substance from its body, similar to Spider-Man's. However, this webbing is produced organically by the Symbiote from its own mass, which means that overuse can weaken the alien until it is able to regenerate.<ref name="Amazing300"/>  The Symbiote can also send out tendrils which can be used to grab or manipulate items from a distance.<ref name="Amazing333"/> When bonded with the host, the Symbiote allows the host to bypass Spider-Man's spider-sense, preventing the hero from sensing attacks. The Symbiote is susceptible to harm from high-pitched sonic frequencies which can cause it to be severely weakened or killed. The bond between the Symbiote and Brock was strong enough that using sonics against the Symbiote could also stun and kill Brock.<ref name="Amazing300"/>

Venom's body is highly resistant to injury, capable of outright stopping bladed weapons,<ref name="AmazingAnnual25"/> bullets,<ref name="Amazing333"/> and it can help its host survive in hostile environments by filtering air, allowing survival underwater<ref name="Amazing347"/> and in toxic environments. Venom can also morph his appearance, to create disguises at will,<ref name="Amazing300"/><ref name="Amazing333"/> and camouflage itself,<ref name="LethalProtector3"/> even emulating water.<ref name="Amazing347"/>  It is also capable of psychically detecting its offspring; however, this ability can be blocked.<ref name="Amazing362"/>  This sense can be used by Brock even when separated from the suit, allowing him to detect and be detected by the Symbiote and its children.<ref name="Separation2"/><ref name="Separation3"/>  The Symbiote is capable of healing any injury and illness at an increased rate, allowing the host to survive otherwise-mortal damage.<ref name="Sinner2"/> The Symbiote and host are capable of sharing knowledge, the Symbiote being able to pass on information from previous hosts to future ones.<ref name="SensationalV27"/>

===As Anti-Venom===
Anti-Venom is created when the healing energies of Martin Li cause Brock's white-blood cells and traces of the Venom Symbiote still within his body to combine into a new suit composed of human/alien hybrid antibodies possessing powerful restorative abilities.<ref name="Amazing568"/><ref name="Amazing572"/>  Brock is capable of rapidly healing significant injury as Anti-Venom, recovering almost instantly after being shot in the head and suffering damage to his brain.<ref name="Amazing664"/><ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive"/>  However, this healing ability can be negated by the energy of Mr. Negative, counteracting the energy of Martin Li.<ref name="Amazing664"/>  Anti-Venom is able to detect when others are ill<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/> and "cure" or "cleanse" them. He is able to cure ailments from hepatitis to removing narcotics and even radiation from a person's body.<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/><ref name="Amazing571"/>  Following a failed attempt to "cure" Spider-Man by removing the radiation in his body, Anti-Venom now automatically cancels out Spider-Man's powers whenever the two are in close proximity to one another.<ref name="Amazing663"/><ref name="Amazing571"/>

As Anti-Venom, Brock's suit is corrosive to the Venom symbiote, inflicting pain and damage on the suit to the point of causing it to dissolve.<ref name="Amazing569"/><ref name="Amazing570"/> He displays similar abilities to Venom, possessing super strength, speed,<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3"/> negating Spider-Man's spider-sense,<ref name="Amazing570"/> and being able to block damage entirely from some guns and knives.<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive"/><ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3"/>  He is also capable of extending and morphing the suit to create disguises,<ref name="Amazing571"/> form items such as shields,<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/> extend his reach,<ref name="Amazing663"/> attack from a distance,<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3"/> and create tendrils.<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/>  Anti-Venom is also immune to the weaknesses of the Venom Symbiote, showing no damage or effect from direct blasts of fire, heat and sound.<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive"/><ref name="Amazing571"/>  The only shown weaknesses of the Symbiote are a highly toxic "super venom" created as a direct countermeasure using remnants of Anti-Venom's suit, and Mr. Negative's energy.<ref name="Amazing572"/>  The "super venom" causes the suit to immediately dissolve.<ref name="Amazing573"/> Mr. Negative is shown capable of using his energy to weaken or nullify the healing abilities of the suit.<ref name="Amazing664"/>

''Truth in Journalism'', a [[fan made]] short film by producer [[Adi Shankar]] and director and writer [[Joe Lynch (director)|Joe Lynch]], starring [[Ryan Kwanten]] as Brock.
