==Publication history==

The character debuted as an antagonist of the eponymous mutant superhero team in ''[[X-Men]]'' #12–13 (July & September 1965). In the first of these issues, he rampaged unseen throughout the X-Men's headquarters while the team's leader, [[Professor X]], related the character's origin in a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s.

After an initial defeat in the following issue, the Juggernaut returned in ''X-Men'' #32–33 (May–June 1967), and returned again in ''X-Men'' #46 (July 1968), then fought the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]] in ''Doctor Strange'' #182 (September 1969), X-Men member the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] in ''Amazing Adventures'' #16 (January 1973), and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #172 (February 1974).

After the canceled ''X-Men'' returned in the mid-1970s, the Juggernaut returned to fight a new iteration of the team in ''X-Men'' #101–103 (October 1975–February 1976). Storylines in ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' #37–38 (April & June 1981) and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #229–230 (June–July 1982) explored the Juggernaut's relationship with his ally [[Black Tom Cassidy]].

The X-Men and Spider-Man proved to be regular foes for the character, who appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #183 (July 1984), ''Marvel Team-up'' #150 (February 1985), and ''Uncanny X-Men'' #194 (June 1985). The Juggernaut guest-starred in ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #7 (January 1986), battled a new generation of mutants in ''X-Men'' #217–218 (April & June 1987), appeared in a flashback story in ''[[Marvel Saga]]'' #21 (August 1987), and in a humorous episode in ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #3 (December 1988).

The Juggernaut also participated in the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" storyline in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #411–412 (December 1989) and returned in ''Thor'' #429 (February 1991). Other appearances included an encounter with his creator, [[Cyttorak]], in ''[[X-Men Unlimited]]'' #12 (September 1996) and starring in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue ''Juggernaut'' #1 (April 1997).

In 1994, Marvel purchased [[Malibu Comics]] and began a series of crossovers that saw Marvel characters entering the Malibu Ultraverse. In 1995-1996, Juggernaut lead a group of Ultras, who were named The All New Exiles. The All New Exiles eventually met up with the X-Men in a special Malibu/Marvel collaboration, The All New Exiles vs X-Men, Issue #0, dated October 1995.

The character appeared in ''Juggernaut: The Eighth Day'' #1 (November 1999) and ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' Vol. 3, Nos. 23–25 (December 1999–February 2000) with similarly powered [[Incarnation|avatars]] and attempted a reformation in ''Uncanny X-Men'' # 410–413 (September–December 2002) and ''X-Men'' #162–164 (November 2004–January 2005). The Juggernaut confronted his stepbrother, Charles Xavier&mdash;leader of the X-Men&mdash;in ''X-Men: Legacy'' #219 (February 2009), and fought the Hulk in ''Hulk'' #602 (November 2009).

He appeared as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'' beginning with issue #144, and remained on the team until issue #158, during the ''Fear Itself'' limited series.

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] stated, "The characters who debuted during the early years of Marvel's mutant X-Men have been remarkably long-lived, and Cain Marko is no exception".<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===1960s===
Cain Marko is the son of Kurt Marko, who becomes Charles Xavier's stepfather when he marries Sharon Xavier after the death of her husband Brian, for which Kurt is partially responsible. Kurt Marko favors Charles and abuses his own son, Cain. Cain resents Charles and bullies him frequently. Cain Marko and his step-brother Charles serve in the [[US Army]] and are stationed in [[Korea]]. Marko finds a hidden temple dedicated to the entity [[Cyttorak]]. On entering, Marko finds and holds a huge [[ruby]] and reads the inscription on the stone aloud: "Whosoever touches this gem shall be granted the power of the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak! Henceforth, you who read these words, shall become ... forevermore ... a human juggernaut!" The gem channels Cyttorak's power into Marko. The transformation causes a [[cave-in]], and the character is buried and presumably killed, not being heard from again until a sudden assault on the X-Men's headquarters.

Xavier recounts the Juggernaut's origin to the X-Men, and after shrugging off the mansion's defenses and brushing aside the X-Men, Marko is seen clearly in the final panel as he confronts Xavier. The X-Men regroup and attack, while Xavier summons [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Human Torch]] to aid the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s; the Torch generates 'pulses' of flame that essentially hypnotize the Juggernaut, distracting him long enough for [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] to remove his helmet, making Marko susceptible to a [[telepath]]ic attack by Xavier.<ref>''X-Men'' #12-13 (July & Sept. 1965)</ref>

The Juggernaut returns seeking revenge and is delayed by three of the X-Men while [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], aided by the [[:wikt:Astral|astral]] form of mystic [[Doctor Strange]], find and use another jewel of Cyttorak, which banishes the Juggernaut to the "Crimson Cosmos", the home dimension of Cyttorak.<ref>''X-Men'' #32-33 (May–June 1967)</ref> When the Juggernaut reappears, the character has gained mystical abilities and briefly battles the mystic [[Doctor Strange]] before being banished to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] by the [[cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #182 (Sept. 1969)</ref>

===1970s===
Juggernaut reappears on Earth through sheer force of will, although the alien dimension caused him to age rapidly. The panicking villain battles former X-Man the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] before being drawn back to the same dimension.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #16 (Jan. 1973)</ref> An entity from his prison dimension reverses the aging process and removes the mystical powers on the proviso that the villain never return. The Juggernaut is accidentally pulled back to Earth at the [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] base by an interdimensional device designed to banish the Hulk. The Hulk aids the Juggernaut in escaping from the base but attacks him when the Juggernaut threatens a civilian. During the battle, the Juggernaut's helmet is removed, and he is surprised and defeated by Professor X, Cyclops, and Marvel Girl.<ref name="Hulk #172 Feb. 1974">''Hulk'' #172 (Feb. 1974)</ref>

The Juggernaut befriends [[Black Tom Cassidy]], the cousin of X-Man [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], and battles the first generation of new X-Men. When Tom falls off the battlements of Cassidy Keep after a sword duel with Banshee, Juggernaut jumps after him into the sea.<ref>''X-Men'' #101-103 (Oct; Dec & Feb. 1976)</ref>

===1980s===
Black Tom uses his niece [[Siryn]], who possesses the same powers as her father [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], to steal a shipment of the metal [[vibranium]]. The Juggernaut battles [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and the X-Men and is the only one of the criminal trio to escape capture.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #37-38 (April & June 1981)</ref> After freeing him from prison, Black Tom decides that the [[psychic]] [[Madame Web]] could be useful in his criminal pursuits. On arriving in [[New York City]], Tom sends the Juggernaut [[Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut!|to capture Madame Web]]; Juggernaut destroys several city blocks in the process, and ignores [[Spider-Man]]'s best efforts to stop him. He almost kills Web by accident when he removes her from a life support device, and abandons her. A frustrated Spider-Man eventually lures the Juggernaut into setting concrete, poured for the foundation of an office high-rise, into which he sinks without a trace;<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #229-230 (June–July 1982)</ref> he takes over a month to dig his way out.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #629">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #629</ref>

The Juggernaut, however, eventually escapes.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #12 (Sept. 1996)</ref>

The Juggernaut also stars in a solo story<ref>''Juggernaut'' #1 (April 1997)</ref> and the "Eighth Day" storyline, which introduces the entities the [[Exemplars (comics)|Exemplars]]. The Juggernaut and seven other humans are revealed to have all been empowered and corrupted by mystical entities, and as [[Incarnation|avatars]] enforce their will on Earth.<ref>''Juggernaut: The Eighth Day'' #1 (Nov. 1999)</ref> The Juggernaut resists the influence of Cyttorak and when captured by other Exemplars is aided by the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

===2000s===
The Juggernaut, courtesy of a ruse engineered by Black Tom Cassidy, eventually allies with and joins the X-Men; the plan is to destroy the team from within. When Cassidy openly betrays the Juggernaut, Marko remains with the X-Men and attempts to change his ways.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #410 - 411 (Oct. 2002); #412 (Nov. 2002)</ref> The Juggernaut befriends a young mutant boy called [[Sammy Paré]], who helps Marko reform,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #413 (Nov. 2002)</ref> despite setbacks such as a battle with the Canadian superhero team [[Alpha Flight]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #432 (Dec. 2003); #433–434 (Jan. 2004)</ref> However, when Paré discovers that Black Tom Cassidy is preparing to attack the X-Men's headquarters, he is killed.

The Juggernaut reappears and joins the team ''[[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005–2007)|New Excalibur]]'' for a brief period. One storyline expands on the Juggernaut's origin and reveals that Marko is only the most recent of a series of incarnations of Cyttorak's avatar; each battles a challenger to the death for the right to retain the entity's power.<ref>''New Excalibur'' #13 - 15 (Jan. - March 2007)</ref> During the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' storyline, the Juggernaut's power begins to wane, but by shunning his stepbrother Xavier and returning to his villainous nature, he is able to restore the link with Cyttorak, becoming powerful enough to hold his own against the Hulk.<ref>''World War Hulk; X-Men'' #1–3 (Aug.–Oct. 2007)</ref> Despite an attempt by Xavier to reform Marko, he concedes that redemption is impossible.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #219 (Feb. 2009)</ref>

===2010s===
{{plot|section|date=April 2017}}
While training his son [[Skaar (comics)|Skaar]], Bruce Banner bombs Juggernaut's house to initiate a confrontation between Skaar and the Juggernaut.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #601</ref> Skaar manages to win his first fight by throwing the Juggernaut into open space, proving to his father that he has the ability to use cunning and strategy in combat, and not simply physical strength.<ref name="Incredible Hulk #602">''Incredible Hulk'' #602</ref>

During ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline, Spider-Man finds the [[Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut!#Something Can Stop the Juggernaut|Juggernaut unconscious]]. The government comes along and transports the Juggernaut to a secure facility. Spider-Man sneaks into the facility to ask the Juggernaut who did this to him. Then, a new [[Captain Universe]] breaks into the room and claims he's there to slay the Juggernaut.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #627</ref> Spider-Man learns that Captain Universe is a man named William Nguyen who wants revenge on Juggernaut for ruining his life during [[Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut!|his previous fight with Spider-Man]] over Madame Web.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #628">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #628</ref> When he insists on trying to kill Juggernaut instead of fixing the tectonic plates beneath New York City, the Uni-Power leaves Nguyen and enters the Juggernaut. The Juggernaut, as Captain Universe, repairs the damage to the tectonic plates that was caused by him during the same rampage that ruined Nguyen's life.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #629"/>

Following the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, Juggernaut is shown at The Raft at the start of the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline – weakened, since Cyttorak apparently took his temporary empowerment by the Uni-Power as an affront and withheld part of his "blessing". Following [[Luke Cage]]'s appointment as leader of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], Cain is brought up for suggestion for the program. While Cage is initially against his joining, Professor X telepathically contacts Luke and asks him to reconsider, believing he has a chance at redemption despite what he previously told Cain. Juggernaut agrees to do whatever Luke says, partly because he is now suffused with nanomachines which can affect him in his weakened state.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' # 144</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, one of the seven Hammers of the Worthy that was launched to Earth by [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]: God of Fear lands near Juggernaut. Juggernaut lifts it and becomes Kuurth: Breaker of Stone. His transformation is enough to level the Raft, causing a mass prison break.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #2</ref> Kuurth makes his way to California and fights the X-Men. Magik, Colossus, and Shadowcat go to Cyttorak's dimension and inform it that the Serpent has control over Juggernaut. Magik strikes a deal with Cyttorak, who chooses her to become the new host of the Juggernaut's powers. However, the entity transfers the Juggernaut's powers to Colossus instead. Colossus is able to turn the tide on Kuurth before Kuurth is teleported away by the Serpent.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #540–542</ref> During the last battle between the Avengers and the Worthy, Kuurth is defeated by Wolverine using his Uru armor and loses his hammer when the Serpent is killed by Thor.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #7</ref>

Cain Marko, apparently having been incarcerated after the events of ''Fear Itself'', having lost the power of both Kuurth and Cyttorak (but retaining his enormous physique) is released into military custody. Subsequently, he is taken to the borders of the country of Sharzhad just as the Thunderbolts return from their tumultuous tumble through time, and Satana aids Man-Thing in opening a gateway to the Crimson Cosmos (or possibly an alternate universe where Cain Marko had died while still the Juggernaut). Pushing his hand through, Marko is re-empowered, becoming the Juggernaut once more, just in time to thunder forth and smash through the otherwise unbreakable force field surrounding the country. This allows the Thunderbolts to resolve an otherwise deadly threat to the planet, as had been orchestrated by the Ghost, who had sent the request for Marko's release back through time.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #182</ref> He soon loses these borrowed powers again and lives in solitude in the desert, still, it seems, super-strong, although not mystically-empowered.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #183</ref> Meanwhile, Magik purges the Juggernaut powers from Colossus with her Soulsword.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 2) #20</ref>

After a time, Cyttorak causes the Crimson Gem to reappear in the ancient temple and emit a call for suitable candidates to become a new Juggernaut. Cain Marko, finally having found peace—even tending a vegetable garden—senses the call and, having armed himself, coerces the [[Vanisher]] to take him to the Gem's location. He comes into conflict with a team of X-Men (having been alerted by Colossus, who also perceived the call), as well as seekers of the Juggernaut's power such as [[Man-Killer]]. Marko and Colossus struggle with one another, only to realize that they have the same goal—to destroy the Crimson Gem and prevent another avatar being empowered. Ahmet Adbol, the former [[Living Monolith]], claims the Gem and is transformed into an amalgam of Living Monolith and Juggernaut.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 #16–17</ref> As the colossal new Juggernaut wreaks havoc in the countryside, Colossus invokes Cyttorak, and the god responds to his former exemplar. Arguing that the Monolith-Juggernaut will eventually fail Cyttorak, as all his former avatars have done, Colossus challenges him to try something new: empower him enough to kill Cyttorak himself. Apparently daunted by this prospect, the god withdraws his power from Ahmet Abdol and instead empowers another avatar, to a greater extent than any Juggernaut has ever been. However, the new avatar is not Colossus, but once more Cain Marko. Marko is full of rage, which he focuses on the X-Men and specifically Cyclops (who isn't even present), for killing Professor Xavier. Now more powerful than ever and stripped of even his last weaknesses, he feels that Charles Xavier was the only one who ever truly believed in Cain Marko. Colossus attempts to battle the empowered Juggernaut, but dodges Cain's blows rather than fighting him head on. Peter eventually "cheats" and strikes the sea side cliff edge where they had been fighting, causing Cain to fall into the ocean below, but in the end, he is seen rising from the waves once again.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 #18–19</ref>

The Juggernaut and Black Tom resurface attacking a luxury yacht, but they are confronted by the time-displaced [[All-New X-Men|young X-Men]], with Jean knocking Black Tom out while Beast - who has been training in magic - creates a dimensional portal that passes through Hell before sending Juggernaut to Siberia.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #1</ref>

Cain next appears in Ice Man #5, STILL looking for those responsible who killed his half-brother Charles Xavier. He runs into Ice man who's having his family issues of his own. Bobby, thankful for the distraction, engages Cain. At the end of the fight, Ice man encases Juggernaut in an ice cage and rocket's him into the nearby river via ice elevator sling-shot. Then he creates some ice simulacrum that carry/swim him down river, removing Cain from the area altogether.<ref>''Ice Man'' #5</ref>

A continuation where Ice Man #5 left off, Cain is apprehended by SHIELD and is being flown to a secure location but gets accidentally summoned by Dr. Voodoo to the X-Mansion. Cain fights a mixed team of veterans (Rogue, Quicksilver, Wanda, Dr. Vodoo & Wasp) and newbie (Quicksilvers latest girl-friend: Synapse). Once Juggernaut has engaged them, Rogue power punches him away from the team to give them more space. Quicksilver attempts to finish the fight quickly by racing Synapse over to Cain to get his helmet off so she can mentally neutralize him. Pietro quickly gets the helmet off but finds out cain's wearing a mental protection SKULL CAP underneath! Cain subsequently knocks Synapse into next week almost killing her. More battle ensues and Dr. Vodoo sends his summoned Cyttorak "bob the builder" minions to "fix" Cain's armor and thus "sealing" him inside his armor. The little Cyttorak builder's then carry Cain back into Cyttorak's realm and Dr. Voodoo closes the portal.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers Vol 3'' #29</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
When Cain Marko finds the Gem of the mystical entity [[Cyttorak]], he is empowered with magical energies and transformed into an immortal [[Incarnation|avatar]] for the entity in question.<ref>''Juggernaut: The 8th Day''; ''Avengers'' vol. 3, #24-25 (Jan.-Feb. 2000)</ref> As the Juggernaut, Marko possesses superhuman strength, being capable of shattering mountains,<ref name="Hulk #172 Feb. 1974"/> lifting and using buildings as weapons,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #361 (Nov. 1998)</ref> and extreme durability.<ref name="Thor #429 Feb. 1991"/>

Juggernaut is able to generate a mystical [[force shield|force field]] that grants him additional [[invulnerability]] to any physical attack when it is at its maximum.<ref name="X-Men #13 Sept. 1965">''X-Men'' #13 (Sept. 1965)</ref> Even when the force field is temporarily absorbed by Thor's hammer, the Juggernaut's natural durability still proves to be great enough to withstand blows from Thor.<ref name="Thor #429 Feb. 1991"/> The Juggernaut is described as physically unstoppable once in motion,<ref name="X-Men #13 Sept. 1965"/> does not tire from physical activity, and is able to survive without food, water, or oxygen. The Juggernaut heals quickly, as when he was stabbed through the eyes by [[Shatterstar]], the wounds were healed almost immediately.<ref>''Spider-Man #16''</ref>

It is possible for an opponent with sufficient physical or mystical strength of their own to turn the Juggernaut's unstoppable movement against him, by redirecting his motion so that he gets stranded in a position in which he has no escape; both the Hulk and his son, Skaar, have done this physically,<ref name="Incredible Hulk #602"/> and Thor has done it mystically with [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]].<ref>''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #3</ref><ref>="Thor vol. 1 #412"</ref> The only character to have stopped Juggernaut while he was in motion as an act of pure physical strength was the Hulk while he was War, a horseman of Apocalypse and empowered with Celestial technology.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #457</ref>

When Marko gains complete access to the Gem's powers during the Trion saga, it increases his power a thousandfold. Trion Juggernaut is capable of altering the size of matter, growing in size, tracking, levitation, absorbing and projecting energy, increasing his own strength, and creating portals through space-time.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #369</ref>

The character is vulnerable to [[telepathy|mental attacks]], a weakness that has been exploited via the removal of his helmet, which normally protects him from such.<ref name="X-Men #13 Sept. 1965"/> The Juggernaut has circumvented this weakness on occasion by wearing a metal [[Capeline|skullcap]] inside his main helmet.<ref name="Marvel Team-Up' 1985"/> If Juggernaut loses his helmet, he can magically recreate it from available raw materials (as long as he possesses the full power of the gem).<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #628"/>

After Cyttorak's re-empowering of Cain Marko, his strength and durability were raised to higher levels than ever before, and his vulnerability to mental attacks was negated.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 # 19</ref>

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] universe, Cain is a monk who works as a protector of Avalon. He guides Mystique and Nightcrawler to meet Destiny,<ref>''X-Calibre'' vol. 1 #1</ref> but subsequently suffers an aneurysm when his desire not to hurt others conflicts with his lust for violence during an attack on Avalon.<ref>''X-Calibre'' vol. 1 #3</ref>
===Days of Future Past===
Juggernaut is mentioned in thought by [[Rachel Summers]] as having been alive [[Days of Future Past|in her original timeline]], where he shared the power of the Cyttorak Jewel with Black Tom and they assisted the mutant resistance in their fight against the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] for a time.<ref name="Marvel Team-Up' 1985"/>

===Marvel Zombies===
In the [[Marvel Zombies]] universe, a zombified Juggernaut is seen in a horde of zombified villains.<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #4</ref> He is later killed by Wolverine when Wolverine shoves his fist in Juggernaut's mouth and proceeds to use his newly obtained cosmic powers to decapitate him.<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #5</ref>

===MC2===
In the futuristic [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, the title ''[[J2 (comics)|J2]]'' stars the son of the Juggernaut, Zane Yama. Yama, who inherits his father's powers and goes by the name J2, joins the future Avengers and is eventually reunited with his father Cain Marko, who is trapped in an alternate dimension.<ref>''J2'' #1 - 12 (Oct. 1998 - Oct. 1999)</ref>

===What If?===
In a reality where Xavier acquires the Crimson Gem rather than Cain, Cain joins forces with Magneto and Xavier's disillusioned students, the X-Men. Believing that Xavier's more ruthless methods contradict his alleged dream of peaceful co-existence and using a telepathy-blocking headband to prevent Xavier from realizing what he is up to, they expel the Juggernaut into space. Cain leaves with Magneto after Xavier's Juggernaut is dispatched.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #13</ref>

In ''What if?'' Vol2 #96, in a reality where Cain successfully defeats the X-Men in their first battle, the Sentinels are thus released in mass numbers without the X-Men to oppose them, resulting in Earth's destruction in their subsequent assault. Although Cain eventually destroys the Sentinels through sheer persistence, he is left alone wandering in a post-apocalyptic wasteland with all other humans, and even animals having been killed by the radiation released by the Sentinels.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #94</ref>

* Juggernaut appears in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]].<ref>[http://voicechasers.com/database/showactor.php?actorid=2248]</ref> In this show, Juggernaut is [[Professor X]]avier's half-brother (rather than step-brother) and his powers are a result of a dormant mutant ability. This ability is awakened by the gem of Cyttorak. At some point, he has been caught and placed in stasis at a secure facility. [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] releases him to get Xavier's [[Cerebro|computer]] to give to Mystique. Juggernaut betrays Mystique and smashes through the [[X-Mansion|X-Men's mansion]]. The [[X-Men]] and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants team up and defeat Juggernaut by taking off his helmet to allow the Professor to knock him out with mental attacks. In the end, Juggernaut is re-imprisoned, and the X-Men hope the Brotherhood will come to their side eventually.

===Film===
{{main|X-Men (film series)}}

[[File:Juggsmovie.PNG|175px|thumb|[[Vinnie Jones]] as Juggernaut in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'']]
* In the first script of ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', written by [[Andrew Kevin Walker]], the character was supposed to be a part of the Brotherhood of Mutants and one of Magneto's minions.<ref>http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/x-men_walker3.html</ref> However, this was scrapped when Walker rewrote the script.{{cn|date=September 2016}}
* Cain Marko / Juggernaut appears in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', played by [[Vinnie Jones]]. He serves as one of Magneto's Brotherhood Alliance army. In this adaptation, he is a mutant with no explicit connection to [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] or the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak. His mutation granted him the inability to be halted once he starts running, and superhuman strength sufficient to fight Wolverine to a standstill. During the battle on Alcatraz Island, Magneto orders him to destroy the cure, but is foiled by [[Kitty Pryde]] and knocks himself out when he attempts to run through a wall while in the presence of the power-negating [[Leech (comics)|Leech]]. Vinnie Jones has said he would like to reprise Juggernaut in a spin-off, as he felt there was too little time in ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' to imbue the character with depth.
* The character was originally written to appear in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' but was replaced by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]. [[Josh Helman]] was cast as the character but was recast as [[William Stryker]] instead.<ref>{{cite web|last=Collura|first=Scott|title=Turns out Juggernaut Was Originally in X-Men: Days of Future Past |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/13/turns-out-juggernaut-was-originally-in-x-men-days-of-future-past|publisher=IGN|accessdate = 2014-03-13}}</ref>

Marko is kept imprisoned at the Icebox, an isolated prison for mutants, where he befriends a young [[Rusty Collins|Russell Collins / Firefist]] when the latter is looking for a powerful ally to protect him. Russell frees the Juggernaut while they're being transferred on a truck and he destroys the vehicle, ending a fight between [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Deadpool]], and rips the latter in two with his bare hands before heading to destroy the [[Mister Sinister|Essex]] orphanage where Firefist was abused by its headmaster. Cable, Deadpool, and Domino have a hard time controlling the massive mutant, when [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] arrives to fight the Juggernaut. Colossus is also almost defeated before [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] and [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]] intervene to help him. Yukio ties the Juggernaut's feet together, Colossus sticks an electrical cable into his anus, and Negasonic blasts him into a pool, where he's electrocuted and stays incapacitated for the remainder of the film. He is last seen making his way out of the electrified fountain before the credits roll.

After losing his helmet and being dropped through an Oscorp building, Juggernaut finally discovers the fragment on his person and uses its power to strengthen himself for a final battle with Spider-Man.

The clip became a popular [[internet meme]], so popular that the line was included in ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' during Juggernaut's fight with [[Kitty Pryde]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1532557/x-men-last-stand-secrets-revealed.jhtml |title=Nine Things You Need to Know Before Seeing 'X-Men' This Weekend |last=Carroll |first=Larry |date=26 May 2006 |publisher=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref>.
