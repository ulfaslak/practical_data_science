"'''Thunderbolt'''" '''Ross''' (also known as '''[[Red Hulk]]''') is a [[fictional character]] who appears in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Ross, the archenemy of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], is a [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] [[Officer (armed forces)#United States|officer]], the father of [[Betty Ross]], ex-father-in-law of [[Glenn Talbot]], father-in-law of Dr. Bruce Banner, and was head of the Gamma Bomb Project that turned Banner into the Hulk.

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}
Thunderbolt Ross first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #1 (May 1962), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] as a nemesis for the Hulk. He was a reappearing character throughout this series. His character origin was revealed in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #291. The Red Hulk first appeared in ''Hulk'' vol. 1 #1 (January 2008) where he was created by [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Ed McGuiness]], but his identity as Ross was not revealed until later. He starred in this full series of 5 volumes. The origin of Red Hulk was revealed in ''Hulk'' #23.

Red Hulk began appearing as a regular character in ''Avengers'' vol. 4, from issue #7 (January 2011) through its final issue #34 (January 2013). His popularity resulted him starring as a main character in the 2012 ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' series by [[Daniel Way]] and [[Steve Dillon]].<ref name=CBR-Thunderbolts>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40965 |title=Way and Dillon Confirmed For Marvel NOW! "Thunderbolts" |last=James |first=Adam |date=September 12, 2012 |publisher=CBR.com|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref> He also guest starred in the issues #1-3 of the 2011 series, ''[[The Avenging Spider-Man]]'' (November 2008) by [[Zeb Wells]] and [[Joe Madureira]] as a team-up character for the main character [[Spider-Man]].

==Fictional character biography==
Ross grew up in a military environment with both his father and paternal grandfather in the military.<ref>''Defenders: Strange Heroes'' #1</ref>

Ross is a General in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] who is in charge of Bruce Banner's [[gamma bomb]] project. His daughter, Betty, takes a liking to the young scientist, a fact which only enhances the dislike the rough Ross has for the "weakling" scientist Banner. After Banner's transformation into the Hulk, Ross spends years chasing the monster, becoming obsessed enough with it to commit [[Treason in the United States|treason]] by allying himself with the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], [[MODOK]] and the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]<ref>{{Comic book reference|Writer=[[Steve Englehart]]|Penciller=[[Herb Trimpe]]|Inker=Sal Trapani|Story=Two Years Before the Abomination!|Title=The Incredible Hulk|Issue=159|Date=January 1973|Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> in order to destroy the Hulk. [[Military discharge#Analogous proceedings for commissioned officers|Dismissed]] from the military, he shows up at Betty and Bruce's wedding with a gun, and shoots [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]. He is recruited by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Clay Quartermain]] to merge with the electric creature [[Zzzax]], a process that gives Ross superpowers, but also makes him mentally unstable. He is later restored to human form but retains some residual energy-generating powers.<ref>''Hulk'' #325 – 327 (Nov. 1985 – Feb. 1986)</ref>

Finally the Nevermind, a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who drains people of their life energy, attacks Gamma Base in search for a strong host, in this case the Hulk. After witnessing [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] (who was the Hulk at that time) and Banner heroically engaging the mutant, Ross, realizing that he has been wrong about the Hulk being a mindless monster, saves his daughter from being slain by allowing the mutant to latch onto him, and discharging the energy resources he retained from Zzzax. Giving his blessing to Bruce and Betty, he dies in his daughter's arms.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #330</ref>

Ross' body is later stolen by the Leader, who uses the powers of one of his followers to resurrect Ross. He turns him into a mindless replacement for his fallen soldier Redeemer. Ross is eventually recovered and revived by agents of the alien Troyjan, and returns to the Air Force. He would later come up with a more cost-effective method of confronting the Hulk when he is in his childlike stage: active non-resistance. He and his men simply do not fire on or engage the Hulk in any way. The Hulk, confused, does not smash and leaps away.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

Ross would make friends with Banner, but when Betty is seemingly killed due to what both Ross and Banner believed to have been Banner's gamma-irradiated [[DNA]] interacting with hers, he once more pursues the Hulk with a vendetta.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

Around this time, General Ryker takes over the pursuit of the Hulk. Ross is indirectly involved, observing when Ryker mentally tortures Banner to try to figure out how the Hulk works. The Hulk escapes from Ryker's control and after several adventures, is lost in space.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

After the Hulk returns from exile and initiates "[[World War Hulk]]", General Ross, now wearing the stars of a [[General (United States)|full general]], makes his own return, electing to bring the fight to his nemesis once more after [[Iron Man]] is felled by the Goliath. After a failed assault on the Hulk, Ross and his men are captured and placed in chains under the watch of Hulk's [[Warbound]], the army he has brought back from space. The Hulk is eventually defeated via satellite weapons that fire upon him, reverting him to human form.<ref name=HulkV2#23>{{Comic book reference|Writer=[[Jeph Loeb]]|Penciller=Ed McGuinness|Inker=[[Mark Farmer]]|Story=Who is the Red Hulk?|Title=Hulk|volume=2|Issue=23|Date=August 2010|Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

===Military branch===
Ross' military affiliation has been inconsistently portrayed in the comics. Many early Hulk stories depicted Ross as an [[United States Army|Army]] general trying to capture or destroy the Hulk with his U.S. Army [[United States Army battalion|battalion]], called the "[[Hulkbusters]]". However, he is also frequently seen in an Air Force uniform, as in his first appearance in ''Incredible Hulk'' #1. However, stories about his service during [[World War II]] portray him as an Army officer in the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]], as the Air Force was not a separate branch of the Armed Forces until September 18, 1947. In a November 2010 Q&A column, then-Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] clarified that Ross is a member of the U.S. Air Force, and that inconsistencies in his uniform can be explained via the artistic license with which artists attempt to present a more dramatic-looking uniform, and that Ross may be a part of a [[United States special operations forces|special unit]] of the U.S. Air Force, or the [[Marvel Universe]]'s version of it, which has its own unique dress code.<ref>[[Quesada, Joe]]. [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22557 "CUP O' Q&A: Spider-Man & The Hulk!"], Comic Book Resources, August 14, 2009</ref>

The Army continuity is also followed in various Hulk adaptations, such as in the original [[The Marvel Super Heroes#The Incredible Hulk|1966]] and [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|1996–1998]] cartoon versions of the Hulk, as well as the 2003 [[Ang Lee]] movie, [[Hulk (film)|''Hulk'']] in which he is portrayed by [[Sam Elliott]], and in the 2008 superhero movie ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', in which he is played by [[William Hurt]]. ''The [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]: Hulk 2004'' issue officially indicates Ross to be a three-star [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] in the U.S. Air Force.

The opening story arc of the ''Hulk'' series that premiered in 2008 established that the character is very aggressive, as the Red Hulk murders Hulk foes the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] and [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]; destroys the [[Helicarrier]] of the spy organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]; defeats several Marvel heroes and, after causing an [[earthquake]] in [[San Francisco]], is finally defeated by the combined efforts of the Hulk and the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].
In a subsequent storyline, the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] teams the character with other villains in a team called the Offenders, an evil version of superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], in a bid to prevent the original Hulk from reuniting with past love [[Jarella]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Writer=Jeph Loeb|Penciller=Ed McGuinness|Inker=Dexter Vines, Mark Farmer|Story=Hulk No More|Title=Hulk|volume=3|Issue=10–12|Date=April – June 2009|Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> In this story Red Hulk siphons the Power Cosmic from the [[Silver Surfer]] seemingly killing him, steals his board along with [[Terrax]]' cosmic axe, and uses the power to go on a killing spree offing [[Namor]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Dr. Strange]], [[Baron Mordo]], the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] and before that Terrax, a time displaced Hulk, and [[Psycho Man]]. However, when Red Hulk reveals this to Galactus the deity swiftly takes back the Power Cosmic from him.

It is later revealed that the Red Hulk was created as part of a [[Super Soldier]] program by persons including [[Doc Samson]],<ref>{{Comic book reference|Writer=Jeph Loeb|Penciller=Ed McGuinness|Inker=Mark Farmer, Dexter Vines|Story=Red Hulk|Title=Hulk|volume=3|Issue=1–6|date=February 2008|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> and the criminal [[think tank]] [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]],<ref name=Alpha>{{Comic book reference|Writer=[[Jeff Parker (comics)|Jeff Parker]]|Penciller=[[Paul Pelletier]]|Inker=Vicente Cifuentes|Story=Meeting of the Minds|Title=Fall of the Hulks: Alpha|volume=|Issue=|Date=February 2010|Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> headed by the Hulk foe [[MODOK]].<ref name=Incredible600>{{Comic book reference|Writer=Jeph Loeb|Penciller=Ed McGuinness|Inker=Mark Farmer|Story=Seeing Red|Title=The Incredible Hulk|volume=2|Issue=600|Date=September 2009|Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> The 2009 "Code Red" story arc<ref name=RedSheHulk/> also made allusions to Red Hulk's real identity, and introduced a [[Red She-Hulk]] character, when [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] identifies Red Hulk before his transformation.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Writer=Jeph Loeb|Penciller=[[Ian Churchill]]|Inker=Mark Farmer|Story=Code Red|Title=Hulk|volume=2|Issue=14–17|Date=October – December 2009|Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

In the 2010 storyline "Fall of the Hulks: Gamma", Red Hulk is related in flashback to have killed General Ross at the behest of Bruce Banner, with whom he has formed an alliance.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Writer=Jeph Loeb|Penciller=[[John Romita, Jr.]]|Inker=|Story=|Title=Fall of the Hulks: Gamma|volume=|issue=|date=February 2010|Publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> However, the 2010 "[[World War Hulks]]" storyline reveals that Red Hulk is Thunderbolt Ross himself, the Red She-Hulk his daughter Betty, and that the Ross who was "killed" was a [[Life Model Decoy]] used to convince the world that he had died. Red Hulk then thwarts the Intelligencia's plan to take over the [[United States]] with a Life Model Decoy of [[Glenn Talbot]] by destroying the Talbot LMD, and attempts to take over the country himself.<ref name=HulkV2#23/> He is thwarted by a restored Hulk (in possession of Banner's intelligence) who beats Red Hulk mostly due to Red's exhaustion and from overheating. Hulk tells Red Hulk that it was his idea to fake Ross' death and that he can never again resume that identity. After imprisoning Red Hulk in the Gamma Base, Banner makes arrangements with [[Captain America|Captain Steve Rogers]] for Red Hulk to join the Avengers.<ref name="HulkV2#24">{{Comic book reference|writer=Jeph Loeb|penciller=Ed McGuinness|Inker=Mark Farmer|story=The Strongest There Is|title=Hulk|volume=2|issue=24|date=September 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref><ref name="HulkV2#25">{{Comic book reference|Writer=[[Jeff Parker (comics)|Jeff Parker]]|Artist=Gabriel Hardman|inker=|Story=Scorched Earth|title=Hulk|volume=2|issue=25|date=November 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

After Captain Steve Rogers recruits Red Hulk, Red Hulk manages to stop Intelligencia's failsafe plan, "Scorched Earth." Although Banner had claimed that he removed Red Hulk's energy-draining ability from him because it was killing Red Hulk, Red Hulk is shown to still possess this ability.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #25–26 Marvel Comics.</ref> After the events of the Scorched Earth program, Red Hulk is paired up with a female Life Model Decoy named Annie.

Augie De Blieck Jr. of [[Comic Book Resources]] gave the first six issues a positive review, describing it as a "silly fun action romp" and a "popcorn comic". De Blieck liked Loeb's lack of subtlety when giving out clues, saying "this is a book where anytime someone is about reveal the solution to the big mystery, they get knocked out by a slap in the face from the Red Hulk or a machine gun to the gut". His one criticism was that, although he liked the artwork, he would have preferred [[Dale Keown]] as the artist.<ref name="Augie">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19411|title=Pipeline|last=De Blieck|first=Augie, Jr. |date=January 6, 2009|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=March 4, 2009}}</ref>
