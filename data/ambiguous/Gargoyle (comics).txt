'''Gargoyle''' is a name shared by two [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The first Gargoyle, '''Yuri Topolov''', appears in ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #1 (May 1962), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. The Gargoyle's appearance in ''Rampaging Hulk'' #1 is merely part of one of [[Bereet]]'s fictional techno-art films.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The first Gargoyle received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #17, where his real name was revealed.

The second Gargoyle, '''Isaac Christians''', is a human/[[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] composite and a member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He was created by writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and artist [[Don Perlin]]. Perlin's design was inspired by a sequence in ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' in which the titular hero disguises himself as a gargoyle.<ref name="back65">{{cite journal |last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel|date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|page=12 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> During his long run on ''The Defenders'', Gargoyle also was the co-star of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #119, written by his co-creator DeMatteis, who later described the issue as "one of my favorite ''favorite'' stories."<ref name="DAK39"/>

In 1985 Marvel published a four-issue ''Gargoyle'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], written by DeMatteis and drawn by [[Mark Badger]]. DeMatteis said of the series, "It was a psychological fantasy. You take the interior life and make it concrete... give it substance... and play with it."<ref>{{cite news | first1 = Jim | last1 = Salicrup | first2 = Mike | last2 = Higgins | authorlink1 = Jim Salicrup | date = September 1986 | title = J.

We'd had him in ''Defenders'' for years and Don Perlin and I were... We came to like him so much, ''as a person''... this was a classic case of the character coming alive for us. We came to like Isaac Christians, this little old man inside the Gargoyle's body, so much that it began to mellow out the way we portrayed the outer shell, the gargoyle aspect. And, before you know it, he's this cute little funny animal. Which he was never intended to be.<ref name="DAK39">{{cite news | first1 = Jim | last1 = Salicrup | first2 = Mike | last2 = Higgins | authorlink1 = Jim Salicrup | date = October 1986 | title = J.

In a 2013 interview DeMatteis said that Gargoyle "is a character I still have tremendous fondness for."<ref name="back65"/>

'''Yuri Topolov''', was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientist and the first foe of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. An atomic accident caused by working with radiation mutated him into a grotesque, large-headed dwarf of extremely high intelligence. He was informed of the Hulk by an imprisoned spy using a miniature transmitter, and succeeded in capturing him and Rick Jones using a gun that fired will-weakening pellets. Bruce Banner managed to cure him using Gamma rays. He gratefully used his rocket to send Banner and Jones back to the United States and managed to destroy several [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] generals and 'die like a man' in an explosion he set off.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #1</ref>

However, he passed this deformity on to his son, the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]].

'''Isaac Christians''' was an elderly man who sold his soul to an alliance of minor demons styling themselves as "[[Demons in the Marvel Universe#Others|The Six-Fingered Hand]]" in exchange for prosperity for the dying hometown that his ancestors had founded (the fictional town of Christiansboro, Virginia). Christians made a pact with the [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demon]] Avarrish to inhabit the body of an ancient gargoyle and act as an agent of the Six-Fingered Hand. The demons of the Hand transferred Christians' life force into the Gargoyle body and sent him on a mission to capture [[Patsy Walker]], at that time operating as [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] member Hellcat. Christians battled the Defenders, but rebelled against the Hand. He was trapped in the gargoyle's body, but joined the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' #94</ref> The Defenders then helped him defeat the Six-Fingered Hand.<ref>''Defenders'' #99-100</ref>

As a member of the Defenders, Gargoyle helped the [[Squadron Supreme]] defeat the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] and [[Null, the Living Darkness|Null the Living Darkness]].<ref>''Defenders'' #112-114</ref> The Gargoyle briefly fell under the control of an Afghan wizard, and he was forced to battle the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' #136-137</ref>

Christians later returned to Christianboro, and was later released from the Gargoyle body and the original demon spirit re-inhabited it. Christians, to prevent the chaos being wreaked by the gargoyle, re-assumed the body with the help of a druid and killed his original human body to prevent the demon from returning.<ref>''Gargoyle'' #1-4</ref>

[[Moondragon]], under the influence of the [[Dragon of the Moon]], later separated Christians' life force from the gargoyle body. The body was to be used as a vessel for the Dragon of the Moon, and it became larger and more grotesque. The gargoyle body was carbonized and transformed into a statue of ash, when the Defenders defeated Moondragon and the Dragon of the Moon.<ref>''Defenders'' #152</ref>

Christians' life force came to reside in a crystal talisman. He reconciled with the spirit of Moondragon, and journeyed with [[Sundragon|Pamela Douglas]] to [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]], where he witnessed the rebirth of Moondragon.  Eventually, the former Defender known as [[Cloud (comics)|Cloud]] created a new body for Christians, with the ability to change back and forth between his gargoyle and human form.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #16, 18, 20</ref>

Alongside the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]], [[Starlight (Marvel Comics)|Starlight]], [[Jack of Hearts]], and others, he eventually returned to Earth from the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s laboratory world.<ref>''Quasar'' #19-20</ref>

When the final confrontation between [[Gabriel, Devil Hunter]], and [[Daimon Hellstrom|Hellstrom]] left Gabriel irretrievably insane, only capable of babbling incoherently, Hellstrom left him in the care of the Gargoyle.<ref>''[[Daimon Hellstrom|Hellstorm]]'' #21</ref>

Following the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Christians has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He was shown flying in an attack against [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]];<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2 (July 2007)</ref> this helped save the President from an assassination attempt.

==Powers and abilities==
The second Gargoyle is the result of the magical transfer of Isaac Christians' spirit into the body of the Gargoyle. Gargoyle possessed superhuman strength and durability in his gargoyle form. His leathery hide offered resistance to various forms of physical attack. He could manipulate "bio-mystical" energy to numerous effects, including concussive blasts and projection of the emotion of fear into others. He could siphon bio-mystical energy from others, causing temporary debilitating weakness. Surrounding himself in a field of bio-mystical energy granted Gargoyle limited immunity to certain types of spells. Gargoyle could fly via mystical levitation; his wings were incapable of producing sufficient lift but could be used for navigation. Gargoyle could regenerate lost or damaged limbs, although they would differ wildly in appearance from the original limb. Over-expenditure of bio-mystical energy over a short time could weaken or kill the Gargoyle; also, he could be commanded to act against his will by a wizard who spoke a particular obscure spell. Isaac Christians was a student of the occult with minor mystical ability. Prior to his transformation, Christians had some ability to manipulate mystical forces, including rudimentary spell-casting and summoning demons.

==In other media==

===Television===
* The Yuri Topolov version of Gargoyle appeared in the Hulk segment of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]''. Although he was called the Gorgon and not the Gargoyle in the TV version of the comic.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}
* The Yuri Topolov version of Gargoyle appeared in the 1996 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]. Gargoyle is always trying to find a cure for his mutation even allying himself with [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. In the episode "Mortal Bounds," he accidentally released a gamma virus (infecting amongst others [[Betty Ross]]) in his search for a cure where he was restored to a near normal state yet also infected. When Betty Ross was dying from the virus, Gargoyle gave Bruce Banner the antidote as Gargoyle is also cured. Before leaving, Gargoyle warns Banner that the next time they met he would not be so favorable. His position with Leader was one of grudging subservience, although he did become the dominant member when Leader temporarily lost his powers at the beginning of the second season. From then on like [[MODOK]] in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' cartoon, he became the bumbling [[comic relief]] with a crush on [[She-Hulk]].

===Video games===
* The Yuri Topolov version of Gargoyle appears in ''[[Lego Marvel's Avengers]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
