==Fictional character biography==

===Rescue===
'''Angel Salvadore''' is fourteen years old when her [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutation]] first manifests, and she is driven out of her home by her abusive step-father. The following morning, she wakes up in a [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]. She emerges with a pair of insect wings. She is later captured by [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]], humans who harvest mutants for their body parts for their own use.<ref>[[Grant Morrison]] (w), [[Ethan van Sciver]] (p), "Germ Free Generation" (part 1), ''[[New X-Men]]'' 118 (November 2001)</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/07/19/comic-book-easter-eggs-new-sex-men-118-edition/ |title=Comic Book Easter Eggs – New "Se"X-Men #118 Edition! |author=Brian Cronin |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=July 19, 2011 |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=471 |title=Review: New X-Men #118 |author=Hilton Collins |work=UncannyXmen.Net |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}</ref> [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] rescues her from a mobile operating theater.

===Xavier Institute===
At first Angel does not fit in well, especially with [[Emma Frost]]. However, Emma takes Angel's attitude to be a challenge, instead opting to take Angel under her wing as a mentor and mold Angel into a sophisticated young woman. Angel later helps the X-Men fight the menace of [[Cassandra Nova]] by working with the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] and stealing needed [[DNA]] samples.<ref>[[Grant Morrison]] (w), ''[[New X-Men]]'' vol. 1 #122-126 (March–June 2002)</ref>

After accepting a bet to kiss [[Barnell Bohusk|Beak]],<ref>[[Grant Morrison]] (w), [[John Paul Leon]] (p), [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] (i) "Some Angels Falling", ''[[New X-Men]]'' vol. 1 #131 (October 2002)</ref> her classmate in the Xavier Institute's Special Class, Angel grows close to him, and they begin to see each other romantically and sexually.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8kNjcn8KsuUC&pg=PA176#v=onepage&q&f=false Mutants and Mystics: Science Fiction, Superhero Comics, and the Paranormal] by Jeffrey J. Kripal, p. 176</ref> Angel, Beak, and the other Special Class students are part of another confrontation with the U-Men, deep in the woods on the Xavier Mansion grounds. Angel is the only one to see [[Xorn]] brutally murder the U-Men. He convinces her to keep it their secret by bribing her with candy.<ref>[[Grant Morrison]] (w), [[Frank Quitely]] (p), ''[[New X-Men]]'' vol. 1 #135-136 (February–March 2003)</ref>

Emma and Angel's relationship deepens after Emma and the Stepford Cuckoos come to differences. During a shopping spree, Angel tries to tell a distracted Emma that she is pregnant. Angel and Beak's efforts are recognized in an awards ceremony held by the Institute. The two sneak outside, not realizing they had any chance of winning, and Angel reveals to Beak she is pregnant, fearing that Emma will have them expelled.<ref>[[Grant Morrison]] (w), Frank Quitely (p), "The Prime of Miss Emma Frost", ''[[New X-Men]]'' vol. 1 #138 (May 2003)</ref> Due to her fly morphology, her pregnancy rate is accelerated, and she lays insect-like eggs in Wolverine's old shack. Her fear of their children being discovered and destroyed and of their possible expulsion make Angel a suspect in the "murder" of Emma Frost, who is found shattered in her diamond form by a diamond bullet.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=npIsZV7grboC&pg=PA106#v=onepage&q&f=false Marvel graphic novels and related publications: an annotated guide to comics, prose novels, children's books, articles, criticism and reference works, 1965-2005] by Robert G. Weiner, p. 125</ref> Angel is cleared of those suspicions when Emma is revived and names Esme as the perpetrator. In actuality, Esme had taken telepathic control of Angel.

Despite Angel and Beak's fears, the X-Men welcome their children, who look mostly human but with some of Angel's fly characteristics (such as insect-like wings) or Beak's chicken morphology (such as feathers or a beak).

===Xorn's Brotherhood and later===
Shortly afterwards, [[Xorn]], instructor of the Special Class, apparently reveals himself to be the mutant [[Terrorism|terrorist]] [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] (later his true identity is retrospectively revised). He has been responsible for corrupting Esme, and he has been teaching the class pro-Magneto propaganda under the guise of Xorn all along.

Angel is convinced to serve as a member of his latest incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. The school is demolished and conquered. Manhattan itself is taken over by Magneto. Angel and her children come along as part of the Brotherhood. Beak rebels early on, not wanting to see captured humans killed. Beak is seemingly killed for his efforts, dropped from a levitating car. He survives and joins with the X-Men. Angel herself feels the need to rebel when Magneto threatens her classmate Martha. Beak leads the X-Men back to Magneto's stronghold, using the key nobody had bothered to take from him before he was attacked. Magneto/Xorn is swiftly defeated and decapitated by Wolverine.

Later, Beak is made an honorary X-Man, and he, Angel, and their children lived in a home on the Xavier property. Beak is unhinged from time and joins the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], ostensibly to prepare him for a future event during which several worlds will be threatened. As a result of this displacement, he is for a time unable to interact with beings from his home timeline, and Angel and their family believed him to have run away. Only by serving with the Exiles could he win them back.<ref>''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' vol. 1 #48 (August 2004)</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=2070 |title=Review: Exiles #48 |author=Mandeep Jangi |work=UncannyXmen.Net |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=npIsZV7grboC&pg=PA106#v=onepage&q&f=false Marvel graphic novels and related publications: an annotated guide to comics, prose novels, children's books, articles, criticism and reference works, 1965-2005] by Robert G. Weiner, p. 106</ref> According to a 2010 retcon, during this time period Angel served as a member of Beast's squad of X-Men trainees, the Exemplars Squad, though the identities of her teammates are currently unknown.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' vol. 13 (2010)</ref>

Following the [[House of M]] event, Angel, Beak (thanks to the Exiles now back to his base reality) and their children (except Tito) lose their powers & unusual appearance and are now able to live happily together once more.<ref>''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' vol. 1 #71</ref>

===New Warriors===
Angel and Beak later resurface as members of the [[New Warriors]]. Now going by the name Tempest, Angel has gained fire, ice, and wind/flight powers given to her through technological means by [[Night Thrasher]].<ref>''[[New Warriors]]'' vol. 4 #4</ref> Angel and Beak have an apartment and are still in custody of their six children.
