'''Abner Ronald Jenkins''', also known as the '''[[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]]''', '''MACH-1''', '''MACH-2''', '''MACH-3''', <!--He switched to Roman numerals only with 4, that's not a typo--> '''MACH-IV''', '''MACH-V''', '''MACH-VII''' and  '''MACH-X''', is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He made his debut as the Beetle in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123 (August 1964) (where the character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] artist [[Carl Burgos]]) and later first appeared as MACH-1 in ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' #449 (January 1997) during the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]' debut.

Jenkins started out as a gifted aircraft mechanic but grew frustrated with his boring, low paying job and created an armor plated, mechanical suit and embarked on a criminal career as the "Beetle". On his first heist he was defeated by [[Human Torch]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] from the [[Fantastic Four]]. He would later become a regular foe of [[Spider-Man]], often as he worked as a henchman for various criminal organizations. Jenkins later organized his own group of criminals known as the [[Sinister Syndicate]].

When a large number of costumed heroes seemingly died in a battle against [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], [[Helmut Zemo]] recruited Jenkins and a number of other villains he had worked with in the past to form the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. All members adopted new costumed identities, posing as super heroes to gain access to the technology of the [[Fantastic Four]] or the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], groups which had both seemingly perished. Jenkins became known as "Mach-1", using a modified version of his Beetle armor that was designed for faster flight and higher altitude. While the plan was originally to steal technology most of the members decided that they enjoyed the attention and adulation and decided to legitimately become heroes. Jenkins was convinced to give himself over to authorities to serve out an outstanding prison sentence in exchange for the Thunderbolts being granted immunity. During his time in jail Jenkins helped the authorities out, which led to him working for the government after his release from prison. He later began working at the Raft maximum security prison as head of security and worked with the Thunderbolts, who were now a team of criminals who tried to earn time off their sentence by carrying out missions for the government.

==Fictional character biography==
<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Spider-Man Web of Doom 3.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Abner Jenkins in his second Beetle armor as seen in ''Spider-Man: Web of Doom'' #3.<br/>Art by [[Shawn McManus]].]] -->
Abner Jenkins was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

===Criminal career===
Abner Jenkins was a master mechanic at an aircraft parts factory who became dissatisfied with his boring, low paying job. Using his considerable mechanical knowledge, Jenkins built an armor-plated, strength-augmenting suit, a pair of gravity-defying wings, suction-fingered gloves, and a [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] control helmet. Calling himself the "[[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]]", Jenkins decided to use his battle-suit for fame, wealth, and adventure. Believing a victory over half the [[Fantastic Four]] would make him an overnight sensation, the Beetle chose to lure the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] into battle. However, Thing and Human Torch defeated him, and he was sent to prison.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #123</ref>

Paroled a short time later, he sought revenge on Human Torch, but found himself in battle with [[Spider-Man]] instead. He kidnapped Human Torch's girlfriend, and Human Torch briefly battled Spider-Man, thinking he was in league with Beetle. Once again, with Human Torch's help, he was defeated after a cage of high-temperature flame was created around him. He was jailed once more.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #21</ref> Upon his release, he decided to forego petty revenge and concentrated on the acquisition of wealth. At one point, Beetle was mentally dominated and recruited by the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] to serve as his unwilling agent. Under the Collector's domination, Beetle faced the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #27-28</ref> He battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]<ref>''Daredevil'' #33-34</ref> and then, allied with [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], fought him again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #140</ref> The Beetle also battled Spider-Man again.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #16</ref>

He later became a member of the group of supervillains who briefly posed as the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] in order to confuse the authorities and earn a bit of public trust.<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 1 #63-65</ref>

Losing every battle against costumed crime-fighters and failing to accumulate very much wealth, Beetle offered his services to underworld financier [[Justin Hammer]] who kept various superhuman criminals on retainers. His offer accepted, Beetle was dispatched against the original [[Iron Man]], as part of a battalion of costumed criminals. His Beetle armor was severely damaged by Iron Man during the fight.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #127</ref>

Abner then invested all of the capital he could acquire into the modification and refinement of his Beetle armor. With the [[Tinkerer]]'s assistance, he produced a new battle-suit with far greater capacities than his old one. Before launching his comeback, Beetle recruited the criminal [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]] to put Spider-Man through his paces. Beetle wished to study Spider-Man's fighting style and program it into a computer system so he could anticipate his opponent's moves. Despite his preparations and new battle-suit, Beetle was again defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #58-60</ref>  He was later freed from prison by [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] who recruited him for his [[Masters of Evil]] organization. Beetle and other Masters of Evil were defeated by the Avengers and arrested.<ref>''Avengers'' #228-229</ref>

Justin Hammer then commissioned Beetle, [[Blizzard (Donnie Gill)|Blizzard II]] and [[Blacklash]] to kill [[Force (comics)|Clayton Wilson]], but Iron Man defeated them.<ref>''Iron Man'' #223-224</ref> Soon thereafter, Beetle battled Iron Man again, but this time all portions of the Beetle's battle armor using Stark technology were fused.<ref>''Iron Man'' #227</ref>

Beetle organized his own team of super-villainous mercenaries called the [[Sinister Syndicate]], which ran afoul of Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #280-281</ref><ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1</ref>

===As a member of the Thunderbolts===
When most of [[Earth]]'s costumed adventurers, including the then-core membership of the Avengers and Fantastic Four, seemingly died battling [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] recruited Jenkins and a number of other villains to trick the world into believing they were heroes called the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Jenkins adopted the guise of "MACH-1".{{issue|date=January 2017}} He was the first member of the team to do something because it was right rather than because it benefited the plan, providing Spider-Man with evidence to clear his name after an android framed the web-swinger for a series of thefts after the two were forced to fight the rest of the Thunderbolts under mind-control and Spider-Man saved Jenkins' life.<ref>''Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7</ref> Zemo's plan ultimately failed, but when Jenkins and other members began to enjoy the adulation and personal satisfaction from being heroes, they decided to try making the Thunderbolts a legitimate team. When [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] took over the group's leadership, he convinced Jenkins to serve out the remainder of his prison term as a show of good faith to the public, but another criminal used the Beetle guise to frame him. While at Seagate, Jenkins coped with resentment and occasional assaults from other super-criminals and refused a chance to participate in a mass escape organized by his old employer Justin Hammer. Instead, Jenkins foiled the breakout, an act which brought him to the attention of the government's [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] (CSA). They recruited Jenkins to participate in a sting operation aimed at Hammer. Jenkins agreed, using a newly designed armor to operate as the Beetle once more. The activities of the new Beetle attracted the attention of the Thunderbolts. Fearing the CSA might not honor the terms of their bargain, Jenkins fled CSA custody after completing the operation and rejoined the Thunderbolts. Hawkeye [[blackmail]]ed the CSA into allowing Jenkins to remain free, even though the government's records would list Jenkins as still being in prison, in exchange for keeping the CSA's exploitation of Jenkins's secret.{{issue|date=December 2016}}

Jenkins created the "MACH-2" battle-suit after modifying his MACH-1 armor with the aid of Techno.{{issue|date=December 2016}} Techno also altered Jenkins's physical appearance using "dermaplasty" technology since the public was not supposed to know MACH-2 was Jenkins, and the mischievous Techno had some fun at Jenkins's expense by giving him the features of an [[African American]].{{issue|date=December 2016}}

When the Thunderbolts uncovered and thwarted a CSA-connected conspiracy to exterminate all superhumans, Hawkeye blackmailed the CSA into giving the Thunderbolts full pardons in exchange for the group's silence; however, CSA agent [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] insisted that he would not go along with the deal unless Hawkeye went to prison for his technically illegal [[vigilante]] activities as a member of the Thunderbolts. Hawkeye agreed, despite the protests of his teammates, and surrendered to federal custody. Most of the rest of the Thunderbolts, including MACH-2 and Songbird, were pardoned and released. However, as part of the terms of their deal, they were forbidden from public use of superhuman powers or costumed identities. MACH-2 and Songbird turned their equipment over to the authorities and started new civilian lives in the town of [[Burton Canyon]], [[Colorado]] as Abe Jenkins and Melissa Gold.{{issue|date=December 2016}}

Ironically, Jenkins found himself employment with the Burton Canyon [[police department]] as a [[tech support]] specialist. Unfortunately, their quiet lives were shattered when the super-criminal [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] launched his latest attempt at world conquest in Burton Canyon, imprisoning the world's superheroes and reshaping the planet in his own image. Despite their reluctance to risk their newfound freedom, Jenkins and Songbird agreed to join [[Citizen V]] (secretly Baron Zemo controlling Citizen V's body) in attacking Graviton as part of a new team of Thunderbolts. Jenkins was given new armor provided by Citizen V's financiers, the [[V-Battalion]], and called himself "MACH-3". Graviton was defeated and the world was saved, but MACH-3 and the other Thunderbolts disappeared in an implosion created by the dying Graviton's power, with the exception of Songbird who appeared left behind as the sole survivor.{{issue|date=December 2016}}

====On Counter-Earth====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
On [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], the team continued to band together, searching for a way to return to their own world and beginning to establish themselves as the leading superheroes of the troubled Counter-Earth.{{issue|date=December 2016}}

After a failed attempt to escape to the real Earth, the team entered into an uneasy alliance with their original leader, Baron Zemo, in an ongoing effort to save Counter-Earth from the various ills plaguing that alternate world. The Thunderbolts went on to revive the flying city of [[Attilan]] and populate it with refugees and survivors of the war-torn and nearly destroyed world. The Thunderbolts became renowned for their heroism and efforts to solve the world's problems. They were hailed by many to be the world's saviors. Nevertheless, Jenkins appeared to be going through the motions; his heart being elsewhere as his relationship with Songbird was thought to be lost.{{issue|date=December 2016}}

On Counter-Earth, Zemo's Thunderbolts had encountered the effects of a [[white hole]] spawned from an abandoned spacecraft, as its engine's [[radiation]] began eating Earth from the inside. The Thunderbolts embarked on a plan to combine their powers to punt the alien ship off the Earth and sever the link between the worlds. However, in order to complete this plan, the Thunderbolts needed to be inside the engine-spawned void in order to keep it clear of the real Earth as it closed. By so doing, they would reemerge from the void on the real Earth, forfeiting their roles and place on Counter-Earth. Emerging from the void, the Thunderbolts encountered their former teammates Hawkeye and Songbird who had formed their own version of the Thunderbolts who were similarly engaged with the void from the real Earth's counterpart of the spaceship. The two teams of Thunderbolts combined forces to plug the void and shunt the alien ship from Earth. Jenkins's reunion with Songbird was short-lived. Despite their feelings for each other, Jenkins left Songbird, once more remanding himself to police custody to serve the remainder of his sentence.{{issue|date=December 2016}}

====Back on Earth====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
For six months, Jenkins had been a model prisoner at Parsons Minimum Security prison in [[Illinois]]. He has since had his skin and face changed back to his original appearance, and has resumed contact with Songbird.  Abe was recently approached by the Avengers on finding if they had been staying legit despite their suspicions. Abe told them they would have to stop Baron Zemo before he launched Project: Liberation, but that [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] was the one to really worry about. After Moonstone revealed her plans, Abe had [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]] contacted to help the Avengers and Thunderbolts stop her.{{issue|date=December 2016}}

Following the conclusion to the battle, Abe was finally [[parole]]d from jail and made an announcement that he was reforming the Thunderbolts and that any former villains or super-powered individuals who wanted a second chance would be allowed to join. He found himself the group's leader and lover to Songbird. Things continued to go crazy when the Thunderbolts kept being put into tough situations as [[Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker]] threw new challenges to keep them busy, including adding [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] to the team as a spy and allowing [[Fathom Five (comics)|Fathom Five]] to attack [[New York City]]. Things finally came together when Abe revealed he always intended to take down Strucker. They succeeded in defeating [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]]'s scheme to destroy all of [[Manhattan]], but Strucker managed to escape.{{issue|date=December 2016}}

Jenkins and the Fixer help Songbird and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] escape from [[Norman Osborn]] and some [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] agents.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #134–136 (Oct. 2009–Nov. 2009)</ref>

Later, Mach-V works at The Raft as the Head of Security. He brings [[Luke Cage]] below sea level where they are introduced to [[Man-Thing]] who will serve as the Thunderbolts' mode of transportation.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #144</ref>

During the [[Avengers: Standoff!|Standoff at Pleasant Hill]], MACH-VII is working with S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #8</ref><ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega'' #1</ref> Afterward, MACH-VII became MACH-X and joined with Winter Soldier's new team of Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Abner Jenkins has no superhuman powers, but has extensive knowledge of mechanics and engineering.

As the Beetle, he designed and wore a suit of full body [[powered armor]] that granted him superhuman strength and durability and artificial winged flight. The suit's gloves contained pneumatic suction-grippers, enabling him to cling to walls or lift things with his fingertips. The suit could also create an electrostatic energy discharge referred to as the "electro-bite". On the back of the suit are a set of ultra-tough mylar wings powered by super efficient micro-motors which enable him to fly. Antennae built into the suit's helmet allowed reception and ultra-efficient conversion of microwaves, providing the suit with a constantly replenishing power supply. A mini-computer built into the chest-plate feeds data to [[Head-up display|heads-up]] displays in the helmet, providing him with constantly updated tactical analysis of his opponent's movements.

As MACH-I through MACH-IV, he designed a new suit of power armor which granted superhuman strength and durability, and flight as his Beetle suit did. This new suit contains a variety of different weapon systems, however, instead of the insect-themed powers of the previous armor.

===Old Man Logan===
An older Abner Jenkins appears in Old Man Hawkeye, a prequel to ''[[Old Man Logan]]''.

Years later, Jenkins is now working in a Doombot factory in Kree Haven before Hawkeye arrives to kill him for revenge for his betrayal. Clint allows him to put on his Beetle outfit (which Abner chose because he did not find it fitting to dress up as the heroic Mach-X) and tells Clint that he sided with the Thunderbolts against the Avengers to protect Songbird. Clint kills him and takes his final love note to Songbird.<ref>''Old Man Hawkeye'' #4</ref>
