'''James Proudstar''', known first as '''Thunderbird''' and then as '''Warpath''', is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Proudstar first appeared as the second Thunderbird in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #16 ([[1984 in comics#June|June 1984]]).<ref name=Marvel-Warpath/>

Originally blaming the X-Men for the death of his brother, [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], he joined the [[supervillain|villainous]] [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]] group to get revenge. He later reconsidered his views and became a longtime member of the militant X-Men offshoot [[X-Force]]. After a long journey to the Shi'ar Empire with the [[Uncanny X-Men]], Warpath became a member of the new incarnation of X-Force, but he left after the events of [[Necrosha]].

An [[Apache]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], Proudstar possesses [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] superhuman strength and speed. His powers resemble those of his older brother, the short-lived X-Men member [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], although Warpath's power-levels are much higher. Warpath is one of the few mutants to retain his powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]].

Warpath appeared in the 2014 film, ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', portrayed by [[Booboo Stewart]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
James Proudstar was born on the Apache reservation at [[Camp Verde, Arizona]].<ref name=Marvel-Warpath/>

He has one older brother, John. John is a mutant superhero: [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]] with the [[X-Men]]. John is killed on one of the team's missions,<ref>''X-Men'' #95 (October 1975)</ref> and James blames the X-Men's founder, [[Professor X]], for his brother's joining the X-Men.

===Thunderbird===
Seeking revenge for his brother's death, James is recruited for [[Emma Frost]]'s Hellions. As a Hellion, James clashes with the [[New Mutants]] and [[Kitty Pryde]], but to his chagrin, Frost feels they are not ready to take on the adult X-Men.<ref>''New Mutants'' #16-17</ref> James defies Frost's orders, dons his brother's costume, and kidnaps former X-Man [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] to draw the team to the [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex]], where John was killed. However, when the opportunity to kill Professor X arrives, James finds he has too many doubts about how John joined the X-Men. James is reconciled with the X-Men; Professor X offers him membership in the New Mutants, but he declines out of loyalty to his friends in the Hellions.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #193 (May 1985)</ref>

Months later, James leaves the Hellions and returns home to his family's [[Indian reservation|reservation]]. [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] makes him another offer to join the New Mutants but he turns it down. After a meeting in [[New York City]], James returns home to find his entire tribe murdered.

Sledge reveals to James that his enhanced senses would allow him to survive in this alternate dimension without going insane.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}  James locates and rescues the Vanisher, who is being held captive by natives of the Darkforce Dimension, and in turn Sledge gives information on one of his tribesman, Michael Whitecloud, whom James had presumed deceased.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #71</ref> Whitecloud tells him that [[Stryfe]], X-Force's adversary, was behind the killing of his tribe. James goes to [[Hell]] to gain revenge but is returned to the living world by [[Blackheart]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} When James finds out Risque's involvement, he ends their relationship.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

==Powers and abilities==

===Physical characteristics===
Warpath is {{convert|7|ft|2|in|m}} in height and weighs {{convert|350|lb|kg}}.<ref name=Marvel-Warpath/>

===Physical capabilities===
Warpath is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses superhuman physical ability in virtually all areas.

He possesses superhuman strength. The air pressure from one of his claps causes a Sentinel to collapse.<ref>"Uncanny X-Men" #493</ref> He has even managed to hold his own in a direct fight against the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>''X-Force'' #3</ref>

He possesses superhuman resistance to injury, at least enough to withstand short-range gunfire,<ref>''X-Force'' #115</ref> grenade explosions,<ref>''Deadpool'' #11</ref> and direct telekinetic attack from [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]].<ref>''X-Force'' vol 1 #25 (August 1993)</ref> He also repairs and regenerates damaged and destroyed tissue much faster than a normal human,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} as well as revives and recuperates from exhaustion and fatigue much faster than a normal human.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

He possesses superhuman agility and flexibility. He can "move with the grace an [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold-medalist]] would envy"<ref>''X-Force'' #65</ref> and "swim with the ease of a [[porpoise]]."<ref>''X-Force'' #81</ref>

His power of flight was discovered by his one-time mentor and team leader [[Peter Wisdom]], who analyzed his mutation after the [[High Evolutionary]] devolved and re-evolved all mutants on Earth, and Wisdom forced James to incorporate this ability in his fighting style.<ref>''X-Force'' #104</ref> This power was ignored for a while, as writer [[Ed Brubaker]] did not understand how Warpath's speed and strength would allow it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, Warpath's fighting style in the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]'' storyline showed his flight powers,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #493</ref> and ''X-Force'' shows him flying for long distances.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} It has since been suggested by writer [[Christopher Yost]] that Warpath felt "rather embarrassed by the whole flying thing."<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/15/fraction-joins-brubaker-on-uncanny | title = Fraction Joins Brubaker On Uncanny, Plus more news from the Marvel's X-Men panel | first = Richard | last = George | date = March 15, 2008 | accessdate = January 30, 2014 | publisher = IGN Entertainment}}</ref>

Warpath's senses – particularly [[Visual perception|sight]], [[Olfaction|smell]], and [[hearing]] – are enhanced to levels beyond the capabilities of a normal human. He is able to see with perfect clarity at much greater distances than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol. #51</ref> His hearing is similarly heightened, enabling him to clearly hear sounds beyond the range of ordinary human hearing and to hear sounds that they can detect but at much greater distances.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

After nearly getting killed by [[Reignfire]],{{issue|date=September 2013}} Warpath experienced an increase in senses and speed that allowed him to perform feats he had previously not been aware he was capable of. For example, he can run at high speeds up to at least {{convert|150|km/h|mph}} for long distances and quickly climb building walls by digging his hands and feet into the bare concrete.<ref>''X-Force'' #51</ref> He can even evade weapon fire with rapid reflexes and reactions.<ref>''X-Force'' #94</ref>

In new publishing coinciding along Marvel's new ''ResurrXion'' event, Warpath has showcased regenerative abilities able to recover from mild to serious injuries inflicted upon him by new [[Weapon X]] cyborgs.<ref>''Weapon X'' Vol 3 #2</ref>

===Training===
Warpath is well versed in [[hand-to-hand combat]], which is enhanced by his superhuman reflex/reaction rate and eye/ear-hand/foot coordination. He was trained in [[unarmed combat]] under the guidance of [[Emma Frost]]. He gained extensive training in the use of the [[Quarterstaff|staff]] by his long-time teammate [[Shatterstar]], whom he eventually matched in a record time of only a dozen tries.<ref>''X-Force'' #52</ref> He wields a pair of [[Bowie knife|bowie knives]] composed of [[vibranium]], given to him by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #475</ref> with which he has proved to be highly proficient.

James is also a skilled [[hunter]] and [[Tracking (hunting)|tracker]] in his native [[Apache]] tradition.

===Supernatural capabilities===
Ghost Rider activated limited Apache [[shaman]] abilities within James, in order to help him fight the Demon Bear. He could perceive the creature's wounds and the resulting spirit energy when it was destroyed.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #10</ref>

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the ''[[Ultimate Comics: X-Men]]'' storyline, James Proudstar is a member of the mutant liberation in the Southwest.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #18</ref>

===What If===
James Proudstar appears in the ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' story "What If the X-Men Died on their First Mission?" Following the death of his brother and the X-Men on [[Krakoa]], he joins [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'s hastily assembled mutant team – consisting of himself, [[Siryn|Theresa Cassidy]] (who named herself Banshee in honor of her [[Banshee (comics)|late father]]), [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair]], [[Namorita]], [[Scarlet Witch]], and her brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] – to combat [[Count Nefaria]] and his [[Ani-Men]]. Initially James joined only to kill [[Professor X]], whom he held responsible for [[Thunderbird (comics)|his brother]]'s death. However, he avoids John's fate in the mainstream comics and, finally acknowledging that his brother laid down his life in order to save others, joins the new X-Men team afterwards.<ref>''What If'' vol. 2 #9 (1990)</ref>

==In other media==
* Warpath appears in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', portrayed by [[Booboo Stewart]].<ref>{{citation | url = https://twitter.com/BryanSinger/status/327037468673208320 | first = Bryan | last = Singer | date = 24 April 2013 | publisher = Twitter | title = Every mutant needs a place to sit #XMen #DaysOfFuturePast}}</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://splashpage.mtv.com/2013/08/08/x-men-days-of-future-past-footage-leaked/ | title = 'X-Men: Days Of Future Past' Footage Leaks, Shows Bishop, Warpath, Sunspot And More | date = 8 August 2013 | first = Brett | last = White | publisher = Splash Page}}</ref> In this interpretation, he wields his signature bowie knives and displays acute senses, enhanced strength and superhuman athleticism and reflexes, picking up the Sentinels first out of the remaining X-Men. At the beginning of the film, Warpath attempts to stall the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] so [[Kitty Pryde|Kitty]] and [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] could change the past. Taking his final stand, he rushes at an awaiting Sentinel but is obliterated when it uses its energy blast. While stalling the Sentinels so [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] could change the timeline, he is executed by a Sentinel burning his face off. These events are later erased by the altering of the timeline.
