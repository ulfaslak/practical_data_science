==Fictional character biography==
===Heroic Green Goblin===
Phil Urich, nephew of [[Ben Urich]] of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', stumbles upon one of [[Harry Osborn]]'s old [[Green Goblin]] hideouts. Using a mask that delivers a "zap" gives him Goblin-level strength without the psychotic side-effects of the original Goblin formula, and he gains enhanced strength and endurance.<ref>''Green Goblin'' #1 (Oct. 1995)</ref> He tries to gain a reputation as a [[superhero]] following the death of [[Harry Osborn]], son of the original Green Goblin. However, he is sometimes seen as being as maniacal as his villainous predecessors. His equipment is damaged during a battle against a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] in the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crossover; Urich sacrifices his glider to destroy a Sentinel by ramming the robot in the head, but a fragment of metal ricochets off the explosion and damages his mask's circuitry.<ref>''Green Goblin'' #12 (Sep. 1999)</ref> Urich is unable to repair or replace it and retires from being the Green Goblin.<ref name="GG13">''Green Goblin'' #13 (Oct. 1996)</ref>

Phil later forms a [[Loners (comics)|superhero self-help group]] with [[Turbo (comics)|Mickey Musashi]] in order to prevent teenagers from becoming superheroes, and to help young former superheroes get over their pasts, attempting to convince them and others that their powers had damaged their lives.<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #1-6 (April - Sep. 2005)</ref> His intentions are pure, but he accepts funds from a secret benefactor to rescue the Runaways during the [[List of Runaways story arcs#True Believers|"True Believers" story arc]]. The groups vows to only don their uniform one last time and help the Runaways defeat an Ultron clone. The team vows not to use their powers again, but [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] secretly uncovers a MGH drug ring. This leads to [[Nekra]] attacking the group during one of their counseling sessions.<ref>''The Loners'' #5 (Oct. 2007)</ref> Urich suffers a mental breakdown after watching [[Darkhawk|Chris Powell]] and Mickey share a celebratory kiss, having apparently convinced himself that he and Mickey had feelings for each other though she only saw him as a friend. He attacks Mickey and Chris and steals the Darkhawk amulet from Chris. The Loners join together to fight Urich, but he is able to escape with [[Penance (X-Men)|Hollow]].<ref>''The Loners'' #5-6 (Oct. 2007, Jan. 2008)</ref>

===Villainous Hobgoblin===
[[File:Hobgoblin (Phil Urich).png|thumb|upright|Urich as Hobgoblin; art by Stefano Caselli.]]
Urich is next seen in the ''[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]'' storyline in New York helping out his uncle at the new [[Daily Bugle|Front Line]] offices. He develops a crush on co-worker [[Norah Winters]], who is looking into "Goblin Gangs" for a story. Urich goes to one of the old Goblin hideouts, hoping to find something there to impress her. He encounters Daniel Kingsley (posing as his brother [[Roderick Kingsley]],<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #691 (Aug. 2012)</ref> the original [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]) who is also looking for some new Goblin technology.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648 (Nov. 2010)</ref> Kingsley is about to kill him when Urich snaps and uses his Lunatic Laugh to incapacitate the Hobgoblin. Using the fire sword that Kingsley had just found, Urich decapitates Kingsley and steals the new Green Goblin equipment from Osborn's secret lair. Urich then assumes the Hobgoblin identity for himself. Now operating as a villain, he attacks a local [[think tank]], and is confronted by [[Spider-Man]] who save [[Max Modell]] from being attacked by Hobgoblin.<ref name="ASM649">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #649 (Dec. 2010)</ref> Catching the hero off-guard with his Goblin laugh, Urich tries to decapitate him. Bella Fishback, one of the workers at the think tank, is able to disrupt the sonic waves to save Spider-Man, but Urich escapes with the Reverbium he had come to steal. He delivers the metal to the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] and becomes one of his operatives.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #650 (Dec. 2010)</ref> Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] fight Urich and the Kingpin to retrieve the experimental metal. During the fight, Urich's Lunatic Laugh causes the building to collapse, and he saves the Kingpin from falling to his death.<ref name="ASM651">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #651 (Jan. 2011)</ref>

Urich gives Norah tips about possible Hobgoblin sightings so they can [[Stakeout|spy together]] in an attempt to woo her away from [[Randy Robertson]]. Urich's jealousy of Randy also causes him to break a support beam when [[Alistair Smythe]]'s [[Spider-Slayer]]s attack the Front Line offices. This, along with the damage caused by the attack, causes the ceiling to collapse on Randy. Randy survives the collapse, but he is seriously injured.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654 (Feb. 2011)</ref> Urich, as the Hobgoblin, fights [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] after he defeats a gang that works for the Kingpin. His pumpkin bombs cause debris to fall on Hercules, who however escapes from the rubble. He then resumes the fight as the Hobgoblin films the fight with hidden cameras while airing the footage live. Hercules wins the fight, boosting his own popularity instead of Urich's, which was Urich's original intent. The Kingpin convinces Hercules not to hand him over to the authorities.<ref>''Herc'' #1-2 (April 2011)</ref> Urich attacks [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]] after Norah talks about how impressive she is; he wants to show Norah that he, as the Hobgoblin, is more impressive. He lures her to him by leaving a destructive path for her to follow. Spider-Girl almost defeats him, but Spider-Man intervenes after seeing what she is doing, believing she is still too inexperienced to fight such a powerful opponent. By doing this he causes the Hobgoblin to get away.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' vol. 2 #6 (April 2011)</ref> Urich finally breaks up Randy and Norah after he stalks and confronts them in his Hobgoblin persona. Urich then seduces Norah—who does not know the role he played in the breakup—and kisses her.<ref>''Spider-Island: Deadly Foes'' (Aug. 2011)</ref> Under orders from the Kingpin, Urich [[Team-up|teams up]] with Spider-Girl to fight the Sisterhood of the Wasp in ''[[Spider-Island]]''.<ref>''Spider-Island: Spider-Girl'' #1-3 (Aug. - Sep. 2011)</ref> Urich infiltrates a prisoner transport headed to The Raft to kill the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]] for stealing money from the Kingpin. On the transport, he encounters [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] and fights with him. The fight results in a stalemate and the Human Fly escapes.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #16 (April 2012)</ref>

During a confrontation with Spider-Man, Hobgoblin uses a weapon designed to disrupt Spider-Man's spider-sense. Although it initially appears to have failed, Peter later realizes that it has intensified his spider-sense, causing it to react to the most minor of threats. Peter's mental state, along with a wrongly delivered message from Madame Web, allows Urich to capture him while he was still dazed.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #695 (Oct. 2012)</ref>

Peter later finds out that Urich and Kingpin have not discovered his secret identity when Urich refers to Peter as "Spider-Man's best friend". Urich and Kingpin try to get Peter to tell them who Spider-Man is but fail. Meanwhile, [[Roderick Kingsley]] gets dressed in his old costume to go searching for him. While Kingsley engages Urich, [[Max Modell]] helps Peter escape. Peter, using his webshooters, breaks the disruptor weapon and escapes.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #696 (Oct. 2012)</ref> Kingpin then orders the two Hobgoblins after him. Both Hobgoblins end up fighting Spider-Man but ultimately give up as Roderick Kingsley decides to just kill Urich instead. He however ends up changing his mind at the last moment, letting him retain his identity as Hobgoblin, on the condition that he gives Kingsley a cut of the profits he makes. Urich reluctantly agrees to the arrangement but quickly begins to conspire to kill Kingsley.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #697 (Nov. 2012)</ref> When Mayor [[J. Jonah Jameson]] announces an effort to crack down on supervillains, Urich debates whether it is worthwhile to remain Hobgoblin while paying a lot of money to the [[Tinkerer]] for his Hobgoblin gear and to Kingsley for being allowed to be Hobgoblin.<ref>''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' #6</ref>

===Goblin Knight===
When [[The Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Spider-Man's body) raids [[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]], Hobgoblin is left to fend for himself while Kingpin escapes. Hobgoblin escapes, encountering Spider-Bots which do not detect him.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #14</ref> Following the assault on Shadowland, Hobgoblin goes to [[Tinkerer]] and requests upgrades to his gear in order to survive Superior Spider-Man's aggressive campaign. Tiberius Stone (hiding under the Tinkerer) does the upgrades, planning revenge for Hobgoblin's ruining him while working for Kingpin. When Superior Spider-Man finally confronts Hobgoblin, his tech fails as a result of Tiberius Stone's revenge. He escapes, but not before Superior Spider-Man manages to put tracers deep enough into Urich's skin to hear his name over the transmitters. He then publicly reveals Urich as Hobgoblin at the Daily Bugle. Urich, seeing the feeds, realizes that he has nowhere left to run.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #15</ref> With his identity as Hobgoblin revealed to the public, Urich desperately makes excuses as his Daily Bugle co-workers turn against him. Superior Spider-Man, learning Urich's location, arrives at the Daily Bugle and fights with an unstable Urich and disarms him. He seems to consider giving Urich a public execution, but Urich is freed from a prison transport by [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]] and brought to Green Goblin who upgrades his armor and weapons. The [[Norman Osborn|Goblin King]] asks only for full dedication to Urich's only identity from then on as the '''Goblin Knight'''.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #16</ref> Goblin King trains Goblin Knight, who is anxious to jump into action against Superior Spider-Man. Goblin King reprimands Goblin Knight for causing him to shut down his Goblin Protocols to avoid detection by Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #17</ref> When Monster and Menace attack Roderick Kingsley's henchmen [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], [[Steeplejack (Marvel Comics)|Steeplejack]], and [[Tumbler (comics)|Tumbler]], Goblin Knight kills Steeplejack.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #25</ref> Goblin Knight (alongside other Goblin Knights) was with the Goblin King when he fought (and killed) Hobgoblin. Later on, Goblin Knight checks the body to see if it was Roderick Kingsley underneath the mask. He discovers that it is actually Roderick Kingsley's butler, Claude, who died. Goblin Knight then destroys the body to ensure that Goblin King never suspects that Kingsley is still alive.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #26</ref> Learning of his nephew's identity, Ben Urich attempts to arrange a meeting to talk Phil down and convince him to accept a cure for the Goblin formula. But when Robbie Robertson is discovered in the area, Phil believes that Ben had been trying to set a trap and delivers a serious injury to Robbie before Spider-Man appears. Urich is able to get away when Ben convinces Superior Spider-Man to take Robbie to hospital, but Ben makes it clear that he has no interest in protecting Urich, acknowledging that Urich liked what he had become and was uninterested in redemption or help.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' Annual #2</ref>

===Goblin King===
Following the conclusion of ''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' storyline, the true Spider-Man returns. Phil Urich now leads the remnants of the Goblin Nation as the self-proclaimed '''Goblin King'''. Goblin King meets with [[Mister Negative]] where they wait for [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] to show up in order to divide the criminal underground following Norman Osborn's defeat. The meeting is crashed by Black Cat and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. Black Cat mentions to Goblin King and Mister Negative that Spider-Man had outed them and wants a share in their plans.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #5</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Goblin King attempts to rescue Lily Hollister from a police transport. This mission goes awry and Lily is rendered amnesiac.<ref>''AXIS: Hobgoblin'' #1</ref> When Goblin King confronts Roderick Kingsley in his headquarters, Queen Cat comes to his defense. Goblin King recognizes Lily Hollister as Queen Cat, but she does not recognize him. Following the attack, Missile Mate is convinced by Urich that the Hobgoblin would soon abandon the heroes he had trained. Missile Mate goes to the Goblin Nation's headquarters and asks Goblin King to join him and become a supervillain. Goblin King is reluctant, but Missile Mate shows him that he has also gathered all the supervillains that Hobgoblin had "abandoned" (consisting of [[8-Ball (comics)|8-Ball]] III, [[Killer Shrike]] II, [[Melter]] III, [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]] II, and [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]] IV) after becoming a good guy.<ref>''AXIS: Hobgoblin'' #2</ref> While the celebration of Hobgoblin Day is being held with a parade in Roderick Kingsley's honor, Missile Mate betrays Hobgoblin and attempts to murder him in the name of the Goblin King. Roderick, however, had already expected the betrayal and had been using a hologram decoy which took Missile Mate's blow. As soon as Roderick Kinglsey confronts Missile Mate, the Goblin King appears with his Goblin Nation and attacks the celebration. Hobgoblin bests Goblin King in combat and delivers him and the Goblin Nation members with him to the authorities.<ref>''AXIS: Hobgoblin'' #3</ref>

Having escaped prison under undisclosed circumstances during the "[[Go Down Swinging (comics)|Go Down Swinging]]" storyline, Urich raids one of Norman Osborn's old gentlemen's clubs to acquire the Goblin weaponry Osborn stored there, but Osborn- currently wielding the power of the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] after Octavius's cure prevents Osborn acquiring his powers- apparently kills Urich by tearing his heart out.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #797</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===As Green Goblin===
Due to ingestion of a modified version of [[Norman Osborn]]'s "Goblin Formula", Phil Urich gains superhuman strength (able to lift upwards of 9 tons), stamina, durability, speed, and reflexes. However, he is unable to access these abilities without the unknown catalyst provided by the Goblin mask he wears. He also possesses a so-called "Lunatic Laugh" capable of creating sound waves disorienting to most people. It is possible that the formula also increased his intelligence since he has shown to have an unusual cleverness when it came to strategy and modifying his equipment, as the Goblin formula had done for other users.<ref>''Green Goblin'' #2 (Nov. 1995)</ref> Whether or not he needed the mask for this was unknown.

As the Goblin, Urich wears an alternate/spare Goblin costume composed of a chain-mail mesh capable of deflecting small arms fire. He travels on a bat-shaped, one-man, rocket-propelled "[[Green Goblin#Goblin Glider|Goblin Glider]]." Like other Goblins' gliders, it is armed with heat-seeking missiles, machine guns, and retractable blades. Other weapons Urich typically uses are incendiary Pumpkin Bombs capable of melting through {{convert|3|in|mm}} of steel, smoke and gas-emitting bombs with an appearance like a ghost, razor-edged bat-shaped boomerangs and gloves woven with micro-circuited filaments capable of discharging nearly 1,000 volts of electricity.<ref>''Green Goblin'' #2 - 12 (Nov. 1995 - Sep. 1996)</ref> Most of this equipment was completely destroyed or rendered inoperable during Urich's final battle with the Sentinel.<ref name="GG13"/>

===As Hobgoblin===
<!-- This section is for a description of his POWERS and ABILITIES so a repeat of the story is inappropriate here. -->
As the Hobgoblin, Phil Urich wears an orange Hobgoblin costume with wings on the back that allow him to fly without the use of a Goblin Glider and he took [[Roderick Kingsley]]'s mask as his own. He uses the traditional Pumpkin Bombs all Green Goblins and Hobgoblins before him have used, but he also has a new flaming sword.<ref name="ASM649"/> He still retains his "Lunatic Laugh" from when he was the Goblin and he also has superhuman strength, speed, durability, stamina, reflexes and senses, and enhanced intellect. For unknown reasons, he no longer needs his mask to activate this power. With the help of Reverbium, his "Lunatic Laugh" was able to cause a building to collapse.<ref name="ASM651"/>

==Other versions==
===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] timeline, Phil Urich marries his girlfriend Meredith and becomes a [[Forensics|forensic scientist]] and friend of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]. He is aware of both Peter and [[Spider-Girl]]'s identities. Phil Urich resumes the Goblin identity, first under the name of the Golden Goblin, then as the Green Goblin with the assistance of [[Normie Osborn]]. After Urich loses a long series of battles, Normie recreates Urich's original mask, which grants him superhuman strength and other abilities, greatly enhancing his effectiveness. He is also a founding member of the new [[New Warriors]].<!--not a redundant "new"! --><ref>''Spider-Girl'' vol. 1 #30 (March 2001)</ref>

While Urich originally required the technology in the Goblin mask to enhance his physical abilities, he retained one power that he is able to activate without the mask. Urich is capable of using his laughter as a sonic weapon of sorts. His "lunatic laugh" has been shown to disorient opponents and even shatter their eardrums. He once used the laugh while out of costume to defeat the Venom symbiote after it had taken possession of Peter.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' vol. 1 #5 (Feb. 1999)</ref>

==In other media==
The Phil Urich incarnation of Hobgoblin was added to the superhero [[tabletop game]] [[Heroclix]] in 2013.<ref>[http://heroclix.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/041b-Hobgoblin.jpg ]</ref>
