==Fictional character biography==
The son of Geoffrey and Catherine Wilder, Alex is the first character to be introduced to the series; Alex is the one to initially suggest spying on their parents' supposed charity organization. After witnessing their parents' (who were revealed to be a secret crime ring called "the Pride") murder of an innocent teenage girl, Alex organizes the mass escape from their parents.<ref name="Vol1#1"/><ref name="Vol1#2">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #2</ref> Alex then obtains [[The Yorkes|the Yorkes']] copy of The Abstract, a magical book that records the past, present, and future deeds of the Pride.<ref name="Vol1#3">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #3</ref> After a few fights with their parents, Alex and the Runaways escape to [[Chase Stein|Chase's]] dilapidated [[mansion]] hideout called "the Hostel".<ref name="Vol1#6">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #6</ref> The group vows to work together and take down their parents' organization.<ref name="Vol1#6"/> The majority of the group (with the exception of Alex) decide to take superhero codenames for themselves as they begin their new lives as full-time vigilantes.<ref name="Vol1#6"/>

Alex distances himself emotionally from many of the Runaways, even refusing to take a codename or bond with the rest of the team.<ref name="Vol1#6"/> Alex spends most of his time deciphering the Abstract, presumably plotting how he will carry out his plan to save his parents from the Dean and Hayes couples.<ref name="Vol1#7">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #7</ref> Since he expected that all the other Runaways would die in a few months time, he limited his emotional connection.<ref name="Vol1#17"/>

Alex eventually deciphers the Abstract and reveals that the Pride works for the [[Gibborim (comics)|Gibborim]], three monstrous [[giant (mythology)|giants]] who require the sacrifice of twenty-five innocent souls over twenty-five years to gain enough power to destroy Earth and restore it to the paradise it once was.<ref name="Vol1#13">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #13</ref> Alex determines the location for the yearly sacrificial [[rite]] and convinces the Runaways that the rite would be the best place to launch an assault.<ref name="Vol1#15">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #15</ref> Chase is critically injured, and decides to stay back, and gives Alex his [[x-ray]] goggles and Fistigons for the final fight.<ref name="Vol1#16">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #16</ref>

He reveals that he'd known about the Pride for over a year and had learned about the Pride's secret previously.<ref name="Vol1#17">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #17</ref> Alex then reveals that the Deans and Hayeses had plotted to kill all the human members of the Pride, and take the six seats in paradise for themselves and their daughters.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> Alex's master plan was to use his friends to take down the entire Pride as a group but save his own parents, thus securing three seats in the paradise the Gibborim had prophetically promised to the Pride previously for himself and his own parents selfishly, and to give the remaining three seats to [[Nico Minoru|Nico]] and her parents, but Nico refuses and Alex quickly loses control over the situation.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> Gert wakes up, prompting her to reclaim Old Lace, who steals back Nico's Staff and destroys the Fistigons, leaving Alex with nothing.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> When Molly awakens, she destroys the Gibborim's newest sacrifice; when the Gibborim arrive, Alex takes full responsibility in place of his father for the soul being gone.  While the Gibborim openly respect Alex's honesty, they promptly incinerate him.<ref name="Vol1#17"/>

Alex was the intended subject of two resurrection spells in the series' second volume. Nico reveals the reason why she couldn't resurrect [[Gertrude Yorkes]]' future self was because she had already attempted the spell. She says it didn't work because "even the Staff of One has its limits".<ref name="Vol2#2">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #2</ref>

In the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'', Alex was resurrected by [[Daimon Hellstrom]] to become Nico's teacher in battle strategy, and to help her cope with her increased [[Dark magic|dark magical powers]].<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #5</ref><ref name="Avengers Undercover #7">''Avengers Undercover'' #7</ref> When that series ended, Alex told her that he was bound to Hellstrom and joined the super-villainous team, [[Young Masters]].<ref name="Avengers Undercover #10">''Avengers Undercover'' #10</ref> Wilder reappeared in the pages of ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' throughout the second half of the 2016-2017 series. In that book, Alex set up shop in Harlem, attempting to restart the Pride by using mystical software to wipe out villains' police records and even spreading a demon drug called Redemption.<ref name="PowerManandIronFist">{{cite web |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/how-alex-wilder-betrayed-the-runaways?linkId=61957660 |title=How Alex Wilder Betrayed the Runaways |last=Dietsch |first=TJ |date=4 January 2019 |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=8 January 2019}}</ref> The [[Heroes For Hire]] didn't stand for that though, and put a stop to Wilder's schemes, exorcising his own demon, but leaving him relatively unharmed, leading to his reappearance at the ''Runaways'' hostel's doorstep with the children of Gibborim in tow.<ref name="PowerManandIronFist"/><ref name="vol5#12">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  [[Kris Anka]] | Colorist = [[Matt Wilson (comics artist)|Matt Wilson]] | Story = Best Friends Forever: Time After Time | Title = Runaways | Volume = 5 | Issue = 12 | Date = August 29, 2018 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref><ref name="vol5#13">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  [[David Lafuente]] | Colorist = [[Jim Campbell (comics)|Jim Campbell]] | Story = That Was Yesterday pt I | Title = Runaways | Volume = 5 | Issue = 13 | Date = September 12, 2018 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

However, despite the betrayal, Nico demonstrates willingness to forgive when she unsuccessfully tries to resurrect Alex, and states that even though Alex was a traitor, he did not deserve death.<ref name="Vol2#2"/> Also during volume one events in ''Mystic Arena'', it is also revealed that she still loves him and always will.<ref>''MYSTIC ARCANA: SISTER GRIMM'' #4</ref> During the events of ''Avengers Undercover'', Alex is resurrected by Hellstrom to become Nico's tutor in battle strategy.

Alex's relationship with his father is not strained, but also not the closest of relationships. Alex's obsession with superheroes never boded well with Geoffrey.<ref name="Vol1#1"/> It is revealed in volume one, issue seventeen, that Alex is devoted to his family above all, outing himself as the Pride's mole, a role he undertook solely to show that he is willing to go to great lengths to keep his parents safe.<ref name="Vol1#16"/> Alex explains in volume two, issue twenty-four, that he committed all of his evil actions to gain his father's approval and love, two things Geoffrey never explicitly demonstrated to Alex during the series.<ref name="Vol2#24">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #24</ref> In volume five, issue thirteen, Alex reemerged at the Hostel and reemphasized his decision to trade all of humanity, including his friends, to make his (and Nico’s) family immortal was based out of loyalty and protection for his parents.

As opposed to his comic book counterpart, he is much more optimistic, at least when it comes to hanging out with his friends, and his desires are more noble rather than selfish. He is also the one that invites them over to his house while the parents are away with his effort simply wanting to rebuild their broken relationship after the death of Nico's sister Amy, whose funeral Alex did not attend.<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[Reunion (Runaways)|Reunion]]|series=Marvel's Runaways|credits=Morgen, Brett (director); Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (writer)|network=[[Hulu]]|airdate=November 21, 2017|season=1|number=1}}</ref>
