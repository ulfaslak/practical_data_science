'''Kenneth Hale''' was a happy-go-lucky soldier of fortune. He was always risking his life for thrills, but he was actually afraid of dying. He heard of a local tribal legend from Africa that stated "If you kill the magical Gorilla-Man, you become immortal." He traveled to Africa to find the Gorilla-Man. Hale abandoned his goal at the last minute, but his encounter with the Gorilla-Man forced him to shoot. Hale then became immortal, but at the cost of becoming a Gorilla-Man himself. After operating his own team for a while, Hale retired, residing in a large treehouse near the Congo.<ref>''Men's Adventures'' #26 (March 1954). Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref>

'''Franz Radzik''', a scientist who created an electromagnetic ray machine to transfer his mind into a gorilla’s body was known as Gorilla-Man. He was sent into deep space on an experimental rocket ship and first appeared in ''Tales to Astonish'' (vol. 1) #28 and 30. The former story was reprinted in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #5. The latter in ''Gorilla Man #3''.

'''NOTE''': This is not to be confused with a story from ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #1. In it, a man who admires evil things is injected with a formula by an evil scientist which turns him into an ape, as he hopes to become a creature of evil. A student is knocked out by the evil man. He is tied to a chair and gagged at the home of the scientist. The mind of the man is sent back through the ages as he becomes an ape. However, the other man is able to free himself. He breaks the scientist's neck, but is captured and caged at the local zoo.

==Powers and abilities==
As Gorilla-Man, Hale possesses the body, and therefore the strength, agility, and endurance of a mountain gorilla, while still retaining his normal human intelligence. He is an expert in weapons usage with a preference for firearms, and was a skilled hand-to-hand fighter even as a human being. Gorilla-Man also has been cursed with immortality, thus he does not age and has retained the same level of strength and physical prowess over decades.

The Arthur Nagan version of Gorilla-Man is an expert transplant surgeon and inventor. His large gorilla body possesses strength, agility, dexterity, and endurance.

==Other versions==
In an alternate Earth that appears in ''Avengers Forever'' #4–5, a similar version of Hale as Gorilla-Man appeared in the Avengers of the 1950s.{{issue|date=August 2013}} However their timeline was destroyed by [[Immortus]].{{issue|date=August 2013}}
