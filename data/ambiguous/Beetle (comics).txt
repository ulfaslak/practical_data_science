The '''Beetle''' is the name used by multiple fictional [[character (arts)|characters]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It is also the name of the three versions of high tech armor used by seven separate characters.

==Publication history==

The Beetle debuted in the "Human Torch" segment of ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123 (August 1964) with the original incarnation [[Abner Jenkins]] using the first armor. This version was beaten by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Human Torch]]. This version would be used until the character switched to the second armor in ''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #59 (October 1981) (which is most associated with the name) and would be in use until ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #1 (April 1997) when Jenkins's alter ego was changed to MACH-1. A new version debuted in ''Thunderbolts'' #35 (February 2000). This version resembled a walking tank and would be used by Jenkins and the second incarnation [[Leila Davis]]. This version was crushed by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], killing Davis who was still inside at the time. After Davis's death, the Beetle armor would go unused until ''Thunderbolts'' #103 (August 2006) when all three versions were stolen and used by three college students. The individual names of these characters were not revealed in this initial appearance.

==Fictional character biography==

{{main|Abner Jenkins}}

An ex-master [[mechanic]], Abner Jenkins left his career to pursue life as an adventurer seeking wealth and fame under the Beetle name. A defeat at the [[Fantastic Four]]'s hands sent Beetle into the direction of a life of crime where he was even a member of the [[Masters of Evil]]. Years later, Jenkins joined the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a choice that eventually took him on a more heroic pathway in life.

Jonah Jameson]]'s campaign that exposes the mercenary's criminal dealings with various supervillains, such as helping [[MODOK]] out of prison and deals with [[Doctor Doom]].

While May manages to escape, Beetle is eventually beaten by Spider-Man and Coulson (with help from May). In the episode "Hawkeye", Beetle went to destroy the new S.H.I.E.L.D.

While Spider-Man deals with Taskmaster, Beetle is eventually defeated by Agent Venom. In the episode "New Warriors", Beetle is among the escaped supervillains along with Doctor Octopus, the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] and the Green Goblin during a showdown between Taskmaster's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|team]] and the [[New Warriors]]. Along with his fellow supervillains, Beetle is eventually defeated by the New Warriors.
