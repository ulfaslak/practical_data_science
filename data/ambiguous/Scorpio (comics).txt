'''Jacob''' "'''Jake'''" '''Fury''' was born in [[New York City]]. As a young man, he came to resent his brother [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #68</ref> As the original Scorpio, he operated as a spy, terrorist, and criminal. Using his secret identity as Scorpio, he first battled Nick at a Las Vegas [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] base.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> He again battled his brother in Manhattan, then disguised himself as Nick Fury to infiltrate the New York SHIELD base, although his real identity was then discovered by his brother.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD'' Vol. 1 #5</ref> Nick Fury later went undercover as Scorpio, and took his brother's place in the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], who battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #72</ref> Disguised as Jacque LaPoint, he played a minor role in the Zodiac's attempt to kill all Manhattan residents born under the sign of Gemini (save for Zodiac's Gemini).<ref>''Avengers'' #120-122</ref> He attempted to kidnap [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Kyle Richmond]], and battled the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #46</ref> Scorpio constructed a set of android Zodiac members to serve him, in his base at [[Belleville, New Jersey|Belleville]], [[New Jersey]]. However, his plan was thwarted by the Defenders, and he committed suicide through self-inflicted gunshot wound in despair.<ref>''Defenders'' #48-50</ref>

In the final arc of the ''Secret Warriors'' series, it was revealed that Jake's death and much of his villainy was all part of a long-game plan of Nick Fury's. In 1961, Jake Fury was duplicated by ancient technology (which would later be developed and modernized as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]] program); the evil Jake would go on to be the agent known as Scorpio. The real Jake, however, was in deep cover within [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], co-opting the identity of the high-ranking agent known as [[Kraken (character)#Daniel Whitehall|Kraken]] and infiltrating the highest rungs of the organization and helping his brother bring about its destruction.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #11-25</ref>

Scorpio was later revived in an [[android (robot)|android]] body by the intelligent, extra-dimensional Zodiac Key from which he drew his power. The real Jacques LaPoint became the second Scorpio and led the Zodiac until Jake (in his second android body) killed him. Impersonating LaPoint, Fury led eleven other Zodiac-themed androids to kill and replace the rest of the human Zodiac members, and took over the organization's criminal operations. Scorpio and the other androids were deactivated when they were transported to the Zodiac Key's dimension of origin during a battle with the [[West Coast Avengers]], and abandoned there.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #26-28</ref>

'''Mikel Fury''', Nick Fury's illegitimate son, has also used the Scorpio identity. Mikel originally believed himself to be Jake Fury's son, and used a duplicate of the Zodiac Key to battle his father and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. When he learned that his mother had lied about his parentage, Mikel switched sides and became affiliated with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] for several months, following intensive therapy.<ref>''Wolverine/Nick Fury'' Graphic Novel</ref> When he was led to believe that the [[Punisher]] had killed Nick, he pursued the vigilante until persuaded to back down by fellow [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operatives and ousted from the agency.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 3 #7</ref> He makes a brief appearance in [[Secret Warriors (2009 series)|Secret Warriors]], issue 11 as the leader from one of Nick's secret independent teams<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #11</ref> and is later killed in a mission.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #24</ref>

===Thanos' Zodiac===
The sixth Scorpio is an unnamed man with a half-burned face who [[Thanos]] recruited to join his incarnation of the Zodiac.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> He and the other Zodiac members perish when Thanos abandons them on the self-destructing Helicarrier where [[John King (comics)|Cancer]] was the only survivor.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' Vol. 2 #4</ref>

===Scorpio (Vernon Fury)===
Vernon Fury is the grandson of Jacob Fury and the grand-nephew of Nick Fury. Upon being told the stories about the Zodiac Key, Vernon planned to know what its secrets are.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #11">''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #11</ref>

When he reached adulthood, Vernon Fury assumed the alias of "Vernon Jacobs" and became a big investor and shareholder of [[Parker Industries]]. With the money he obtained, he formed the different Zodiac sects.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #10">''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #10</ref>

Thanks to a premonition by Gemini, he hacks into a satellite owned by S.H.I.E.L.D. which he uses to look into the British Museum where a rosetta stone has Zodiac Grand Orrery in it.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #5</ref>

When the planets that are shown in the Zodiac Grand Orrery get into alignment, Scorpio traveled back to his base in France. Spider-Man tracked the hacked satellite signal back to Vernon Jacobs' building. While in the Channel Tunnel, he transformed two of its staff members into becoming his next Cancer and Leo. While Spider-Man called his allies, Scorpio crashed the transmission stating that he will use his influence on Parker Industries enough to have it sink into the ground.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #10"/>

On his way to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, Scorpio transforms two other people into Pisces and Taurus. At the Royal Observatory, Scorpio places the Zodiac Grand Orrery in the prime meridian there and performed a ritual that opened a secret passageway underground. Spider-Man and his allies arrived to stop Scorpio. When Scorpio steps into the door, he sees a year filled with events like Skyspear, [[Norman Osborn]]'s latest activity, [[Regent (comics)|Regent]]'s plot, the "New U" device, [[Doctor Octopus]]' return, [[Civil War II|another superhuman civil war]], and the rise of the monsters. Catching Scorpio off guard, Spider-Man punched Scorpio into the doorway and locked it up. As Spider-Man suspects that Scorpio will have been teleported one year into the future, this would give S.H.I.E.L.D. time to prepare for Scorpio's return.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #11"/>

==Powers and abilities==
Jake Fury possessed a genius intellect, as well as basic army training, with an above average knowledge of hand-to-hand combat and streetfighting techniques. As Scorpio, Jake used the Zodiac Key to increase his physical abilities, and gain superhuman powers such as the ability to transform his body into sentient water for brief periods of time. Scorpio is totally dependent upon the Zodiac Key in order to maintain his superhuman powers. He did not have to be in physical contact with it to wield it. The Zodiac Key is a power object of extradimensional origin that taps an unidentified extradimensional energy for a variety of effects, including concussive force, electricity, magnetism, teleportation, physical transformation, etc. The Zodiac Key possesses sentience of a sort. After Jake Fury's death, the Zodiac Key employed his Theater of Genetics laboratory to create an android of Jake Fury.

Ecliptic's Zodiac had a barbed tail which was never used in combat. He also wielded a weapon similar to the Zodiac Key which displayed the ability to fire energy blasts and has a Zodiac teleportation device.
