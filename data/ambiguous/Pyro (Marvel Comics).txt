'''Pyro''' is the name of two fictional [[character (arts)|characters]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

The St. John Allerdyce version of Pyro is depicted as a recurring enemy of the [[X-Men]] and later becomes an agent of the U.S. government. He was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and introduced in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #141 ([[1981 in comics#January|January 1981]]) as part of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. Pyro had the mutant ability to control fire. Pyro and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants are the main antagonists in the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' in the X-Men comics as they attempt to assassinate [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]], which in an alternate timeline leads to a dystopic future where Mutants are hunted, killed or captured by the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] robots. Through time travel the assassination was thwarted. At a later date the Brotherhood becomes agents of the US government in exchange for a full pardon and the team becomes known as the  [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. While working for the government the team confronts both the X-Men and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. During a mission to Kuwait, Pyro is captured by the enemy. Pyro contracted the [[Legacy Virus]], fatal to all mutants, moments before his death Pyro saved Senator Kelly from another assassination attempt, changing Kelly's anti-mutant stance. Pyro was later resurrected by the [[Techno-organic virus#Transmode virus|Transmode Virus]], existing as a techno-organic being under [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s control.

Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the St. John Allerdyce version of Pyro first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #141 ([[1981 in comics#January|January 1981]]).

==Fictional character biography==
===St. John Allerdyce===
Born in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], St. John Allerdyce is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses the power to psionically control fire and flame, though not generate it. He wears a flamethrower on his back to provide the flame which he then takes control of. His ability to manipulate flame emerged in his teens, but he was unable to find a practical use for it. After years of working in Southeast [[Asia]] as a journalist and novelist, Pyro met the mutant [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who later recruited him to the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] as a professional criminal and [[subversive]]. With the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, he attempted to assassinate Senator [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]], and first battled the [[X-Men]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #141-142</ref> With the Brotherhood, he later battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #10</ref> and then the X-Men again.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #177-178</ref> Though he never served under the team's original leader, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Pyro did work with the Brotherhood under the command of several of Magneto's subordinates who alternately supervised the group.

Mystique's Brotherhood later offered the team's services to the United States government in exchange for protection and an official pardon for its crimes, and was renamed [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. As part of their first mission, the team captured Magneto.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #199</ref> With Freedom Force, he next captured the Avengers on behalf of the federal government.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #15</ref> Later, he clashed with the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] in seeking to arrest [[Rusty Collins]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #8-10</ref> With Freedom Force, he fought the X-Men in Dallas, and was present at the X-Men's [[Fall of the Mutants|apparent demise]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #223-227</ref> With Freedom Force, he battled [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]],<ref>''X-Factor'' #30-31</ref> sought to arrest Rusty Collins again, battled the [[New Mutants]], and finally arrested both Rusty and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #78-80</ref> He and [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] under [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]]'s orders attempted to capture a young mutant girl named Amanda, but were defeated by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol. 1 #269</ref> He later teamed with Blob and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] against the Avengers during the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]".<ref>''Avengers'' #312</ref>

During Freedom Force's final mission, the team confronts a group of Iraqi operatives known as [[Desert Sword]] in Kuwait. There are fatalities on both sides. [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]] is decapitated and Pyro kills the Sword operative [[Veil (comics)|Veil]]. Ultimately Freedom Force is defeated and Pyro and [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] are abandoned in Kuwait and captured.<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #11; ''New Warriors Annual'' #11; ''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #15; ''X-Factor Annual'' #6</ref> Blob and Pyro are forced to serve as bodyguards to the country's military commanders.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Later, [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] buys their release.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Blob and Pyro join the Toad's new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, and with them battled [[X-Force]].<ref>''X-Force'' #6-7</ref>

Some years later, Pyro contracted the [[Legacy Virus]], a fatal disease affecting mainly mutants.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He went to great lengths to find a cure (encountering [[Cecilia Reyes]] at one point<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #351</ref>), several times at the expense of others, but was unsuccessful in his search and succumbed to the virus.<ref name="cable87">''Cable vol. 2' #87</ref> This was just after saving [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]] from a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. This act of heroism was also instrumental in changing Senator Kelly's opinion on mutants as a whole, and led to his decision to work toward peaceful co-existence between humans and mutants.<ref name="cable87" />

Despite his heroic death, Pyro is resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#Transmode virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants.  Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref name ="XNecrosha">''X-Necrosha'' #1, December 2010</ref>

Pyro was confirmed to have remained alive after the events of Necrosha, as he battled both the original adult Iceman and the time-displaced teenage version in an attack in New York City, the older Bobby Drake confirming to his younger self that Pyro was indeed the original Australian version back from the dead.<ref name="Iceman #8">''Iceman'' Vol. 3 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Simon Lasker===
Simon Lasker is an American teenage mutant who manifested pyrokinesis by accidentally burning down his high school building and killing everyone inside it. Suddenly appearing before him in the form of Professor X, a somehow-repowered [[Mesmero (comics)|Mesmero]] brainwashed him into becoming the new Pyro and to join his Brotherhood of Mutants which was secretly funded by anti-mutant activist Lydia Nance.<ref name="X-Men Gold #21">''X-Men Gold'' Vol. 2 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Pyro's first mission with the Brotherhood of Mutants was to kidnap Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] and hold him hostage.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> The X-Men arrived and defeated the Brotherhood of Mutants who are then arrested by the arriving S.H.I.E.L.D. agents<ref>''X-Men Gold'' Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As Lydia Nance still had a use for the Brotherhood of Mutants, she orchestrated Mesmero's escape from the Box.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' Vol. 2 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mesmero once again lured Pyro and the second Avalanche into helping him out again. They were to attack a yacht that was owned by the Heritage Initiative at the time of its fundraiser. They group fought the X-Men alongside the NYPD.<ref name="X-Men Gold #21"/> The Brotherhood of Mutants got away and fell back to their base. When Mesmero stated that the Brotherhood of Mutants are still under Lydia Nance's paycheck, Pyro took his leave since he didn't want to work for an anti-mutant activist. Avalanche then demanded from Mesmero to get Pyro's cut.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' Vol. 2 #22. Marvel Comics</ref> After finding the Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach, Pyro revealed his history to the X-Men and wanted to join up with them. While Iceman was wary of this, Rogue vouched for him.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' Vol. 2 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Pyro was revealed to be gay in ''X-Men Gold'' #31, in a post-sex scene with Iceman.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Randall |first1=Devin |title=Marvel Comics Reveal Former X-Men Villain’s Gay Through Post-Sex Scene With Iceman |url=http://instinctmagazine.com/post/marvel-comics-reveal-former-x-men-villain%E2%80%99s-gay-through-post-sex-scene-iceman |website=Instinct Magazine |accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===St. John Allerdyce===
St John Allerdyce is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who has the psionic ability to manipulate flame by shaping it as he desires, increasing or decreasing its heat, intensity, and size. He cannot actually create fire himself, however, and consequently wears a specially insulated costume with a built-in [[flamethrower]] that can throw a stream of flame a maximum distance of {{convert|25|ft|m}}. He can psionically manipulate the flame to do whatever he desires, and sometimes induces it to take semi-solid form as an animate flame being (these creations, though capable of movement and of grasping or carrying solid objects, are not alive and do not think or act on their own). The degree of Pyro's concentration necessary to manipulate a flame construct is directly proportional to the construct's size, power, and flame. Though he cannot be burned by a flame which he is manipulating, Pyro can be harmed by any fire that he does not mentally control. It is generally accepted that he must be able to see a flame in order to take control of it (hence limiting his mental influence to approximately 100 yards). Any of Pyro's fiery creations will immediately revert to ordinary flame if he turns his interest from it.

===Simon Lasker===
Simon Lasker has the mutant ability to psionically generate, control, and manipulate fire, similar to the original Pyro. Unlike Allerdyce, he seems capable of igniting fire on his own, and does not require outside sources of existing flame to manipulate.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the '''[[Age of Apocalypse]]''', Pyro is one of the many mutants imprisoned in [[Mister Sinister|Sinister's]] breeding pens for refusing to join his Elite Mutant Force. He is killed alongside [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Fatale (comics)|Artemis]], [[Phantazia]], and Newt when the five prisoners attempt to escape. This version of Pyro is capable of creating flames by himself, though he is not immune to being burned.<ref>''Factor X'' #1</ref>

===House of M===
In the '''[[House of M]]''', Pyro was a member of the mutant supremacist government in Australia. He works alongside the powerful [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. He works closely with [[Vanisher]] in the oppression of the human population. They gain the attention of the [[Hulk]] when his friends, a community of Aboriginal Australians, are harassed. Here Pyro retains his background as a writer and a sentimental side; he briefly crafts a tiny pixie out of the flame from a match, commenting to the Vanisher, "I used to write Gothic romances. I've got more layers than a parfait".<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #83-85</ref>

===Marvel Adventures===
In [[Marvel Adventures Spider-Man]], the [[Human Torch]] shows up at Midtown High for a demonstration, but loses control of his powers. [[Spider-Man]] (then Peter Parker) spots a mysterious figure who turns out to be Pyro, who is manipulating Human Torch out of jealousy that he doesn't get credit for being a fire manipulator. Peter knocks him into the school swimming pool, where Human Torch knocks him out.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Marvel Zombies===
Pyro is shown as a zombie twice in the [[Marvel Zombies]] reality. He is seen in the background along with a group of zombies trying to catch [[Blob (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Blob]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs Army of Darkness'' #2</ref> He is also seen fighting the X-Men alongside zombie versions of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Ronin===
Pyro works as a murderous mutant ninja for the Japanese-based [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. He battles the X-Men alongside fellow ninja [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
In ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #80 Pyro is seen fighting the [[Friends of Humanity]] and meeting [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Ultimate Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler]].<ref name="Ultimate X-Men #80">''Ultimate X-Men'' #80</ref> This Pyro is a member of the Ultimate [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], and a supporter of [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Xavier]]'s cause who tells Nightcrawler that he would have liked to have been a member of the X-Men. In issue #82 he is rescued from a [[Sentinel (comics)#Ultimate Sentinels|Sentinel]] attack by [[Bishop (comics)#Ultimate Bishop|Bishop]] and [[Alternative versions of Storm#Ultimate Storm|Storm]], who recruit him as a member of their new team of X-Men. It is hinted by Bishop that the recruits are "legends" of the future, meaning that Pyro may have much potential. He briefly works undercover in the Mutant Liberation Front, after pretending to defect to their side.  [[Stryfe]], the leader of the group, revealed his knowledge of Pyro's intentions but allows him to continue watching, but eventually Stryfe abandons most of the Front, including Pyro, at the mercy of some approaching Sentinels. Pyro is later rescued by [[Alternative versions of Beast#Ultimate Beast|Beast]], and aids the team in defeating the Sentinels.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #87</ref>

Bishop dies in ''Ultimate X-Men'' #90 and Xavier returns alive from the future. Pyro moves into the Xavier Institute and becomes one of Xavier's X-Men. Pyro begins wondering if he belongs at the Institute and [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Ultimate Marvel|Wolverine]] assures him that he does.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

Pyro has apparently defected from the Xavier Institute to [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Ultimate Brotherhood|Brotherhood of Mutants]], as he and [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] are shown capturing the superhero [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Valkyrie|Valkyrie]] in ''[[Ultimates#The Ultimates 3|The Ultimates 3]]'' #4.  It is as yet unknown how or why Pyro joined Magneto's Brotherhood. His face is not scarred and he is now immune to flame, despite previous portrayals.<ref>''The Ultimates 3'' #4</ref>

During the confrontation, he and Mastermind find the unconscious Valkyrie. Pyro suggest they 'play' with her. The woman wakes up, slays Mastermind and despite Pyro's claims of innocence, cuts off his hands.<ref>''The Ultimates 3'' #5</ref>

Ultimate Pyro, like his Age of Apocalypse counterpart, can generate flames without the aid of machines. He also isn’t as resistant to fire, as his face is horribly burned and most of his body is bandaged. At one point, he cauterizes a bullet wound by pressing flames against it. Because he burnt off his nerves, he does not feel pain.<ref name="Ultimate X-Men #80"/>
