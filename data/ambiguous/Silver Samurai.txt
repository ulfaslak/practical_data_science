As a young man in the Japanese military, Ichirō's life was saved by Logan during the United States' [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki]]. As an old man dying of cancer, Yashida arranged to be visited by Logan before seemingly passing. Unfortunately, his successor being Mariko instead of Shingen lead to the latter trying to kill the former. In actuality, Yashida faked his death and equipped himself into his own [[adamantium]] Silver Samurai armor which wields a [[katana]] and a [[wakazashi|wakizashi]] (both of which are adamantium and can generate heat) with [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Dr. Green]] and [[Kenuichio Harada]] as enforcers. Obsessed with Wolverine's healing factor and immortality which was acknowledged by his son, Yashida devised his Silver Samurai armor not only to sustain himself but also to steal Wolverine's healing powers. Even eliminating Harada in his way, he uses his heated adamantium blades to sever Wolverine's adamantium claws which allowed him to extract Wolverine's healing factor via his Silver Samurai armor and regains his youthful form. However, Ichirō gets struck by his granddaughter with Wolverine's broken adamantium claws. As Ichirō loses control of his Silver Samurai armor, Wolverine's regrown bone claws impales Yashida through his chest before tossing him to his death in a crevasse below.
