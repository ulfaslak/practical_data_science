'''Gremlin''' (born '''Kondrati Topolov''')<ref>''Iron Man Manual Mark 3''</ref> is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Although initially an adversary of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Gremlin is killed in battle with [[Iron Man]] during the [[Armor Wars]].

==Concept and creation==
Co-creator [[Steve Englehart]] recounted, "I’ve always treated the entire run of a book, up to the point that I took it over, as worthy of respect. So I was always interested in where series started out, and how they developed in their early days. [[Gargoyle (comics)|The Gargoyle]] had indeed been in ''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'' #1, so I thought it would be fun to connect to him—but I had to make something interesting for my time, not just wave at the past. I thought, ‘Gargoyle + Kremlin = Gremlin’."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Buttery|first= Jarrod|date= February 2014|title= Hulk Smash!: The Incredible Hulk in the 1970s|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 70|page= 8|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Kondrati Topolov is the son of Russian scientist Yuri Topolov, also known as the [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Yuri Topolov)|Gargoyle]], and is himself a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]].  Kondrati inherited his father's grotesque appearance and superhuman intelligence, although he was born disfigured unlike his father, who was mutated over time from the exposure of radioactive materials. His father was cured by a captured [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] using gamma rays and died killing other Soviets in an explosion.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} A brilliant scientist like his father, he created the high-tech gear used by the Soviet Super-Troopers (the immediate precursor to the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]]), and for a time wore the [[Titanium Man]] [[power armor]]. He operated out of a secret base named Bitterfrost in Khystym, Siberia. He created a pet for himself named Droog, which was an intelligent, talking, triceratops-like monster created through genetic engineering.

As the Gremlin, he first clashed with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] at the Gremlin's secret base in the Arctic. Gremlin's men then captured General [[Thunderbolt Ross|"Thunderbolt" Ross]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #163</ref> The Hulk and General Ross later invaded the Gremlin's Bitterfrost base in Siberia to rescue the captured Major [[Glenn Talbot]]. The Gremlin and his pet Droog contended with the Hulk, but Bitterfrost was destroyed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #187-188</ref> Later, with the Soviet Super-Soldiers, [[Rom (comics)|Rom]], and [[Starshine (comics)#Brandy Clark|Starshine]], the Gremlin helped defeat the alien [[Dire Wraith]]s. The Gremlin then officially joined the Soviet Super-Soldiers.<ref>''Rom'' #44</ref>

The Gremlin next appeared as the second [[Titanium Man#Titanium Man II - The Gremlin|Titanium Man]], wearing a new suit of the [[power armor]] he had originally created for Boris Bullsky. With the other Soviet Super-Soldiers, he contended with the [[X-Men]] and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in an attempt to capture [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].<ref>''X-Men vs. the Avengers'' #1-3</ref> Later, the Gremlin fought [[Iron Man]] while wearing the Titanium Man armor during the "[[Armor Wars]]". Iron Man - despite using his weaker stealth armor - managed to defeat the [[Crimson Dynamo]] in the fight but was unable to neutralize the Gremlin, who destroyed Iron Man's negator pack. When the Gremlin grabbed Iron Man and the armored Avenger attempted to escape, his booster jets [[Titanium#Precautions|ignited the titanium armor]]. The Titanium Man armor exploded, apparently burning the Gremlin to death and forcing Iron Man to flee.<ref>''Iron Man'' #229</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Gremlin is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who has inherited the genius level intelligence that his father, the Gargoyle, gained when radiation mutated his brain. It is unclear whether or not Gremlin's intelligence is of a superhuman level.

Gremlin has completed doctoral level programs in various sciences, and has attained mastery of many areas of science and technology, notably the design of battle armor, strength-magnifying exoskeletons, and computer technology, as well as genetic engineering.

Towards the end of his career, Gremlin wore the [[Titanium Man]] armored battle suit of his design, which amplified his strength, was highly resistant to damage, enabled him to fly, and from which he could project destructive energy bolts.

==Other characters named Gremlin==
* There was a Gremlin who appeared in ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'' #61. He is an agent of [[Doctor Hydro]] and one of his Hydro-Men where he hijacked an airplane that [[Namorita]] and Betty Dean Prentiss were on. Gremlin used a disc which could hypnotize others.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #61</ref>
