Max Mullins has the ability to rewire and alter a person's brainwaves to his liking. Taking on the name Synapse he, along with La Concierge and [[Stilt-Man]], were recruited by the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] to form the third incarnation of the [[Emissaries of Evil]]. One of the first things he did was shut down Stilt-Man's brain, albeit temporarily, so that he would not reveal his employer's name to [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], who at the time was acting as an agent for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and had his mind wiped to think he was Laurent Levasseur.<ref>''Daredevil'' #377</ref> While La Concierge was battling Laurent, Synapse was holding Dr. Claudia DuBois hostage along with [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]]. Tired of being pushed around, Synapse planned on using his powers on Fisk, but Fisk, who had a stronger mind, knew of Synapses plot and threatened to kill him if he did not continue to work under him.<ref>''Daredevil'' #378</ref> Eventually, Fisk has Synapse use his powers on Laurent, but it instead reminds him that he is Daredevil and knocks out Synapse with one kick.<ref>''Daredevil'' #379</ref>
