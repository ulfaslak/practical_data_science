The '''Sandman''' is an alien monster made of sand that first appeared in ''Journey into Mystery'' #70 and was created by Jack Kirby. This monster is not to be confused with the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|supervillain of the same name]].

The alien Sandman crash-landed on Earth where he ended up in Mexico. The local tribespeople thought it was an evil spirit. They took him while he was still weak from his crash and sealed him in a cave with no air and light where he remained in a state of suspended animation. By the early 1960s, a vacationing Marine named Steve Bronson and his family accidentally unleashed the alien Sandman on the world. The alien Sandman regained its consciousness and recounted its past to the Bronson family and planned to conquer the Earth. Steve Bronson tried to oppose the alien Sandman, but it proved invulnerable to physical assault. The alien Sandman ordered the Bronsons to transport him to North America, so he could observe the most powerful nation on the planet before putting his plan into action. Steve Bronson was able to alert the military to the alien Sandman's presence, but they also proved ineffective in dealing with the extraterrestrial threat. Bullets went right through him, gas was ineffectual because he does not breathe and while bombs would scatter his pieces, he proved capable of reforming himself afterwards. The alien Sandman planned to increase its size by absorbing every sand on the beaches until nothing can stop him. Steve Bronson's son Bobby heard about the plan and headed to the beach with a plan of his own. Bobby threw a pile of water over the sand which made the alien Sandman soggy to the point where he couldn't move. The military quickly transported the alien Sandman's body to a top-secret underground facility where he has remained ever since.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #70. Marvel Comics.</ref>

'''Xemnu the Living Titan''', also known as '''Xemnu the Hulk''', is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Xemnu is an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] who has attempted to conquer the Earth several times. The character first appeared in the story "I Was a Slave of the Living Hulk!" in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #62, and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

Xemnu first appeared when his starship crash-landed on Earth after running out of fuel.<ref name="first">''Journey into Mystery'' (November 1960). Marvel Comics. Reprinted: ''Marvel Monsters: Devil Dinosaur'' (2005) #1 [http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/oddball/index.cgi?date=2002-02-18 Summary]</ref> When revived by the human Joe Harper, Xemnu reveals that he was a criminal who had been exiled into space for crimes against the rest of the universe, and had escaped a prison planet and fled to Earth.<ref name="first" /> Xemnu then used [[telepathy]] to dominate Harper's mind and then the minds of every other human on Earth.<ref name="first" /> He forced them to build him a new starship so that he could return home.<ref name="first" /> As he departs, he releases Harper from his telepathic domination. Harper sabotages the ship's electrical systems, shocking Xemnu into a coma-like state. As the alien flew off, his mind control faded, and his former servants forgot that he had ever existed. Xemnu used [[telekinesis]] to direct an asteroid to strike his ship so that it would be knocked onto a course back to Earth. After crashing down on Earth a second time, the weakened Xemnu was taken into a circus sideshow. As he took control of the town where the circus was located, Joe Harper followed Xemnu's trail and confronts the alien. Xemnu attempts to disintegrate Harper, but Harper used a mirror to reflect the alien's psychic power back at it, and Xemnu's body was destroyed.<ref name="first" />

Xemnu then traveled through space in a non-corporeal form, and over the years learned that his home planet had been wiped out by a plague. He returned to Earth, possessing the body of an astronaut named Richmond Wagner to gain a physical form. When the space shuttle arrived on Earth, Xemnu used his human host's popularity and his own telepathy to become the host of a children's television series. He used his mental power to place Earth's children under his thrall, planning to abduct them to repopulate his home world, only to be detected by [[Doctor Strange]]. Strange and his ally [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] were defeated by the alien, but Xemnu was in turn beaten by the [[Hulk]].<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Xemnu then took possession of Amos Moses, mayor of small-town Plucketville in an attempt to kidnap the townspeople of Plucketville to repopulate his home planet. The newly formed [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] (Doctor Strange, the Hulk, the Sub-Mariner and the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]]) fought him, thus preventing him from using the townspeople to construct another starship.<ref>''Defenders'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> Xemnu continued his vendetta against the Hulk via a series of clones created from samples of other "classic Marvel" alien monsters,<ref>[http://www.marvelrpg.net/mp/dm198mp.pdf The Marvel Phile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060115090403/http://www.marvelrpg.net/mp/dm198mp.pdf |date=2006-01-15 }}, James Lowder, ''Dragon Magazine'', p. 34.</ref> sent to attack the Hulk, and battled the Hulk himself; however, he was defeated when the dam containing his hideout burst.<ref>''Hulk Annual'' #5</ref> Xemnu later used Amos Moses' body in an attempt to once again take control of the Earth via television-transmitted hypnosis. Xemnu took mental control of the Los Angeles-based hero [[Wonder Man]] using him to attack his ally, the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. The heroes eventually defeated Xemnu, and he fled in a starship.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #78. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, deep in space, Xemnu infiltrates the spacecraft-haulage craft owned by [[Ulysses Solomon Archer]]. He takes over the enclosed area of the ''Star Stop Diner'' and confronts a pregnant woman known as Mary McGrill. He plans to genetically alter her child to make it one of his own race. He is opposed by [[Razorback (comics)|Razorback]], Archer, [[She-Hulk]] and everyone else at the diner, but they are easily knocked out by his psychic powers.<ref>"Star Truck", ''Sensational She Hulk'' #6 (October 1989), Marvel Comics</ref> She-Hulk awakens ahead of the others and finds that Xemnu is attempting to turn her into a "She-Xemnu." Ultimately, Xemnu is defeated and given over to a powerful humanoid alien named Big Enilwen. This childlike being believes that Xemnu is simply a teddy bear to play with.<ref>"I Have No Mouth and I am Mean", ''Sensational She Hulk'' #7 (November 1989), Marvel Comics</ref>

Xemnu convinces Enilwen to free his teddy bear population to 'the wild'. He returns to confront She-Hulk again, this time to sell her into slavery. This time he is defeated by a large monkey wrench to the head, wielded by She-Hulk's friend [[Blonde Phantom|Louise Mason]].{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

Xemnu reappeared as one of [[Space Phantom]]'s kidnapped bodies in ''[[Beyond!]]''.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} He appeared in ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' as one of the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] select.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Xemnu later returned to Earth and fought [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] after [[Woodgod]]'s defeat. During that time, [[Impossible Man]] uses his magic to combine Hulk and Red Hulk into the Compound Hulk which fights Xemnu's minion Kluh (a smart version of the Gray Hulk) and overpowers it.<ref name="Hulk Vol. 2 #30">''Hulk'' Vol. 2 #30. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name="Hulk Vol. 2 #30"/>

Xemnu later appeared on [[Monster Isle]] when [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]] appeared to look for a mutant girl named Bo. Xemnu was among the monsters that attacked the three until Magik teleported herself, Shadowcat, and Bo to the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Xemnu later appears alongside [[Rocket Raccoon]].<ref>''Rocket Raccoon'' Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Monsters Unleashed (comics)|Monsters Unleashed]]" storyline, Xemnu is among the monsters seen falling from the sky near San Diego.<ref>''Monsters Unleashed'' Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Thanks to his alien genetic structure, Xemnu possesses great superhuman strength, almost comparable to the [[She-Hulk]]'s even at his present smaller size. Xemnu also possesses superhuman stamina and durability, and he has a gifted intellect with advanced knowledge of genetics. His main resource lies in his enormous, extraordinary psionic abilities, including telepathy, hypnosis, possession, and levitation. These abilities enable him to effortlessly control millions or even billions of minds at a time, immediately induce unconsciousness in crowds of people, or even put mental blocks in the mind of [[Doctor Strange]], the "[[Sorcerer Supreme]]" of the [[Marvel Universe]], although the [[Hulk]] has proved immune to Xemnu's psionic possession. He can also project psionic concussive blasts of tremendous power, sufficient to stagger even the Hulk, animate unliving objects, including asteroids, and he can create personal "atmo-spheres", a protective sphere of psionic energy, which he can use to fly with himself in it. If destroyed, he can inhabit another living being and transform it into a smaller (11&nbsp;ft) copy of his original body. He is highly adept in his native technology, and has been capable of engineering genetic monstrosities capable of challenging even Hulk's might, or using a machine that turns humans into members of his species, including transforming She-Hulk into a "She-Xemnu".

====Xemnu in other media====
Xemnu appears in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode, "The Strongest One There Is", voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].<ref name="The Strongest One There Is">{{cite episode|title=The Strongest One There Is|series=Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=9|airdate=February 1, 2015}}</ref> This variation is much taller and stronger than the Hulk. He is interested in challenging local fighters and delivers a challenge, via hologram, to fight the Hulks - all except Rick. Seeing it as pointless, Hulk moves to reject but Rick accepts on behalf of the entire team. His colleagues lose. Feeling guilty, Rick tries one more time and manages to defeat Xemnu. Xemnu declares his journey for a skilled fight over and bonds with Rick over video games and doughnuts.

Six years after the release of the original comic, the fictitious alien Xemnu (under the barely altered name [[Xenu]] or Xemu) would become a central part of the secret teachings of the new religion of [[Scientology]].<ref>Susan, Raine (2017).
