'''Puma''' ('''Thomas Fireheart''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted as a villain initially, although he gained a great respect for [[Spider-Man]] and became his occasional ally.

==Publication history==
Puma first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #256 and was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]]. The inspiration for the character comes from safari cards bought by Tom DeFalco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/05/13/comic-book-legends-revealed-313/|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #313|editor=[[Comic Book Resources]]|author=Brian Cronin|date=May 13, 2011|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref>

In the Puma's earliest appearances, he acted as a mercenary, and an antagonist to [[Spider-Man]], but soon came to respect him.  Puma was then depicted as an ally of Spider-Man, assisting him from time to time in his appearances in ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' series.  He was associated with the superhero team known as the Outlaws for a time, and was later one of the main characters in the ''MODOK's 11'' limited series.

==Fictional character biography==
Puma's real name is '''Thomas Fireheart''', and he is of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] descent. The tribe he belongs to (located near Hartsdale, [[New Mexico]]; ''Marvel Westerns: Western Legends'' suggests that the tribe may be the Kisani, as one of Puma's ancestors belonged to that tribe and lived at Lost Mesa) has had an ancient prophecy of the coming of a powerful being who might destroy the world for generations. Long ago, they began making preparations for this coming doom. They used mystic ceremonies and selective breeding to create a perfect warrior. Thomas Fireheart is the latest in this line of men. Though he never believed in the prophecy, he took his duties as protector of his tribe seriously, and has strived his whole life to be the best he could be, mastering his ability to turn into a powerful humanoid [[Cougar|mountain lion]] [[werecat]]. He also trained in Martial Arts in Japan under a man named Master Muramoto.

Very intelligent, and with a good business sense, he became owner and [[CEO]] of Fireheart Enterprises. Headquartered near his tribe in Hartsdale, [[Arizona]], it is a multinational corporation involved in many different endeavors, with regional offices around the world. Becoming bored with corporate life, he began to seek greater challenges, and offered his skills as Puma for sale.

He was operating as a mercenary and had been hired by the [[Richard Fisk|Rose]] to kill Spider-Man, but was thwarted by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #256</ref> He again attempted to attack Spider-Man, but changed his mind and departed when he witnessed Spider-Man saving innocent bystanders.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #257</ref>

Puma later confronted the [[Beyonder]] in New York; however, the Beyonder simply transported him to downtown Tokyo.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #273</ref> Puma became enraged at the death of Master Muramoto as the inadvertent result of the Beyonder's actions. Puma reached a state of "harmonious enlightenment with the universe" and was imbued with immeasurable power. However, doubting his own senses, Puma lost the mystical power just as he attacked the Beyonder.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #111</ref> Puma was able to learn Spider-Man's secret identity, Peter Parker, thanks to his enhanced senses, and now felt he owed him a debt of honor as a result of the Beyonder affair. He offered Peter Parker a job at his company while Peter was on his honeymoon in France; however, Peter declined the offer.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]] Annual'' #7</ref> Puma later attempted to clear Spider-Man's name of a crime he didn't commit, and first encountered [[Silver Sable]] and [[The Outlaws (comics)|The Outlaws]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #50</ref>

When the mutant powers of Charles Little Sky, a kinsman of Fireheart's (and the man later known as [[Portal (comics)|Portal]]), first manifested, Fireheart tried to help his fellow tribesman better understand his powers.  Rejecting Fireheart's offers of aid, Portal fled to [[Ellis Island]] where Fireheart caught up to him.  When Portal's powers activated again and returned the [[U-Foes]] to Earth, Fireheart was forced to team up with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as Puma to protect Little Sky, helping to defeat the villains.<ref>''Avengers'' #304 (June 1989)</ref>

Puma then battled Spider-Man in New York.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #154</ref> Fireheart actually purchased 51% of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', made [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson|Robbie Robertson]] publisher, and began a pro-Spider-Man campaign in the publication, in an attempt to pay off his debt of honor.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #156</ref> During this time, he was nearly killed in an attack by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], but was saved by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #161</ref>

Fireheart agreed to join Spider-Man's rag-tag superhero group called the Outlaws, along with several other Spider-Man adversaries-turn-allies (including [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Rocket Racer]], and the [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]]). The group clashed with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], until it was revealed that both groups were actually being manipulated by the shape-changing [[Space Phantom]], whom Thomas exposed and defeated.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #169-170</ref>

He eventually sold the ''Daily Bugle'' back to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] for $1, and he and Spider-Man settled their debt of honor on a [[vision quest]] in [[New Mexico]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #171-172</ref>

Fireheart's Puma persona later consumed him, and he attempted to assassinate a US Senator. Spider-Man stopped him, but not before the [[NYPD]] shot Fireheart several times. The [[Black Crow (comics)|Black Crow]] cast a magical spell removing all knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity from Fireheart's mind.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #191-193</ref>  He was nursed back to mental and physical health by another character named Nocturne (not the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] character [[Nocturne (Talia Wagner)|Nocturne]]).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #395-396</ref><ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #218</ref>

Puma was seen in the Bloodsport competition.<ref>''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' vol. 2 #167-168</ref> He made it to the semi-final round, but was defeated by Wolverine.

He was next seen teaming up with Spider-Man and the Black Cat to stop [[Stegron]] from "de-evolving" the population of New York.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' #23-27</ref> After this Puma began a relationship with the Black Cat (as shown they were both in bed) although he notices Felicia may still have feelings for Peter Parker.<ref name="Sensational Spider-Man #34">''Sensational Spider-Man'' #34</ref>

After the events of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', he was seen helping Spider-Man escort Prowler out of the [[Bar With No Name]].<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #4</ref> He has also been seen helping Black Cat from the sidelines. She has decided to help Peter Parker, who is on the run after the events of the ''Civil War''. Together, Puma and Black Cat neutralize the drunken rampage of the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], mostly through sheer bluffing.<ref name="Sensational Spider-Man #34"/> Puma also attended training at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]].<ref name="battledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & Ronald Byrd | Penciller =  | Inker =  | Story =  | Title = [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War Battle Damage Report]] | Issue = one-shot |date= March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Fireheart was then accused of federal bribery (which so far appears to be a [[Frameup|frame job]]) and his assets frozen; forbidden by his tribe from taking any contract kills, he has joined [[MODOK]]'s 11 to get the cash he needs to defend himself in court. However, this meant disobeying the tribal council's order to remain on the reservation and so he's had his puma powers stripped from him, leaving him a regular human right in the middle of the mission. When deciding to rescue the [[Living Laser]], who had earlier saved his life, he had an epiphany that defending one's own people is what the Puma Totem is meant to do, and he regained his powers in the process. Or so he thinks — actually [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Deadly Nightshade]] had secretly injected him with "werewolf serum". Puma has gained his cash from MODOK and has taken up an offer from Nightshade to help his legal defense; any long-term effects from the serum are unknown.<ref>''Supervillain Team-Up'' #1-5 (2007-2008)</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Puma is seen as a member of the Underground when Hydra took over the United States.<ref>''Occupy Avengers'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Puma possesses a number of superhuman attributes that are a result of a combination of genetic engineering and mysticism. Thomas Fireheart is the latest in a line of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] that were specially matched and bred to produce a perfect human being. That genetic manipulation was enhanced by an unknown supernatural process through which his tribe endowed him with magical abilities.

Fireheart undergoes a physical transformation through intense concentration that includes an increase in his height and weight, his body becoming covered with a fine tan fur, and razor sharp fangs and claws.

Transformation into this form also grants Fireheart superhuman physical attributes of catlike strength, speed, intelligence, agility, durability, flexibility, reflexes/reactions, coordination, balance and endurance, like his namesake.

Puma also possesses superhumanly acute senses. His sense of touch is enhanced to the extent that he is able to feel the impressions of ink on a piece of paper. His vision and hearing are enhanced in a similar manner, enabling him to both see and hear sights and sounds that ordinary humans can't and to see and hear at much greater distances. Puma also possesses a superhumanly acute sense of smell that he uses to track a target by scent.

He is also an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant, having received training in numerous martial arts disciplines, especially in the martial arts used by Master Muramoto. As head of Fireheart Enterprises, Puma has access to highly advanced technology as well as a personal staff of trained investigators that often provide him information on enemies and potential enemies. In his identity as Thomas Fireheart, Puma is a very wealthy, skilled and respected businessman, with a master's degree in Business Administration. He has a personal customized Lear jet for long-distance travel.

While some of Puma's activities are morally dubious, he is not truly evil and is not a criminal. His primary concerns are his own personal advancement and the welfare of his people, and he has come to Spider-Man's aid as often as he has tried to harm him.

==Other versions==

===Earth-001===
On Earth-001 during the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline, Fireheart (a character that resembles Puma) is a member of the [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]] who are servants of Verna of the Inheritors. He accompanies Verna and the other Hounds when they head to [[Ultimate Marvel|Earth-1610]] to hunt [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #9</ref> He is killed by the [[Superior Spider-Man]], and his allies Spider-Punk and Assassin Spider-Man.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Slott|penciller = Olivier Coipel|inker = Wade von Grawbadger|story = Spider-Verse Part Two: Superior Force|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 3|issue = #10|date = 19 November 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
Puma appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "Take Two."<ref>{{cite episode|title=Take Two|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=27|airdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> This version is a member of the [[Wild Pack]] and wears a special gauntlet on his left hand that extends its claws. He accompanies the Wild Pack into stealing the Neuro Cortex from Horizon High for the anonymous client. This led to the Wild Pack fighting Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man defeated Puma using his web attack. Afterwards, Puma and the Wild Pack are thrown in prison.

===Video games===
Puma appeared in the [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] versions of the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' game, and voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} He lured [[Spider-Man]] into a trap at his warehouse by having [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s car stolen. Spider-Man fought through Puma's cronies until he confronted him in a small room where the two briefly fought. Puma then took the fight outside on the rooftops by busting through the glass window of the room, and after fighting on three roofs, Spider-Man chased Puma at a water fountain. Their fight brought them to a construction site where Spider-Man chased down Puma throughout the site until they ended up in a cage, where Puma reluctantly surrendered in the fight after much beating. But he gleefully tells Spider-Man that he was merely a distraction so that [[Doctor Octopus]] would kidnap Mary Jane. Puma tries to get away again, but Spider-Man webs him up against a girder and finally defeats the villain.
