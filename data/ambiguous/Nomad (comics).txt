'''Nomad''' is the name of several fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Nomad name and costume were created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]] as an alternate identity for the original Captain America, '''[[Steve Rogers (comics)|Steve Rogers]]''', in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #180 (December 1974).

The identity was revived by writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] for a minor character named '''Edward Ferbel''' in ''Captain America'' #261-263 (September - November 1981). The same writer later gave the title to its best known claimant '''[[Jack Monroe (comics)|Jack Monroe]]''' in ''Captain America'' #281 (May 1983). Other claimants of the code name are '''[[Rikki Barnes]]''' and Steve Rogers's adopted son '''Ian Rogers'''.

The original Nomad is an alternate identity that Steve Rogers adopts after he abandons the Captain America costume and title.

In ''Captain America'' #180 (December 1974) Rogers becomes disillusioned with the [[United States government]], when he discovers that a high ranking government official (heavily hinted to be the then [[President of the United States]] [[Richard Nixon]]) is the leader of the terrorist organization known as the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]].

Rogers then decides to abandon his Captain America identity, feeling that he cannot continue to serve America after this latest discovery has shattered his faith in the nation's status. However, a confrontation with [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] (disguised as the [[Golden Archer]]) forces Rogers to realize that he cannot abandon a life of heroism, and he subsequently takes on the name "Nomad" (as it means "man without a country") adopting a new dark blue and yellow uniform with no patriotic markings on it at all.

This identity is short-lived, with Rogers maintaining it for a mere four issues of the comic to varying degrees of success; he even trips over his own cape at one point. At the conclusion of ''Captain America'' #184 (April 1975) Rogers returns to the role of Captain America when he realizes that he could champion America's ideals without blindly supporting its government.

==Edward Ferbel==
Introduced in ''Captain America'' #261 (September 1981), the second Nomad was Edward Ferbel, a short-lived character who is given the Nomad costume and equipment by the [[Red Skull]] in an effort to discredit Captain America.

He is killed by an agent of the Skull, the [[Ameridroid]], in ''Captain America'' #263 (November 1981).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/master/njnor.htm |title=njnor |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date=1941-12-07 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref>

==Jack Monroe==

The third and best known Nomad is Jack Monroe, who was formerly known as the third [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]]. He was created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Sal Buscema in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #153 (September 1972).

==Rikki Barnes==
