Dennis Golembuski was the grandson of a Polish freedom fighter who immigrated to America. Dennis may or may not have killed a man at the age of eight. He spent some time working as an underboss for [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], but quit. He began to work for a mysterious new master.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

Later he had [[Mosh (comics)|Mosh]] brought to him for robbing a liquor store under his "protection". Mosh refused to hand over a percentage of his take from the robbery. So Golem and his assistant Madame Rapier kill Mosh. He recruited the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] to help protect a batch of "bloodstones". After the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] arrived and stole half the diamonds, he gave Madam Rapier a list of pawn shops for them to scout, in case Hood tried to sell them. Hood arrived at the Golem's office and asking for a cut of the diamonds if he returned the rest undamaged. Golem agreed but after the Hood left, told Rapier to kill the thief at their rendezvous.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

After the Hood double-crossed Rapier, knowing she planned to double-cross him, she was killed  in a hail of police gunfire.

After they reported back to him, he promised that nothing was ended between him and the Hood.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

Dennis apparently possesses no powers beyond those of a normal man his age.
