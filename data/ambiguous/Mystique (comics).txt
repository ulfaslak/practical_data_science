Mystique is a member of a subspecies of humanity known as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], who are born with superhuman abilities. Mystique is a [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] who can mimic the appearance and voice of any person with exquisite precision, and her natural appearance includes blue skin and yellow eyes. She is typically portrayed as a foe of the X-Men.

Throughout most of her history, Mystique has been a [[supervillain]], founding her own [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and [[assassinating]] several important people involved in mutant affairs. She has commented that she is over 100 years old.<ref name="over100">Stated in [http://www.comicvine.com/mystique/49-11391/ her solo series] (#17), "I wasn't born last night, or even last century, for that matter..."</ref> Mystique is the mother of the villain [[Graydon Creed]], the ''X-Men'' hero [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]],<ref name=nightcrawlermother>Brian Cronin.

==Publication history==
Mystique was created by artist [[David Cockrum]]. [[Chris Claremont]] saw Cockrum's design, dubbed the character "Mystique", and, with Cockrum's permission, set her in ''[[Ms. Marvel (comics)|Ms. Marvel]]'' #16 (May 1978).<ref>[http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=7711 CHRIS CLAREMONT, UNTIL THE BITTER END] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103152810/http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=7711 |date=January 3, 2010 }} Protein Wisdom.

Claremont, a former ''X-Men'' writer, has said that he originally intended Mystique and [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] to be [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'s biological parents (with Mystique having morphed into a male body for the act of conception),<ref name="Ingro">Ingro, Cheryl.

===Sabretooth===
{{Anchor|Graydon Creed|Sabertooth}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sabretooth2.jpg|thumb|Cover to ''Sabretooth'' #2. Art by Mark Texeira.]] -->

While in her Raven persona, Mystique adopts the identity of deceased German secret agent Leni Zauber. Both Leni and Victor Creed, a.k.a. [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], had been assigned with the assassination of a scientist in [[East Berlin]]. Mystique completes the mission in place of Leni, and then she and Victor have to hide in a safe location for a while. They become lovers, but she soon fakes her death in order to leave him.<ref>''Sabretooth'' #3</ref>

The result of this short-lived affair is reportedly the birth of [[Graydon Creed]]. A number of stories report that soon after his birth, Mystique gives him up for adoption. Others depict Mystique making arrangements for him from a distance. Raven keeps track of his activities until he reaches adolescence. Despite being the child of two mutants, Graydon is not a mutant himself. Mystique is disappointed and soon abandons him. Graydon grows to hate his parents, and eventually extends his hatred to all mutants. He becomes leader of the mutant-hating organization [[Friends of Humanity]], and then a politician. At the height of his political ascension, Graydon is assassinated by an unknown shooter.<ref>''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #130</ref> The shooter is later revealed to be a time traveling version of Mystique as part of a convoluted time paradox involving [[Jean Grey]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>''X-Men Forever'' (2001 series) #2</ref>

===Nightcrawler===
Still masquerading as Raven, Mystique is married to [[Baron]] Christian Wagner; older sources give his name as [[Count]] Eric Wagner, an affluent member of the German [[nobility]]. He proves to be a loving husband, but disappointing as a lover. His [[infertility]] adds to their marital problems. Mystique starts using her shapeshifting powers in order to secretly have sexual encounters with others. She is eventually seduced by fellow mutant [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]]. Azazel states that he is ruler of "an island nation off the coast of [[Bermuda]]: La Isla des Demonas", The Island of [[Demon]]s.{{issue|date=December 2014}} He is later revealed to also have the power of [[immortality]] and to be the father of an ancient race of mutants known as the [[Neyaphem]], active since at least 2000 BC.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

Mystique becomes pregnant, but her husband becomes suspicious and his own father suggests a blood test to verify whether the child is his. Mystique uses a dagger to murder him and then buries him. She gives birth to a baby with black hair, yellow eyes, blue skin, and a pointed tail. The locals consider the mother and child to be demons and attempt to kill them. Mystique escapes but abandons her son. He is found and raised by [[Romani people|Gypsy]] sorceress [[Margali Szardos]] and named [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]].{{issue|date=December 2014}}

===Rogue===
Mystique becomes the adoptive mother of the four-year-old girl [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. Rogue had run away from her home in rural Caldecott County, [[Mississippi]]. The girl was living alone in a wooded area, brandishing a shotgun and trusting no one, when Mystique found her. Destiny foresees that Rogue will be important to them and Mystique seeks her out, gains her trust, and takes her in. She and Destiny raise the girl, and Mystique grows to be very protective of her.

Mystique, as Raven Darkhölme, rises rapidly through the United States Civil Service to the trusted position of Deputy Director of the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) in the [[United States Department of Defense]]. This position gives her access to military secrets and advanced weaponry, both of which she uses for her own criminal and subversive purposes. In this position, she attempts the theft of the Centurion weaponry from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #17</ref> She also beat [[Ms. Marvel]]'s lover [[Michael Barnett (comics)|Michael Barnett]] to death, and sought to kill Ms. Marvel.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes'' Vol. 2 #11</ref>

To help her in her criminal activities, Mystique organizes her own incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], consisting of herself, [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], Destiny, and [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]]. The Brotherhood attempts to assassinate Senator [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]], a notoriously anti-mutant politician. The X-Men thwart the assassination attempt, and all of the Brotherhood save Mystique herself are incarcerated.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #141–142 (January–February 1981)</ref>

Rogue is trained by Mystique and eventually joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Her mutant power is the ability to absorb the memories, personality, and skills or powers of whomever she touches. To free the other members of the Brotherhood, Mystique concocts a plan involving Rogue absorbing the powers of Ms. Marvel and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Though the plan is successful, the Avengers ultimately defeat the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, capturing all of them except Rogue and Mystique. Moreover, Rogue finds that she has absorbed Ms. Marvel's memories, personality, and powers permanently.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #10 (1981)</ref> In a further humiliation, a confrontation at the Pentagon ends with Mystique being defeated and turned over to the authorities by a powerless Ms. Marvel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #158 (June 1982)</ref>

The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants eventually escape, and battle against [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]].<ref>''Dazzler'' #22–23 (December 1982-January 1983)</ref> In an act of revenge against Mystique, [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] unbalances Rogue's psyche with the one she absorbed from Ms. Marvel, which prompts her to defect to the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #170–171 (June–July 1983)</ref> Because Rogue left without a word, Mystique assumes that [[Professor X]], the X-Men's mentor, brainwashed her. The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants accordingly launches an attempt to kill Professor X. Rogue stops Mystique, and explains that she joined the X-Men because Professor X, as the world's most powerful [[telepath]], is her best hope of healing for her fragmented psyche. Mystique reluctantly relinquishes her guardianship of Rogue.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #177–178 (January–February 1984)</ref>

===Freedom Force===
Anti-mutant sentiment rises and the federal government launches its own covert anti-mutant program, [[Project Wideawake]]. Believing that the times have become too dangerous for the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to continue, Mystique goes to Doctor [[Valerie Cooper]], special assistant to the head of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and offers the Brotherhood's services to the government. In return for entering government service, Mystique and her team receive a presidential [[pardon]] for all criminal charges, to be revoked if any member of Freedom Force is found committing a crime. Cooper agrees to convey the offer to the President on the condition that the Brotherhood arrests their founder, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. The Brotherhood, now reincarnated as [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], are defeated by Magneto and the X-Men. When Magneto learns that Freedom Force are official federal agents, he voluntarily surrenders to them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #199</ref>

Mystique leads Freedom Force in capturing the Avengers on behalf of the federal government.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #15; ''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #1</ref> She clashes with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] in seeking to arrest [[Rusty Collins]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #8–10</ref> With Freedom Force, she fights the X-Men in Dallas, and witnesses [[Fall of the Mutants|her foster daughter's apparent demise]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #223–227</ref> With Freedom Force, she battles [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #40</ref> With Freedom Force she seeks to arrest Rusty Collins again, and battles the [[New Mutants]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #78</ref> She finally succeeds in capturing Collins as well as [[Skids (comics)|Skids]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #80, 82</ref> She leads Freedom Force against the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] on [[Muir Island]]. On this particularly disastrous mission, Freedom Force loses two of its members, [[Stonewall (comics)|Stonewall]] and Mystique's lover Destiny.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #254–255</ref> The death of her lover leaves Mystique psychologically scarred.

Mystique is later nearly killed by Dr. Valerie Cooper, who is under the [[Shadow King]]'s mental control.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #266</ref> She then impersonates Dr. Valerie Cooper.<ref>''X-Factor'' #60</ref> Mystique is eventually discovered impersonating Dr. Cooper, and saves Xavier's life by killing the Shadow King's human host, Jacob Reisz.<ref>''X-Factor'' #69</ref> She finally reconciles with Rogue.<ref>''X-Factor'' #70</ref> In time, she comes to terms with Destiny's death.<ref>''X-Factor Annual'' #6</ref> She teams with [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in thwarting [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]'s near-destruction of the universe.<ref>''Wolverine'' #51–53</ref> Mystique later briefly stays as a guest at [[X-Mansion|Xavier's mansion]]. She begins going insane, and leaves the mansion under the care of Forge.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #289–290</ref>

===X-Factor===
Mystique resurfaces several months later, in a failed attempt to kill [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] for his murdering of Destiny.<ref>''X-Factor'' 108</ref> Mystique has an implant put in her skull by [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] in order for the government to be able to keep track of her. She is then forced to become a member of the government-sponsored team [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] after being arrested for trying to blow up a dam.<ref>''X-Men Prime'', July, 1995</ref> In truth, Mystique had been trying to save the dam, which the U.S. Government wanted to destroy so that they could blame it on mutants. Her membership leads to tension with her teammates when Sabretooth is added to the team months later as a [[sleeper agent]]<ref>''X-Factor'' #121</ref>, for the main purpose of killing Mystique before she can uncover the truth about the conspiracy. She slowly develops a romantic relationship with team-leader Forge (though he later thought that she was just using him).<ref>''X-Factor'' #136</ref>

Part of the conspiracy involves Mystique's son Graydon Creed running for President, under an anti-mutant platform.<ref>''X-Factor'' #130</ref>

At the same time, both Graydon and Mystique learn that Destiny married and had children during one of the couple's separations. Destiny/Irene's children are now adults with their own children, one of which is a mutant. Graydon has the mutant teen savagely beaten by members of the Friends of Humanity, as a warning towards his mother. Mystique is furious and wants to kill her son, but stops when she is given a message that Graydon's backers want her to kill him and turn her son into a martyr.<ref>''X-Factor'' #127</ref>

Mystique then seeks to save her son from being betrayed by his backers, but fails. Graydon's death ushers in a new wave of anti-mutant violence. Sabretooth acts on his orders to kill the members of X-Factor as "Operation Zero Tolerance" is activated. Mystique distracts Sabretooth long enough to keep him from finishing off the team.<ref>''X-Factor'' #136</ref> Mystique then flees the scene after arranging for X-Factor to receive medical treatment for the wounds Sabretooth inflicted.

Mystique goes into hiding, taking the identity of the senator's wife Mallory Brickman, using her husband's influence to set the FBI on Sabretooth. She prevents Rogue from giving up her mutant powers and continues her investigation of the U.S. Government over her son's death, leading to her aiding Toad and his most recent incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Toad's Brotherhood|Brotherhood of Mutants]] on a mission to raid a government base. The mission fails thanks to [[Machine Man]], who fights the Brotherhood and forces the team to flee. Mystique flees to Europe. While taking the form of a blonde haired woman, Mystique is confronted by a famous photographer who proposes to make her a big fashion model.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Amused, Mystique accepts and quickly becomes the fashion industry's newest top model. Using her money, Mystique moves back to New York and into an expensive penthouse apartment. There, [[Skrull]]s staying in a nearby building frame Mystique for the murder of a Japanese diplomat. With help from Shadowcat and Rogue, Mystique is cleared and leaves town. Before she leaves, Shadowcat finds one of [[Destiny (Irene Adler)#The Books of Truth|Destiny's diaries]], left there by Destiny herself before she died.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===Breakdown===
While gaining critical intelligence on the identity of those who were involved in her son's death and the attempt to kill her using Sabretooth, Mystique suddenly loses her powers while pretending to be a man in a busy office workplace.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

Mystique is arrested. The U.S. Government acts on their intelligence regarding Mystique, and destroys all of the alternate identities that she established over the years and confiscate the money she and Destiny had hidden away. The loss of her powers and her freedom causes her to lash out at everyone around her. Rogue has no sympathy for Mystique's plight. The relationship sours when Rogue refuses to tell Mystique that the X-Men are going to fight the [[High Evolutionary]], who was responsible for depowering all mutants, in order to restore everyone's powers. The X-Men defeat the High Evolutionary and restore everyone's powers, allowing Mystique to escape jail.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

Mystique is sent back in time by the original [[Ship (comics)|X-Factor's sentient ship]]. Raven finds that she is destined to be part of a great time paradox, where she finds herself with a time delay weapon, which she is about to program to kill Graydon. After some deliberation, she decides to activate the weapon to kill Graydon. Mystique's sanity is further damaged by the revelation that Destiny was one of the founding members of the anti-mutant conspiracy Mystique had dedicated countless years to fighting, and had willfully withheld medical treatment to mutant children that would have resulted in them not growing up deformed due to their mutations.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

This leads to Raven again going mad. She reforms the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants for another assassination attempt on Senator Kelly, and kidnaps [[Moira MacTaggert]] and impersonates her in order to access her research on the [[Legacy Virus]]. Mystique uses samples of the Legacy Virus to create a biological weapon that would infect humans and not mutants, and develops a cure for the Legacy Virus.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

The assassination attempt on Kelly ends in failure when Pyro betrays his teammates. Mystique blows up MacTaggert's research facility, fatally injuring the doctor. Mystique then shoots Moira's foster daughter Wolfsbane with a prototype of Forge's neutralizer gun, depowering her. The X-Men confront Mystique and she is seriously wounded. She tells the X-Men that Destiny had predicted a dark future for mutant-kind, and that the future Destiny foretold kept on unfolding despite all that Mystique had done to prevent it. She believes that the only way to save them is to eradicate all humans.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

Mystique is sent to prison, but quickly escapes. She allies herself with [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]] in an attempt to wrest control of the [[X-Corps]] from its founder, [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]. Outfitted with a device that gives her the ability to generate an electrical charge, Mystique creates the identity of a supervillain named Surge and joins the X-Corps. While Jason mind-controls the other members of the organization, Mystique brings Banshee's organization down and slits his throat, leaving him in critical condition.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

===Double agent===
[[Professor X]] is forced to make Mystique his secret agent, as his previous one, [[Prudence Leighton]], has died and Mystique is the only one suitable to complete the missions. Xavier poses as Magneto to rescue Mystique from the Department of Homeland Security and from execution at the hands of Johny Kitano, Special Magistrate for Homo Superior crimes against humanity, and a mutant himself.<ref name="Mystique #2">''Mystique'' #2</ref> At this time, Mystique claims that there is an imposter out to frame her, taking control over the Brotherhood and sending them on their recent missions (the assassination of Moira and the infiltration of X-Corps). As long as Mystique completes the missions without killing anybody, Xavier, working with Forge, keeps her safe from the authorities, who are out to execute her.

One of Xavier's enemies, the Quiet Man, who is actually Prudence Leighton inhabiting the body of her assassin,<ref name="Mystique24">''Mystique'' #24</ref> contacts Mystique and offers to give her an interference transmitter which would keep her safe from the authorities if she kills Xavier. Creating a plan that would free her from both men, Mystique pretends to try killing Xavier while secretly working with the mutant thief [[Fantomex]], after alerting Forge to stop her at the last moment. Her plan is to have the Quiet Man see this and believe that she really has attempted to kill Xavier and is still working for him. The other X-Men believe that Mystique has tried killing Xavier and seek her out.<ref name="Mystique #23">''Mystique'' #23</ref>

Rogue tracks her down. Distraught with rage, she attacks her foster mother. Mystique escapes by blowing up the house and going through the window, changing her form to shield her fall.<ref name="Mystique #23"/>

Mystique goes to the Quiet Man, who is planning on having her killed. After a battle, Mystique kills the Quiet Man, saves her former field-handler [[Shortpack]], and discovers the Quiet Man's interference transmitter was a fake. She tries to steal Forge's interference transmitter but is caught. After some angry words, he smashes it and tells her he never wants to see her again. The two share a sad goodbye kiss and Mystique leaves. After Mystique is gone, Forge realizes that she had already switched his transmitter for the fake one.<ref name="Mystique24"/>

===Joining the X-Men===
Mystique later infiltrates the X-Men, posing as a young girl named '''Foxx''' and joining [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'s training squad, the Chevaliers.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'', vol. 13 (2010)</ref> She attempts to seduce Rogue's boyfriend Gambit to break them up so she can set her daughter up with a young mutant named [[Pulse (X-Men)|Augustus]],<ref>''X-Men'' #171–174</ref> but Gambit resists. Mystique ultimately reveals herself to him, telling him that she is trying to relieve the tension between him and Rogue (because of the two being unable to touch due to her ability to absorb someone's essence upon skin-to-skin contact). Mystique then metamorphoses into Rogue and tells Gambit that he would not be cheating on Rogue if he had sex with her in Rogue's form.<ref>''X-Men'' #172</ref>

When the telepath [[Emma Frost]] discovers who Foxx really is, the X-Men confront Mystique. Mystique tells them that she had been lonely and wants to join the X-Men. Mystique uses Rogue's doubts about what happened between her and Gambit to sow further discord in Rogue's relationship with Gambit.<ref>''X-Men'' #173–174</ref>

The X-Men vote and decide to have Mystique join them on a probationary status (though Rogue is one of the ones who vote against her joining). Nightcrawler asks her to leave for a while regardless of the vote, saying that he needs more time adjusting to the idea of her being a member. Mystique agrees and leaves.<ref>''X-Men'' #174</ref> After [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], she joins the [[X-Men]] and brings Augustus ([[Pulse (X-Men)|Pulse]]) along with her. Both have been crucial in the downfall of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Marauders===
After the Hecatomb battle on Providence, [[Rogue (comics)#Endangered Species: Rogue's X-Men|Rogue's team]] returns to Rogue's childhood home in Caldecott County, Mississippi, which Mystique owns for some downtime. Mystique alerts the X-Men, who come to treat Rogue's illness, that there are intruders in the area. Only after [[Lady Mastermind]] drops her illusions do the X-Men realize that it is an all-out attack, and that both Lady Mastermind and [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]] (the latter being possessed by [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]]) have defected sides. During the Marauders' initial ambush, Mystique prevents [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]] from shooting Rogue. She then reveals herself as a traitor as well, shoots her adopted daughter, and orders the remaining [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] to kill the X-Men.

Mystique remains with the Marauders during the hunt for the first new mutant baby, but is revealed to have murdered [[Mister Sinister]] in a plot involving the baby and Rogue's killing touch. She also appears to be working with Gambit, who, like her, has ulterior motives to want to betray Mister Sinister. When Sinister approaches Mystique as she is with the comatose Rogue, Mystique shoves Sinister onto Rogue, killing him through fatal skin-to-skin contact. Then, in keeping with the words of the Destiny Diaries, she touches the baby's face to Rogue's. The baby's touch purges her of the Strain 88 virus and all the residual psyches she had absorbed over her life, including Hecatomb. Rogue is sickened by Mystique's manipulations, and leaves.

Wolverine tracks Mystique to the Middle East and then into Afghanistan.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol.3) #62</ref> It is hinted at that Mystique's recent betrayal is not the only reason Logan is out to kill her, as they have a common history of friendship, love, and ultimately, betrayal.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol.3) #63–65</ref> After a heated fight, Wolverine wounds Mystique, but denies her the [[Coup de grâce]].<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol.3) #65</ref>

===''Manifest Destiny''===
Mystique shows up again, posing as Bobby Drake's ex-girlfriend [[Opal Tanaka]]. She sets off a bomb inside of Bobby's Blackbird before shooting him and kicking him out of the plane.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #1</ref> Later, she follows [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] to the hospital and injects him with a fatal dose of a toxin created by [[Mister Sinister]]. Hospital staff try to get to Iceman, but they are held back by Mystique while Iceman expels the toxin from his system.

==Powers and abilities==
Mystique is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] with the ability to psionically shift the formation of her [[cell (biology)|biological cell]]s at will to change her appearance and thereby assume the form of other humans and animals.<ref name="Daken Dark Wolverine #3">''Daken Dark Wolverine'' #3</ref><ref name="Astonishing X-Men #62">''Astonishing X-Men'' #62</ref> She can also alter her voice to duplicate exactly that of another person. Originally, it was clearly stated that Mystique's powers were limited to appearances only; she could not assume the powers of the people she morphed into or alter her body to adapt to different situations. Additionally she could not change her overall body mass when taking on the appearance of a person larger or smaller, but due to subsequent enhancements she has stated that her body mass is not fixed and can change when she does.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #4</ref>

Her body is not limited to purely organic appearances: She also has the ability to create the appearance of clothes and other materials out of her own body, including items such as glasses, zippers, identity cards, handbags and even test tubes.  Mystique is shown in at least one instance transforming a metallic part of her costume into a functioning blaster pistol.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #177</ref> Whether this is a function of her powers or the costume piece itself, is unclear.

As a shape-shifter, Mystique is able to constantly alter and rejuvenate her body's cells and thereby retain her youthful appearance despite being alive for over one hundred years.

Mystique received her first power enhancement in the ''X-Men Forever'' miniseries, in which she was exposed to dangerous levels of radiation in order to save the life of [[Toad (comics)|Toad]]. The process boosted her powers so that she can now morph her body into taking certain desired physical traits depending on her situation at the time. Examples of these new abilities include [[night vision]], [[wing]]s on her back,<ref>''Wolverine'' v4 #9</ref> [[Claw|talons]] in her fingers, and natural body [[armour|armor]].<ref name="Daken Dark Wolverine #3"/> She can compress into nearly two-dimensional like a sheet of paper to glide on air currents, similar to [[Mister Fantastic]], which she uses to survive an explosion.<ref name="Mystique #23"/> She has moved her vital organs out of place in order to survive gunshots to her torso and head,<ref>''Wolverine'' #304''</ref> and can make herself virtually invisible via camouflage. She has even, with strain, given herself two heads and four arms to facilitate a gun fight on two fronts,<ref>''Mystique'' #5</ref> as well as shapeshifted into herself as a small child.<ref name="Mystique #2"/> She is also now able to hold a shape when knocked unconscious<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #50</ref> and can conceal items in shapeshifted pouches under her skin.<ref>''Mystique'' #4</ref>

Following her death and resurrection by the Hand, her powers have been further enhanced.<ref>''Wolverine'' #303</ref> She can now alter and conceal her scent from those with enhanced senses, and is capable of changing her shape to a greater degree, including altering her limbs to form tentacles and bladed weapons,<ref>''Wolverine & the X-Men'' #20</ref> and compressing herself into a dog.<ref name="Astonishing X-Men #62"/>

Damage to her biological tissue is known to heal at a relatively fast rate and she can form a resistance to [[poison]]s upon contacting them. Her enhancements have allowed her to rapidly regrow severed limbs,<ref>''Wolverine'' #12</ref> and rapidly recover from near fatal injury.  Her powers grant her immunity to diseases, enhanced agility and strength, and agelessness.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Mystique is a cunning strategist in terrorist and commando operations, and adept at martial arts and information technology. She has a talent for finding, stealing, and understanding cutting edge weaponry. She is a talented actress and a polyglot, being fluent in over fourteen languages. Her mind is naturally unreadable owing to changing grey matter and she wears devices to prevent telepathic intrusion. Furthermore, with over a century's experience in posing as other people she has picked up the unusual skill of being able to identify people posing as others based on [[body language]] and changes in behavioral cues.

Having been alive a for at least a century, Mystique has built up considerable resources, one of her aliases being the billionaire B Byron Biggs who owns a number of safehouses around the world which are often protected by sophisticated security systems.<ref>''X-Men''(1991) #200</ref> She also controls a variety of weaponry and gadgets, including the ''Changeling'',<ref>''Wolverines'' #1</ref> a highly advanced stealth ship capable of cloaking and flying at very high speed.{{issue|date=January 2019}} The ship had sophisticated weapons and surveillance systems, with an on-board analysis computer and power-suppressing containment cells.

She charges a heavy tariff to ferry the refugees to Avalon, taking all of their valuables. This plagues her conscience and she is reluctant to go to Avalon, as she feels that she is not fit to enter. Ultimately, she gets past her guilt to guide her son, [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Nightcrawler]], to Avalon and find Destiny.

Mystique was subsequently captured and experimented upon, leading to the Sentinels' unstoppable shapeshifting abilities and a dystopian future. The film revolves around Wolverine's attempts to stop her assassination of Trask and avert the dark future after he is sent back in time by [[Kitty Pryde]] projecting him into his younger self. The group stops Mystique's attempt to kill Trask, but the altercation exposes mutants to the world for the first time earlier than in the previous timeline, prompting President Nixon to approve the Sentinel program while Trask studies a blood sample Mystique left behind during the attack. While Trask Industries ships the Sentinels to Washington, D.C. for their national presentation, Magneto secretly surrounds the Sentinels in steel, allowing him to control them. He subsequently commandeers the Sentinels to attack the crowd and hold off Wolverine, Xavier, and McCoy, but before he can kill what he believes to be Nixon (really a disguised Mystique), McCoy suppresses his mutation with a serum causing a Sentinel to turn on Magneto. Magneto quickly disables it, but the distraction allows Mystique to shoot him with a plastic gun, wounding him and releasing his control of the Sentinels. After Xavier convinces Mystique to let Trask live, the world sees that a mutant saved the President and the Sentinel program is shut down. Trask is arrested for selling military secrets to foreign powers, erasing the dystopian future seen earlier in the film. Mystique remains a rogue agent, disguising herself as William Stryker to retrieve Wolverine from the Potomac River.

Despite being idolized by other mutants as a hero, she rejects the notion while focusing simply on getting the oppressed to safety.  Younger mutants like Ororo Munroe, Scott Summers, and Jean Grey see her as an inspiration, and some have begun trying to use their powers for heroics or vigilantism based on her examples. After she sees a news report about the death of Magneto's family while she is trying to help Nightcrawler, she has him take her back to Xavier's mansion so that Xavier can help her find Erik. In the process, she unintentionally alerts the powerful new foe [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] to their existence, prompting him to abduct Xavier. After briefly being held captive by Colonel Stryker, Raven and the other adults are rescued by Scott, Jean, and Nightcrawler, prompting Raven to accompany them on the mission to rescue Xavier from Apocalypse. At the film's conclusion, Mystique returns to the X-Men as one of Xavier's lieutenants (along with Beast) and field commander.
