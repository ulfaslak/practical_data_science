'''Ares''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[deity]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is based on the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Ares|god of the same name]]. He first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' (vol. 1) #129 (June 1966) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. Ares has commonly appeared as an enemy of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and starred in his own [[Ares (comic book)|self-titled series]] in 2006. In 2012, Ares was ranked 39th in [[IGN]]'s list of "The Top 50 Avengers".<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/39 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref>

Ares, the Greek God of War, was initially depicted as a villain in the Marvel Universe, opposing [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Early on his influence on Earth was less direct as he created an organization known as the "Warhawks" and used them to create war on Earth.

In 2006 the character was recast to not be a villain but instead more of an [[antihero]] who simply lived for battle, any battle. He was added to the Avengers roster as one of their "heavy hitters" and showed himself to have his own "Warriors Honor" codex and not the one-dimensional villain he had been portrayed as in the past. He would later join [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark Avengers]], believing that he could put his powers to good use. During the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline Ares is killed by [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] who literally tears him apart. He is later brought back from the dead.

==Publication history==
Ares first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #129, 1966, written by [[Stan Lee]] and drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]. He would often appear as a villain in both ''Thor'' and ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' over the next 30 years.

Since the release of the ''Ares'' miniseries he has been portrayed as an [[antihero]].

Following the superhero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Ares was invited to join the official, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]-sponsored ''[[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]'', led by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], and appeared in that title. He was one of only two members to remain on the team after [[Norman Osborn]] took Stark's position, as part of the [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] storyline and appeared in the first ''[[Dark Avengers]]'' series throughout its run.  Ares subsequently starred in a three-issue ''Dark Avengers: Ares'' miniseries written by [[Kieron Gillen]].<ref>''Dark Avengers: Ares'' #1-3 (October–December 2009)</ref> He appeared as a regular character in the ''Dark Avengers'' series from issue #1 (March 2009) until the time of his death in the ''Siege'' limited series.

During the "[[Chaos War]]" storyline, Ares appeared in a one-shot comic titles ''Chaos War: Ares''.

==Fictional character biography==
Ares is the son of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] and is the [[Mount Olympus|Olympian]] God of War. Ares reveled in war and combat in all its forms, not caring about sides or victims, supporting Troy in the Trojan war. Ares has hated [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] ever since Hercules killed Ares' pets, the monstrous [[Stymphalian birds]],<ref>Greek Mythology</ref> and his hatred increased when he noticed Hercules being favored by their father, while he was shunned for his brutal behavior.  Further adding to his hatred, is that in modern times, war is shunned and disliked, whereas Hercules is still beloved by the masses, despite his own history of death and destruction.<ref>as noted in ''Incredible Hercules'' #115</ref> As the Romans took on worship of Greek gods and renamed them, Ares is also the deity Mars.

After Zeus allowed the worship of the Greek/Roman gods to cease, the dissatisfied Ares held a deep grudge and would try to overthrow Olympus more than once. He refused to battle against [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]] on behalf of Hercules, and aided Pluto instead. Hercules teamed up with the [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardian]] god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in order to defeat Ares, leading to Ares' retreat.<ref>''Thor'' #129</ref> Ares fought a duel with Hercules, forming an alliance with the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] to make Hercules her slave and ally against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] using water from the Spring of Eros, which led to Hercules being exiled from Olympus for a year.<ref>''Avengers'' #38</ref>

Ares organized the Warhawks, which included Satyrs whose pipes caused violence in humans, and with them battled the Avengers. He dispatched Kratos and Bia to capture Hercules. After allying with the Enchantress again, he used the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]'s [[Ebony Blade]] to quench the Promethean Flame and conquer Olympus, by turning all the other Olympians to crystal, although Hercules was not transformed, but exiled to Earth with amnesia, due to being brutally beaten by Ares' henchman the Yellow-crested Titans and drifting between Olympus and Earth for six days and nights. Ares sent the two gods, Kratos and Bia, after Hercules, and despite the Avenger's efforts Hercules was captured and taken back to Olympus. Ares again battled the Avengers who had come to rescue the captive Hercules, and was defeated by Thor and the Black Knight.<ref>''Avengers'' #98-100</ref>

Ares also battled [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]].<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #57</ref> He formed another alliance with Pluto, and kidnapped Krista in an attempt to foment war between Olympus and [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''Thor'' 221-222</ref> He also plotted with Pluto and Ares' daughter [[Hippolyta (Marvel Comics)|Hippolyta]] to marry Hercules and Venus to Hippolyta and himself.<ref>''Champions'' #1-3</ref>

It was revealed that in ancient times, he took part in the [[Trojan War]].<ref>''Thor Annual'' #8</ref> Alongside Zeus, Ares struck an alliance with [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] against the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]],<ref>''Thor'' #289</ref> and battled the Eternal [[Ikaris]].<ref>''Thor'' #291</ref>

He frequently battled teams and individuals while working as a villain, and continued to battle heroes like the Avengers.<ref>such as in ''Hercules and the Heart of Chaos'' #1-3</ref>

Ares' uncle [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]] sought to overwhelm [[Mount Olympus]] with an army of the [[dead]], leading to a [[stalemate]] that the [[deity|gods]] and demigods (including [[Achilles]]) were unable to break. In desperation to end the [[siege]] of [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]], Zeus called upon his son Ares who defeated Hades' army almost single-handedly. Hoping that this would allow him to join his kind in Olympus, Ares was disappointed to hear his parents and the other gods disparage his "crude" and "dishonorable" nature. He abandoned his brethren to live amongst mortal men, but did not completely give up his god nature yet.<ref name="ares1">''Ares'' #1</ref>

Ares tired of his own warmongering when he realized that was why the other gods despised him and decided to live a normal life. He gave up his position as god of war, but maintained his skills, weaponry, and immortality. On Earth, he set himself up as a [[Construction worker|builder]]/[[carpenter]]. He would later father a son with an unidentified mother.<ref name="ares1"/>

After the events of the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]] and [[Iron Man]] recruit Ares as part of the new [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #1</ref> He plays a major part in defeating Ultron. During the [[Secret Invasion]], Ares' son Alexander was recruited for [[Nick Fury]]'s [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]], by [[Daisy Johnson]], to oppose the Skrull [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] of [[New York City]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #13</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Ares has joined the [[Dark Avengers]], [[Norman Osborn]]'s personal team of Avengers.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1</ref> Writer of the ''Dark Avengers'' series, [[Brian Michael Bendis]], described Ares' role: "Ares is going to be a big part of this book. He's really going to step up and use his War God brain."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19645 THE OSBORN SUPREMACY: Dark Avengers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603233529/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19645 |date=June 3, 2016 }}, [[Comic Book Resources]], January 22, 2008</ref> During The [[Dark Avengers]]' first mission, "[[Mac Gargan|Venom-Spidey]]" is turned into a monster by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]]. Venom (under her control) attempts to eat Ares.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #2</ref> He is spit back out but is turned to stone shortly thereafter by Morgana.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #3</ref> He returns to normal when Morgana is defeated by Dr. Doom in her own time.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #4</ref> Ares later receives a truancy notice in the mail regarding his son.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #5</ref> Deciding to investigate as best he can, he sends Alex to school, only to see him board [[Daisy Johnson]]'s scooter on the way to a new base for the Secret Warriors. Ares tails them on his motorcycle and rampages his way in through the wall. When Hellfire tries to attack, Ares easily dispatches him and in their own silent way, Nick Fury and Ares ask for a private audience with one another. Ares then uncharacteristically declares himself a horrid father, but only aims to raise Alex differently than he and his father were raised. He then peacefully leaves the place behind, allowing Alex the opportunity to not have to hide his allegiance anymore.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #9</ref>

When the Dark Avengers and H.A.M.M.E.R. go to San Francisco to quell the riots, Ares was stomping out a group of pro-mutant activists. [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] challenged him but was easily dispatched. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] tried absorbing his powers which prove too much for her but nonetheless she manages to weaken him. [[Danger Room|Danger]], fearing that Rogue might injure herself threw an energized [[manhole]] at Ares, pushing him away from Rogue. She gained half of Ares' power as a result. The trio then hijack a H.A.M.M.E.R. tank and leave a bleeding Ares behind.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #226</ref>

Ares, having recovered from his injuries, is seen next during the Dark Avengers' assault on the X-Men's new base [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]] (which was made from the remains of the first [[Asteroid M]]). There he fights with several X-Men until he is confronted with the once more empowered valkyrie [[Danielle Moonstar]]. The two fight and are evenly matched with Dani quickly gaining the upper hand due to having borrowed some power from [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] the Asgardian death Goddess. Eventually both he and his team of Avengers are forced to retreat.<ref>''Dark Avengers-Uncanny X-Men - Exodus'' #001</ref>

Before the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' begins, Osborn is seen trying to convince Ares to come up with a plan to invade Asgard, saying [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] has taken control of it. Even though Osborn promises Ares that nothing is wrong, Ares tells Osborn that if he is lying, he will 'cut his head off, armour and all'.<ref>''Siege'' #1</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24329 |title=STORMING HEAVEN: "Siege" #1 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] News |date=January 7, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}</ref> Once the  Siege of Asgard begins, as the battle intensifies, Ares finds himself battling [[Balder (comics)|Balder]] and learns from Heimdall about Osborn's deceptions. When Osborn dispatches [[Daken]] to find [[Maria Hill]], he is struck down by Ares, who vows to kill Osborn for his lies. However, Ares is suddenly attacked by the Sentry and a brutal battle ensues, in which Ares is wounded while barely doing any damage to Sentry. The battle then comes to a violent conclusion when the Sentry rips Ares in half before the horrified eyes of the combatants on both sides.<ref>''Siege'' #2</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24874 |title=STORMING HEAVEN: "Siege" #2 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] News |date=February 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}</ref> Alexander, after finding out about his father's death, recalls a time when he asked Ares if they would always be together, Ares responded that, as they are gods, they can be killed, but they "will never truly die" and tells him that he has experienced "this many, many times", having been "to Hades and through the Underworld to awaken in the fair Fields of Elysium...". Ares tells Alexander that he would one day die, but promises him that he will always find him again.<ref>''Siege: Secret Warriors'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Ares is among the dead beings released by Pluto in order to defend the Underworld from the forces of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]], but is ultimately defeated and enslaved bodily by the Chaos King along with his fallen parents Zeus and Hera.<ref>''Chaos War'' #2</ref> Despite the combined attacks of the newly assembled God Squad, Ares is unscathed and engages Hercules in direct combat as Zeus and Hera battle Galactus and the other members of the God Squad.<ref>''Chaos War'' #3</ref> Ares ultimately returned to the underworld with the rest of the dead.<ref>''Chaos War'' #5</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Ares and Alexander (who had been killed by [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]]) are later seen residing in the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]]. However, Ares is kidnapped and forcibly resurrected by agents of [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]] in order to serve as one of the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]'s fighters in the new [[Marvel: Contest of Champions#Contest of Champions (2015)|Contest of Champions]].<ref>''Contest of Champions'' vol. 2 #1</ref> Though Ares agrees to go along with the tournament, [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] claims that he is simply biding his time until he can find a way to kill Collector and Maestro.<ref>''Contest of Champions'' vol. 2 #2</ref> After the Maestro is defeated, Ares chooses to travel the world with his new friends, stating that he wishes to have a whole host of new adventures to tell Phobos about when he returns to the Elysian Fields one day.<ref>''Contest of Champions'' (vol. 2) #10</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Ares appears as a member of the Champions of Europe alongside [[Captain Britain]], [[Faiza Hussain|Excalibur]], [[Guillotine (comics)|Guillotine]], [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]], and [[Peregrine (comics)|Peregrine]].<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ares belongs to a race of inter-dimensional deities known only as the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympians]]. He possesses the base superhuman physical attributes of an Olympian, including superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, reflexes, and virtual immortality, though some of his powers are substantially greater than most other Olympians.

Like all Olympians, Ares is superhumanly strong, though far more so than the majority of his race. Among the Olympians, his physical strength is equaled only by his uncles, [[Neptune (Marvel Comics)|Neptune]] and [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]], and is exceeded only by his father, [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]], and his half-brother, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. Ares' body and metabolism generates almost no fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting him virtually inexhaustible superhuman stamina in all physical activities. Ares' body is also highly resistant to physical injury. He can withstand great impact forces, energy discharges, temperature extremes, and falls from great heights without being injured. However, also like all other Olympians, he can sustain injury; once, after an extensive self-imposed exile on the Earthly plane, Ares was physically vulnerable enough to be injured and downed by mere bullets.<ref>''Ares: God of War''</ref> At the same time Ares has been shown withstanding being shot at point-blank range from machine guns used by War Machine.<ref>''War Machine #3''</ref>  Ares is functionally immortal in the sense that he is immune to the effects of aging and hasn't aged since reaching adulthood. He is also immune to any known terrestrial disease or infection.

While not as accomplished at magic as many of his fellow Olympians, and lacking the ability to fly,<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #114</ref> or to project energy,<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Hardcover Vol. 1''</ref> as an Olympian god Ares has the potential to use magic. Ares can sense the presence of other gods, demons, and the use of magic, call other gods,  and transport himself to Olympus and to Earth at will on certain occasions (such as abandoning his station as the God of War to lead a mortal life, or when retreating to Olympus after Hercules wounded him in a fierce battle with Kyknos).<ref>''The Incredible Hercules'' #116</ref> However, neither his rudimentary magic nor his Olympian natural abilities were capable of overwhelming the [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]]-tutored [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] or preventing the mistress of the mystic arts from easily transmuting him into stone.

He is, as fits his station as the Olympian God of War, a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, possessing fighting skills superior to that of even his father Zeus and his sister [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]]; [[Nate Grey]] described him as "war personified, on every plane...in every future" and admits that even he can find nothing to counter one such as Ares; when Nate hid himself and [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] "amongst time", Ares was able to tear through the fabric of time itself to reach and overpower him (claiming that such could not "limit" him), the temporal conflict sending ripples across the stars and disrupting the timestream itself.<ref>''Dark X-Men'' #3</ref> In another instance, apparently without aid, Ares was able to somehow bring himself and Alexander to another dimension, where many gods of Earth, including the Council of Skyfathers, had convened to judge his son's worthiness as the 'God of Fear'.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #10</ref> Ares was also able to somehow create the man-eating [[Stymphalian birds]] "as a perfect expression of his own essence" ages ago,<ref>''Thor and Hercules: Encyclopedia Mythologica'' #1</ref> and was also able to send his son Monstro from 1805 through time into the mid-20th century as punishment for his renouncing war and change him into a sixty-foot tall giant.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Hardcover Vol. 14''</ref> He is also an expert with numerous weapons, including ancient weapons and conventional, modern-day firearms. In his earlier appearances, he typically carried Olympian weapons like battleaxes, spears, swords, daggers, and a javelin (which has been said to at least once be his "favorite" weapon), but his most recent appearance shows him favoring a mixture of ancient, like the jawbone of an ass, and modern weapons, like gases, rays, firearms, and high-explosives, as well as "Hydra blood bullets", which contain the lethal blood of a [[Lernaean Hydra]]. He is an aficionado, expert, and collector of the most unusual instruments and methods of death dealing, as well as being well-versed in torture, interrogation, and combat tactics.

==Other versions==

In the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, the reality that formed from Wolverine and Invisible Woman killing Henry Pym to prevent Ultron from being created shows that Ares has become the new Doctor Doom after the original died and is engaged to [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] where they have conquered half the planet. Hippolyta defeats Ares and takes back command of the Amazons (who were subdued by Ares).<ref>''Fearless Defenders'' #4AU</ref>
