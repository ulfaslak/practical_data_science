'''Kamala Khan''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by editors [[Sana Amanat]] and Stephen Wacker, writer [[G. Willow Wilson]] and artist [[Adrian Alphona]], Khan is Marvel's first [[Muslim]] character to headline her own comic book. Khan made her first appearance in ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' #14 (August [[2013 in comics|2013]]) before going on to star in the solo series ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'', which debuted in February 2014.

Within the [[Marvel Universe]], Khan is a teenage [[Pakistani American]] from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] with [[shapeshifting]] abilities who discovers that she has [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] genes in the aftermath of the "[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]" storyline and assumes the mantle of '''Ms. Marvel''' from her [[Teen idol|idol]] [[Carol Danvers]] after Danvers becomes Captain Marvel. Marvel's announcement that a Muslim character would headline a comic book was met with widespread reaction and the first volume of ''Ms. Marvel'' won the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story|best graphic story]] in 2015.

==Publication history==
In November 2013, [[Marvel Comics]] announced that Kamala Khan, a teenage [[Islam in the United States|American Muslim]] from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], would take over the comic book series ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' beginning in February 2014. The series, written by [[G. Willow Wilson]] and drawn by [[Adrian Alphona]], marked the first time a Muslim character headlined a book at Marvel Comics.<ref name="Marvel">{{cite web |last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |date=November 6, 2013|title=All-New Marvel NOW!

Amanat said, "I was telling him [Wacker] some crazy anecdote about my childhood, growing up as a Muslim American. He found it hilarious."

They wanted the costume to represent her cultural identity, but did not want her to wear a [[hijab]]. Amanat also stated that they wanted the character to look "less like a sex siren" to appeal to a more vocal female readership.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dev |first=Arun |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/American-Muslims-were-proud-of-Kamala-Khan/articleshow/42473218.cms |title='American Muslims were proud of Kamala Khan' |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cJle48Mr?url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/American-Muslims-were-proud-of-Kamala-Khan/articleshow/42473218.cms |archivedate=October 16, 2015 |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=September 15, 2014 |accessdate=October 16, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>

Marvel knew that they wanted a young Muslim girl, but stated that she could be from any place of origin and have any background. Wilson initially considered making her an [[Arabs|Arab]] girl from [[Dearborn, Michigan]] but ultimately chose to create a [[Desi]] girl from Jersey City.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ali |first=Dilshad D. |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/altmuslim/2013/11/interview-g-willow-wilson-on-the-creation-of-the-newest-muslim-american-comic-superhero/ |title=Interview: G.

Wilson explains, "A huge aspect of Ms. Marvel is being a 'second string hero' in the 'second string city' and having to struggle out of the pathos and emotion that can give a person."<ref name="Newsarama"/>

The series not only explores Khan's conflicts with supervillains but also explores conflicts with Khan's home and religious duties. Wilson, a convert to Islam, said "This is not evangelism. It was really important for me to portray Kamala as someone who is struggling with her faith." Wilson continued, "Her brother is extremely conservative, her mom is paranoid that she's going to touch a boy and get pregnant, and her father wants her to concentrate on her studies and become a doctor."<ref name="NYTimes" /> Amanat added, <blockquote>As much as Islam is a part of Kamala's identity, this book isn't preaching about religion or the Islamic faith in particular. It's about what happens when you struggle with the labels imposed on you, and how that forms your sense of self. It's a struggle we've all faced in one form or another, and isn't just particular to Kamala because she's Muslim. Her religion is just one aspect of the many ways she defines herself.<ref name="Marvel" /></blockquote>

[[File:First appearance of Kamala Khan.jpg|thumb|left|First appearance of Kamala Khan from ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' #14 (August 2013) by [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] and Scott Hepburn]]
In the series, Khan takes the name Ms. Marvel from [[Carol Danvers]], who now goes by the alias [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. ''Captain Marvel'' writer [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] revealed that Khan actually made a brief appearance in ''Captain Marvel'' #14 (August 2013) saying, "Kamala is in the background of a scene in ''Captain Marvel'' 14 ... She is very deliberately placed in a position where she sees Carol protecting civilians from [[Yon-Rogg]]."<ref>{{cite AV media |last=Thompson |first=Kelly |date=2013-11-18 |title=3 Chicks Review Comics – Episode 064 | medium=[[Podcast]] |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/11/18/3-chicks-review-comics-episode-064/ |accessdate=2013-12-06 |format=[[MP3]] |time =1:37:40 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref> According to Wilson, Khan idolizes Carol so when Khan acquires superhuman abilities, she emulates Danvers.<ref name="Newsarama">{{cite web |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=November 6, 2013 |title=G.

"Khan is a big comic book fan and after she discovers her superhuman power – being a polymorph and able to lengthen her arms and legs and change her shape – she takes on the name of Ms. Marvel," Amanat elaborated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reaney |first=Patricia |date=November 5, 2013 |title=Pow!

In the series' first story arc, Khan faces off against Mr. Edison / the Inventor, an amalgam of man and bird. Wilson created the Inventor to be Khan's first arch rival in order to mirror Khan's own complexity. Wilson characterizes the Inventor, and the overall visual look of the opening story arc as "kooky and almost [[Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]-esque at times", owing to the art style of illustrator [[Adrian Alphona]], which balances the drama of the threats which Khan faces with the humor of Alphona's "tongue in cheek sight gags." During the storyline, Khan also [[team-up|teams-up]] with the X-Man [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] against the Inventor. Because Wolverine is dealing with the [[Death of Wolverine|loss of his healing factor]] during this time, Khan is placed in the position of having to shoulder much of the responsibilities, as Wilson felt this was a role reversal that would subvert reader expectations that Wolverine would take the lead in such a team-up.<ref>{{cite web |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=July 16, 2014 |title=Heroic Identity of Wilson's "Ms. Marvel" Continues To Take Shape |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=54112 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref>

At the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], writer [[Dan Slott]] announced that Khan would team-up with [[Spider-Man]] beginning in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #7 (October 2014) during the "[[Spider-Verse]]" storyline. Slott characterized Khan "the closest character to classic Peter Parker,"<ref>{{cite web |last=Manning |first=Shaun |date=July 25, 2014 |title=SDCC: Across the Spider-Verse |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=54330 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref> explaining, "She's a teenage superhero, juggling her life, making mistakes, trying to do everything right."<ref>{{cite web |last=Ching |first=Albert |date=October 12, 2014 |title=NYCC: Marvel's "Spider-Verse" Panel, "Spider-Gwen" and "Silk" Ongoings Announced |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=56244 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref>

Beginning in June 2015, ''Ms. Marvel'' tied into the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover event]] with the "Last Days" storyline, which details Khan's account of the end of the [[Marvel Universe]]. Wilson explained, "In the 'Last Days' story arc, Kamala has to grapple with the end of everything she knows, and discover what it means to be a hero when your whole world is on the line."<ref>{{cite web |last=Damore |first=Meagan |date=February 19, 2015 |title="Ms. Marvel," "Silver Surfer" and More Face Their Last Days |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=59452 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref> In the storyline, Khan rushes to deal with the threat in Manhattan. However, Wilson revealed, "She will face a very personal enemy as the chaos in Manhattan spills over into Jersey City, and she will be forced to make some very difficult choices. There will also be a very special guest appearance by a superhero Kamala—and the fans—have been waiting to meet for a long time."<ref>{{cite web |last=Lovett |first=Jaime |date=February 19, 2015 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Ms Marvel Enters Her Last Days |url=http://comicbook.com/2015/02/18/exclusive-ms-marvel-enters-her-last-days/ |publisher=comicbook.com |accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref>

In March 2015, Marvel announced that Khan will join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''All-New All-Different Avengers'' [[Free Comic Book Day|FCBD]] (May 2015) by writer [[Mark Waid]] and artists [[Adam Kubert]] and [[Mahmud Asrar]], which takes place in the aftermath of "Secret Wars".<ref>{{cite web |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=March 24, 2015 |title=MARVEL Begins To Unveil ALL-NEW ALL-DIFFERENT AVENGERS |url=http://www.newsarama.com/23888-marvel-begins-to-unveil-all-new-all-different-avengers-title-for-fcbd.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref> A second volume of ''Ms. Marvel'' starring Khan by Wilson, Alphona and [[Takeshi Miyazawa]] is also debuted following "Secret Wars" as part of Marvel's [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] initiative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/marvel-just-revealed-its-entire-all-new-all-different-1714899675|title=Marvel Just Revealed Its Entire "All-New, All-Different" Comic Universe|publisher=[[Io9]]|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}</ref> Amanat said, <blockquote>By the time this new launch comes around, it will have been almost two years since the premiere of ''Ms. Marvel''—and boy, has Kamala Khan been through a lot since then. She's been slowly coming into her own, dealing with the challenges of navigating adulthood and being a super hero. But her training is over now and it's time for the big leagues; the question is can she handle it? ... As much as Kamala has a right to be there—it's still a bit of a culture shock. Dreaming of being an Avenger and then suddenly being one is a lot to take on for someone of her age.

In March 2016, Marvel announced that ''Ms. Marvel'' would tie into the "[[Civil War II]]" storyline by releasing a promotional image illustrating a rift between Khan and Danvers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dickens |first=Donna |date=March 10, 2016 |title=Exclusive: Kamala Khan must choose a side in Marvel's CIVIL WAR II |url=http://www.hitfix.com/harpy/exclusive-kamala-khan-must-choose-a-side-in-marvels-civil-war-ii |publisher=HitFix |accessdate=May 25, 2016}}</ref> "While "Civil War II" may have initiated this rift, we've known for some time that Kamala would eventually need to separate herself from her idols. Her journey centers around self-discovery and identity, and a part of that exploration includes separating yourself from those you put on pedestals. The rift between Carol and Kamala doesn't really have to do with right and wrong. It has to do with growing up and realizing that you perceive the world differently from even the ones you love," Amanat elaborated.<ref name="Marvel_NOW!">{{cite web |last=Cooke |first=Sarah |date=September 12, 2016 |title=Marvel NOW!

In July, Marvel announced that Khan will join the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]], a team of teenage superheroes who split off from the Avengers following the conclusion of "Civil War II". The team, featured in a series by writer [[Mark Waid]] and artist [[Humberto Ramos]], consists of Khan, [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)]], [[Nova (Sam Alexander)]], [[Amadeus Cho|Hulk (Amadeus Cho)]], [[Viv Vision]], and a teenage version of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)#Time-displaced Cyclops|Cyclops]]. Waid said, "The first three are the kids who quit the Avengers proper. That was an easy get. Those three, in and of themselves, form a nice little subteam. Their dynamic is great. They all show up in each other's books, and even though they have their arguments and stress points, clearly they're good together."<ref>{{cite web |last=Holub |first=Christian |date=July 5, 2016 |title=Marvel's young superheroes channel their activist sides in new series Champions |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/05/marvel-champions |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=July 5, 2016}}</ref>

In August, Khan made an appearance in ''[[Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur]]'' #10 by writers [[Amy Reeder]] and [[Brandon Montclare]]. In the issue, Khan acts as a mentor to Moon Girl (Lunella Lafayette) who is also a young Inhuman that suddenly came into her powers. Amanat stated that Khan sees much of herself in Lafayette and by teaching her, Khan learns much about herself.<ref name="Marvel_NOW!" />

In November, Marvel announced that Khan will join a new incarnation of the [[Secret Warriors (2017 series)|Secret Warriors]] in a series by writer [[Matthew Rosenberg]] and artist [[Javier Garron]] that debuted in May 2017. The team, formed in the wake of the "[[Inhumans vs X-Men]]" storyline, also includes [[Daisy Johnson|Quake]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], Moon Girl, and Devil Dinosaur. Rosenberg stated that there is some conflict and friction amongst the team members explaining, "Ms. Marvel and Quake are really fighting for the soul of the team in a lot of ways, while Moon Girl will continue to really do her own thing. They will all be tested and challenged, they are superheroes after all, but they are going to do things their way."<ref>{{cite web |last=Richards|first=Dave |date=November 23, 2016 |title=EXCLUSIVE: New Team of Secret Warriors Gathers for Marvel's ResurrXion |url=http://www.cbr.com/exclusive-secret-warriors-marvels-resurrxion/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=February 21, 2016}}</ref>

In March 2017, Marvel announced that Khan would team-up with Danvers in an [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue of the [[Limited series (comics)|limited]] [[Comics anthology|anthology series]], ''[[Generations (comics)|Generations]]'' by Wilson and Paolo Villanelle. Wilson stated that the issue would explore Danvers' and Khan's mentor–student relationship, but "at its heart, [it] is about growing up, and a big part of growing up is discovering that your idols have [[feet of clay]] – and forgiving them for their flaws as you gain an adult understanding of your own."<ref name="ABCNews">{{cite web |date=March 24, 2017 |last=Rothman |first=Michael |title=Marvel's 'Generations': Original Wolverine, Hulk, Iron Man and more to return  |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/marvels-generations-original-wolverine-hulk-iron-man-return/story?id=46331912 |work=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>

In December, ''Ms. Marvel'' began the "Teenage Wasteland" story arc, as part of the [[Marvel Legacy]] relaunch. Wilson said, "Since the events of 'Civil War II', there's been friction between Kamala and her mentor, Captain Marvel. In this arc, we're exploring how complicated legacies can be when they're passed from generation to generation ... She's questioning a lot about herself and her mission. Her friends end up stepping into some very important—and unexpected—roles. So in a sense, the arc is really about a bunch of chronically under-estimated teenagers who pull together to fight evil."<ref>{{cite web |last=Marston |first=George |date=September 15, 2017 |title=MS.

''Ms. Marvel'' #31, the 50th issue of ''Ms. Marvel'' featuring Khan was released in June 2018. To mark the occasion, Marvel brought in additional collaborators for the issue including writers: G. Willow Wilson, [[Saladin Ahmed]], [[Rainbow Rowell]], and [[Hasan Minhaj]]; and artists: [[Nico Leon]], Bob Quinn, [[Gustavo Duarte]], and [[Elmo Bondoc]].<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=June 5, 2018 |title=MS.

In 2019, Khan is scheduled to headline a new series titled, ''The Magnificent Ms. Marvel'', written by Ahmed and illustrated by [[Minkyu Jung]]. Wilson stated that she had been planning her departure from the series for over a year, stating that she originally anticipated that the series would only last for ten issues and was excited by the fact that she had written 60 issues. Ahmad said the new series will have much wider scope, "while still maintaining that intimate tone that people have loved about it."<ref>{{cite web |last=Holub |first=Christian |date=December 14, 2018 |title=Ms. Marvel is getting a new comic with a new creative team in 2019 |url=https://ew.com/books/2018/12/14/ms-marvel-new-comic-new-creative-team/ |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref>

==Reception==

===Initial reaction===
Marvel's announcement was met with widespread reactions online. Fatemeh Fakhraie, founder of ''Muslimah Media Watch'', a diversity [[advocacy group]], told [[Al Jazeera America]] that "She is going to be a window into the American Muslim experience" and that she "normalizes this idea of the American experience as Muslim."<ref>{{cite news |last=De Bode |first=Lisa |date=November 5, 2013 |title=Ms. Marvel returns as Muslim teen |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/11/5/ms-marvel-returnsasmuslimteen.html |work=[[Al Jazeera America]] |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Brett White of [[Comic Book Resources]] said, "With Kamala Khan, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants living in Jersey City, Marvel Comics has shown yet again that it wants to include groups of the American population that have yet to be personally inspired by their heroes."<ref>{{cite web |last=White |first=Brett |date=November 6, 2013 |title=In Your Face Jam: Ms. Marvel Is Important |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48963 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Hussein Rashid writing for [[CNN]] said, "The character of Kamala Khan has the opportunity to offer something new to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims.

However, Dr. Leon Moosavi of the [[University of Liverpool]] felt that the character's family would reinforce the stereotype of restrictive Muslim parents and that her shape-shifting ability resembled several anti-Muslim stereotypes, especially [[taqiyya]]:<ref>{{cite news |last=Moosavi |first=Leon |date=November 27, 2013 |title=Why can't Spider-Man convert to Islam? |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/11/why-can-spiderman-convert-islam-20131122115933370663.html |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |accessdate=November 29, 2013}}</ref> a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts while they are at risk of significant persecution.<ref name=StewartNYUEssay>{{cite web |title=Islam in Spain after the Reconquista |url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/program/neareast/test/andalusia/2_p8_text.html |first=Devin |last=Stewart |work=Teaching Materials |publisher=The Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at [[New York University]] |accessdate=6 August 2012}}</ref>

Political satirist [[Stephen Colbert]], who portrayed a parody of right-wing commentators on his show ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', remarked, "A Muslim cannot be a superhero — for Pete's sake they're on the no-fly list."<ref>{{cite news |last=Maglio |first=Tony |date=November 7, 2013 |title=Stephen Colbert on New Ms. Marvel: 'Muslim Cannot Be a Superhero ...

===Critical reaction===
Meagan Damore of ''Comic Book Resources'' said, "There is nothing not to love about ''Ms. Marvel'' #1: every character is well formed and distinct; the story, lovingly crafted; the art, meticulously planned and—at times—downright funny."<ref>{{cite web |last=Damore |first=Meagan |date=February 6, 2014 |title=Ms. Marvel #1 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=6953 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref> Jen Aprahamian of ''[[Comic Vine]]'' said "''Ms. Marvel'' makes a delightful debut, showing confidence and heart even before she puts on a mask. Kamala is not your average superheroine and her stories seem like they're headed in an exciting direction.

Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona, but for Marvel Comics itself ... It's not exactly edgy, and Kamala Khan is not exactly the first reluctant teen hero in Marvel's long history, but Ms. Marvel is one of the strongest debuts for a new character that Marvel has had in a long time."<ref>{{cite web |last=Marston |first=George |date=February 3, 2014 |title=Best Shots Advance Reviews: MS.

==Cultural impact==

* In January 2015, images of Khan began appearing over anti-Islamic advertisements on San Francisco city buses. The advertisements, purchased by the [[Stop Islamization of America|American Freedom Defense Initiative]], equated Islam with [[Nazism]]. In response, street artists covered the ads with images of Khan alongside messages such as "Calling all Bigotry Busters," "Stamp out racism," "Free speech isn't a license to spread hate," "Islamophobia hurts us all," and "Racist." About the response, Wilson tweeted, "Some amazing person has been painting over the anti-Muslim bus ads in SF with Ms. Marvel graffiti ... To me, the graffiti is part of the back-and-forth of the free speech conversation. Call and response. Argument, counterargument."<ref>{{cite news |last=Kai-Hwa Wang |first=Frances |date=January 27, 2015 |title=Comic Heroine Ms. Marvel Saves San Francisco From Anti-Islam Ads |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/comic-heroine-ms-marvel-saves-san-francisco-anti-islam-ads-n294751 |work=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref>

* In October 2016, Khan appeared on the cover of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' in an illustration by [[Autumn Whitehearst]] that pays homage to [[J. Howard Miller]]'s "[[We Can Do It!]]" poster. The cover is accompanied by an article by Mallika Rao titled "The Super Hero For Our Times: Ms. Marvel Will Save You Now" that profiles Wilson, with a focus on the increasing diversity of comic book characters, creators, and fans.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cave |first=Rob |date=October 6, 2016 |title=Ms Marvel Becomes Village Voice Cover Star |url=http://www.cbr.com/ms-marvel-becomes-village-voice-cover-star/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=October 6, 2016}}</ref>
* In March 2018, [[Merriam-Webster]] added 850 words to their dictionary, including the word "Embiggen". "Embiggen," which first appeared in the lexicon in a 1996 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', was popularized in the pages of ''Ms. Marvel'' as a way Khan describes her shape-shifting powers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carter |first=Justin |date=March 5, 2018 |title=Merriam-Webster Declares Ms. Marvel's 'Embiggen' Is a Real Word |url=https://www.cbr.com/ms-marvel-embiggen-merriam-webster/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=March 6, 2018}}</ref>

==Other versions==
* An older version of Khan appears in ''[[Inhumans|Inhumans: Attilan Rising]]'' by [[Charles Soule]] and John Timms as part of the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, which details [[Black Bolt]]'s rebellion against [[Medusa (comics)|Queen Medusa]] of [[Attilan|New Attilan]]. In her review of ''Inhumans: Attilan Rising'' #2, Emma Houxbois of The Rainbow Hub said, "While [Khan has] had a few chances to shine in the core ''Inhuman'' book, her reintroduction (complete with character redesign by Dave Johnson and strong line work by John Timms) packs a real punch. Soule's evolution of her powers and costume will hopefully also coincide with further opportunities later in the story to learn more about her views on the resistance and reasons for supporting Attilan – solidifying this version of Kamala as a comparatively matured hero forced to make difficult moral choices."<ref>{{cite web |last=Houxbois |first=Emma |date=June 13, 2015 |title=Attilan Rising #2: Review |url=http://www.therainbowhub.com/attilan-rising-2-review/ |publisher=The Rainbow Hub |accessdate=July 16, 2015}}</ref>

* Another future version of Khan appears in ''[[All-New Wolverine]]'' #33 (April 2018) by [[Tom Taylor]] and [[Ramon Rosanas]] as part of the "Old Woman Laura" storyline as the future [[President of the United States]]. Kieran Shiach of Comic Book Resources said, "Kamala as President of the United States makes a lot of sense. She's smart, resourceful and cares about her community ... It also helps solidify the world of "Old Woman Laura" as a 'good future,' presenting a President who is both a woman and Muslim as a possibility within our lifetime."<ref>{{cite web |last=Shiach |first=Kieran |date=April 6, 2018 |title=Wolverine's 'Old Woman Laura' Introduces A Familiar, Superheroic President |url=https://www.cbr.com/wolverine-president-ms-marvel-kamala-khan/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=April 18, 2018}}</ref>

==In other media==
In September 2016, Marvel Creative Consultant [[Joe Quesada]] stated that Ms. Marvel would appear in "other media" as result of the character's quick success amongst readers, which he noted "doesn't happen a lot" and acknowledged that it probably would not have happened ten years ago.<ref>{{cite web |last=Couto |first=Anthony |date=September 6, 2016 |title=Quesada on Marvel's Diverse Audience, Ms. Marvel's Future in TV & Film  |url=http://www.cbr.com/quesada-on-marvels-diverse-audience-ms-marvels-future-in-tv-film/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref>

In August 2015, [[GraphicAudio]] released ''Ms. Marvel: No Normal'', which adapts the first-five issues of the comic book series into audio format. Marvel and GraphicAudio have collaborated before in the past but ''Ms. Marvel: No Normal'' marks the first time that they have adapted an audiobook straight from a comic book. Jeff Reingold Marvel's Manager of Licensed Publishing said, "The challenge here was conveying the comic visuals into a strictly audio form without the use of a third-person narrator."<ref>{{cite web |last=Towers |first=Andrea |date=August 17, 2015 |title=GraphicAudio brings Kamala Khan to life in Ms. Marvel: No Normal |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/17/graphicaudio-releases-ms-marvel-audiobook |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref>
