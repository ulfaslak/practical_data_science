'''Beast''' ('''Henry Philip''' "'''Hank'''" '''McCoy''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]] and is a founding member of the [[X-Men]]. Originally called "The Beast", the character was introduced as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] possessing ape-like superhuman physical strength and agility, oversized hands and feet, a [[genius]]-level intellect, and otherwise normal appearance and speech. Eventually being referred to simply as "Beast", Hank McCoy underwent progressive physiological transformations, permanently gaining animalistic physical characteristics. These include blue fur, both [[simian]] and [[felidae|feline]] facial features, pointed ears, fangs, and claws. Beast's physical strength and [[sense]]s increased to even greater levels.

Despite Hank McCoy's inhuman appearance, he is depicted as a brilliant, well-educated man in the arts and sciences, known for his [[wit]]ty sense of humor, and characteristically uses barbed witticisms with long words and intellectual references to distract his foes.<ref name="back29">{{cite journal|last=Boney|first=Alex |title=The Beauty of the Beast: Marvel's First Break-Out Mutant|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29 |pages=17-24|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> He is a world authority on [[biochemistry]] and [[genetics]], the X-Men's [[physician|medical doctor]], and the [[science]] and [[mathematics]] instructor at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] (the X-Men's headquarters and school for young mutants). He is also a mutant [[political activist]], campaigning against society's [[bigotry]] and [[discrimination]] against mutants. While fighting his own bestial instincts and fears of social rejection, Beast dedicates his physical and mental gifts to the creation of a better world for man and mutant. He does not turn into the Beast when he takes off his glasses.

One of the original X-Men, Beast has appeared regularly in X-Men-related comics since his debut. He has also been a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].

The character has also appeared in media adaptations, including animated TV series and feature films. In ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', [[Steve Bacic]] portrayed him in a very brief cameo in his human appearance while in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' he was played by [[Kelsey Grammer]]. [[Nicholas Hoult]] portrays a younger version of the character in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''. Both Hoult and Grammer reprise their roles in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]''. Hoult also reprised the role in ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''. He had a cameo in ''[[Deadpool 2]]''.

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1963 in comics#September|September 1963]]). Stan Lee writes in the [[foreword]] to ''X-Men: The Ultimate Guide'' that he made Beast the most articulate, eloquent, and well-read of the X-Men to contrast with his brutish exterior. Further, the book opines that the [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]]-[[Roy Thomas]] team garnered admiration for their "appealing and sensitive characterizations of the original X-Men". Roth, under the alias Jay Gavin, had taken over for Kirby fully by issue #18, and Thomas was a new talent. Beast was given an individualized, colorful new costume, along with the rest of the X-Men by issue #39 in order to attract new readers. During [[Jim Steranko]]'s tenure, which added "exciting art", Roth returned, working with [[Neal Adams]] who blended Kirby's style with "realism, idealized beauty, and epic grandeur".

In ''Amazing Adventures'' #11 (March 1972), written by [[Gerry Conway]], Beast underwent a radical change and mutated into his now familiar furry, blue appearance. The concept originated with Roy Thomas, an effort to make the character more visibly striking, and Beast also became more werewolf-like to capitalize on the success of ''[[Werewolf by Night]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Steve Englehart]], who wrote the remainder of the Beast's short-lived spotlight in ''Amazing Adventures'', emphasized the character's wit rather than the tragedy of his transformation into a more monstrous form, reasoning that the Beast's intelligence and sense of humor would allow him to see his misfortune in perspective.<ref name="back29"/> Over the next decade the Beast would appear on the roster of several teams in titles ranging from ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' to ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' to ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]''. It wasn't until 1991, in ''X-Factor'' #70/''X-Men'' #1, that the Beast finally returned to the X-Men.

Englehart later said that he added the Beast to the Avengers roster because he wanted to write the character again and thought his funny, down-to-earth personality would make him a good foil for [[Moondragon]].<ref name="back29"/> Succeeding writers of ''The Avengers'' similarly found that the character's lightheartedness made a good balance to the team's generally serious tone, resulting in the Beast's run in ''The Avengers'' outlasting his earlier run in ''X-Men''.<ref name="back29"/> His friendship with fellow Avenger [[Wonder Man]] would likewise come to eclipse his friendship with X-Man [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]] for the comics fandom.<ref name="back29"/> ''The Avengers'' #137 (July 1975) debuted the Beast's [[catchphrase]], "Oh, my stars and garters,"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boney|first=Alex |title=Stars and Garters: A Collection of Beast's Best|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29 |page=23|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> and ''The Avengers'' #164 (October 1977) was the first to depict him as a [[sex symbol]], a take which writer [[Jim Shooter]] said resulted in very positive mail from female readers in particular.<ref name="back29"/>

Beast cured the [[Legacy Virus]] in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #390 (2001), and in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #3 (2001) he experienced a further mutation into a [[felidae|feline]] being, first shown in the introduction to ''[[New X-Men]]'' (June, 2001), by [[Frank Quitely]] and [[Grant Morrison]]. As evidenced on the back cover of ''X-Treme X-Men'' Vol. 1, [[Chris Claremont]], writer of that series in addition to both ''Uncanny X-Men'' (for sixteen consecutive years) and ''X-Factor'', contributed much to the Beast's characterization. Citing Claremont as inspiration for his run on ''New X-Men'', Morrison explains Beast as a "brilliant, witty bipolar scientist". Morrison continues, "I saw Henry McCoy as an incredibly clever, witty, cultured, well-traveled, experienced, well-read character so I brought out those parts of his personality which seemed to me to fit the profiles of the smartest and most worldly people I know – his sense of humor is dark and oblique. He's obviously quite clearly bipolar and swings between manic excitement and ghastly self-doubt. He has no dark secrets, however, and nothing to hide."<ref>''[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2707 The End of an X-Era]''</ref>

[[Joss Whedon]]'s "[[Gifted (comics)|Astonishing X-Men: Gifted]]" story arc featured a "mutant cure" designed by Indian Benetech scientist [[Kavita Rao|Dr. Kavita Rao]], and the prospect of "real" humanity arouses the interest of a heavily mutated Beast, who visits Rao only to discover that the drug is the product of illegal human experimentation on an unknown victim. The idea of a mutant cure, which had previously appeared in the 1992 animated series, was also the basis of the ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' movie plot and the series was even made into a [[motion comic]]. IGN called the arc focusing on Beast "best X-Men run in a decade" and lauded Whedon for flawless character dynamics.<ref name="ign1">[http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/709/709053p1.html Astonishing X-Men HC, Vol. 1 Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611140149/http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/709/709053p1.html |date=2012-06-11 }}</ref> According to ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', Beast is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.<ref>{{cite web | last = Pisani | first = Joseph | authorlink = Joseph Pisani | title = The Smartest Superheroes | publisher = www.businessweek.com | year = 2006 | url = http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/05/smart_heroes/index_01.htm | accessdate = 2007-11-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071203062918/http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/05/smart_heroes/index_01.htm| archivedate= 3 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Beast appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010-2013 ''Secret Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).

==Fictional character biography==
===Main timeline Beast===
====Youth====
Henry Philip "Hank" McCoy was born in Dundee, [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]], to [[Norton McCoy|Norton]] and [[Edna McCoy]]. His father, Norton McCoy, is employed at a local nuclear power plant before Henry's birth and was once exposed to intense [[radioactive decay|nuclear radiation]], which appears to have caused his son's mutation. Hank is born with a vast intellect, unusually long arms and legs, and unusually large hands and feet - a rare although not unique case of mutant powers manifesting before puberty.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Letter Rip!|work=[[Marvel Age]]|issue=54|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=September 1987|page=30}}</ref> His bodily proportions are comparable to those of a gorilla, and later stories reveal his nickname in school was "[[Magilla Gorilla]]".

====With the X-Men====
[[File:Uncanny8.jpg|right|thumb|195px|Detail of cover to ''The X-Men'' #8 (Nov. 1964).<br/>Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
Henry's mutation more fully manifests during adolescence, providing greater strength and agility, and although his powers allow him to briefly excel in athletics during his remaining time at school, he soon attracts the animosity of his fellow students and other non-mutant humans. As he seeks refuge, he is approached by [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], who invites him to study at [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

Henry recognizes the opportunities such an institution can offer him and accepts the invitation. He finds the school both a fountain of scientific knowledge and a place of sanctuary. There he is introduced to the X-Men, who accept him into their ranks and give him the codename Beast. Alongside workouts in the [[Danger Room]], under Xavier's tutelage, he studies subjects ranging from [[differential equation]]s to [[Marcel Proust|Proust]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

With the rest of the X-Men on their first field mission, he battles [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] for the first time,<ref>[[Lee, Stan]] (w), [[Kirby, Jack]] (p), [[Reinman, Paul]] (i). "X-Men", ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 (September 1963).

"The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants", ''X-Men'' #4 (March 1964). Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref> He became stressed because he had to keep a secret identity while in the X-Men team, so he briefly left the team to become a professional wrestler. While he was a professional wrestler he met [[Unus the Untouchable]], and helped the X-Men build a [[directed energy weapon]] to make Unus completely untouchable, resulting in Unus not being able to feed himself.<ref name="XM8">Lee, Stan (w), Kirby, Jack (p), Stone, Charles (i). "The Uncanny Threat of... Unus, the Untouchable!", ''X-Men'' #8 (November 1964). Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref> Beast then rejoined the X-Men team.

''X-Men'' #50-53 (November 1968 - February 1969). Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref>

====Furry change and team trading====
Hank leaves the X-Men shortly after his twentieth birthday, after remarking that he is no longer one of the "strangest teens of all". He becomes a research scientist at the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]], a genetics research facility. His assistant, Linda Donaldson, quickly becomes his girlfriend. Hank isolates a "hormonal extract" allowing anyone to become a mutant for a short period of time, and uses the mutagenic serum on himself to disguise his appearance while foiling an attempt to steal his research.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' vol. 2 #11</ref> He waits too long to reverse the process, leaving him permanently transformed. He grows grey fur, which later turns blue, all over his body and acquires pointed ears, elongated canine teeth, claws, the ability to run on walls and ceilings like a spider, enhanced senses, an accelerated healing factor, and a feral side he struggles to control. He briefly joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants when [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] wipes out his memory, but quickly recovers. When Beast is wounded, he is aided by [[Patsy Walker]], and then reunited with his old girlfriend, Vera Cantor.<ref name="amazing" /> Back at Brand Laboratories, he discovers his girlfriend Linda Donaldson is an agent of the criminal [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]], and they break up.<ref>''Marvel Adventures'' vol. 2, #12. Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref>

[[File:Beast Jim Lee art.jpg|left|thumb|Beast on the cover of ''X-Men'' vol. 2, #1 (1991); art by [[Jim Lee]]]]
Not long after this transformation, Beast is recruited to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as a provisional member.<ref>''Avengers'' #137</ref> He is later granted full Avengers membership<ref>''Avengers'' #151</ref> and remains a member for many years, becoming a close friend of [[Wonder Man]]. He leaves the team periodically to rejoin the X-Men during times of need (such as "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]"<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w), [[Byrne, John]] (p), [[Austin, Terry]] (i). ''Uncanny X-Men'' #134-137 (June 1980 - September 1980). Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref>). Beast returns to the Avengers each time, but eventually leaves so that the team, which has a six-member limit at the time, can be filled out by new recruits.<ref name="avengers211">[[Shooter, Jim]] (w), [[Colan, Gene]] (p), [[Dan Green (artist)|Green, Dan]] (i). "... By Force of Mind", ''The Avengers'' #211 (September 1981). Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref>

He later joins the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]],<ref>''Defenders'' #104. Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref> stays with the team to organize as the "new" Defenders,<ref>''Defenders'' #125. Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref> and is one of the final surviving members at the time of its first disbandment as a result of the battle with [[Moondragon]] and the [[Dragon of the Moon]].<ref>''Defenders'' #152. Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref> Beast and fellow surviving Defenders [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and Iceman are contacted shortly after by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]] to form a new group, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #1. Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref>

====X-Factor====
With X-Factor, Beast rejoins the original members of the X-Men, and is again reunited with Vera Cantor. Beast starts out in his furred form, but on their second mission, he is captured by [[Tower (comics)|Tower]]. He is delivered to Carl Maddicks and used in an attempt to develop a cure for mutancy, which has rendered Maddicks' son, [[Artie Maddicks|Artie]], mute. Maddicks develops a serum based on McCoy's original serum, and tests it on Beast. Hank is also subjected to chemotherapy and radiation, and suffers a cardiac arrest. X-Factor arrives on the scene and saves Hank, but not before he's been injected with the serum. When the bandages around his face are removed, he is revealed to have lost his blue fur.<ref>''X-Factor'' #1-3</ref> This helps in X-Factor's cover as normal humans who are mutant hunters for hire (though they actually help the mutants they capture). When they see the need for their powers, they get new costumes similar to their old X-Men costumes, and call themselves the X-Terminators, posing as renegade mutants. Beast wears a mask as he did originally, since he now looks human again.

Eventually X-Factor clashes with the ancient mutant [[Apocalypse (Marvel Comics)|Apocalypse]]<ref>''X-Factor'' #6</ref> after Angel loses his wings in a battle and shortly after goes missing. Apocalypse turns Angel into Death, the most powerful of his four [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]]. During the battle, Beast is touched by the Horseman [[Plague (comics)|Pestilence]], whose touch usually causes incredible pain and viral infection. The infection interacts with the recent serum treatment of Maddicks, and instead of killing him, Hank is affected in such a way that every time he uses his superhuman strength, his intelligence decreases.<ref>''X-Factor'' #24</ref> Though the battle is won, it comes at the cost of Hank's decreasing intelligence and Angel's humanity, which would not return for a time. Hank’s condition worsens for weeks. He even openly talks to [[Trish Tilby]], a reporter, not realizing she might use the information on TV. Out of respect for Hank's situation, Trish does not mention his name when she reports about X-Factor’s recent battles, only that one of them lost his intellect while heroically defending New York. Beast is still hurt by her using the information at all, but she is able to convince him that she meant well.

X-Factor finally ends their charade and are hailed as heroes, and they then don costumes similar to their previous X-Terminator costumes. When Hank’s mind is nothing more than that of a child, he intercepts a mutant called [[Infectia]] who is trying to kiss Iceman. Infectia has the ability to manipulate molecular structures through touch, creating mutated "monsters". When she kisses Beast, he becomes feverish and begins switching back and forth between his normal and furred forms.<ref name="auto">''X-Factor'' #31</ref> Finally, he stabilizes in his furry appearance, keeps his intelligence, and has more strength than ever.<ref>''X-Factor'' #33</ref>

====Return to X-Men====
Hank soon resumes wearing his old costume, but now no longer has need for a mask. During the events of ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'', Beast, along with the rest of X-Factor team up with the X-Men and various other heroes to fight the evil forces invading the city; eventually, they manage to stop a portal between [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] and Earth from remaining open and peace returns for the survivors.<ref>''X-Factor'' #39</ref> Soon after ''Inferno'' ends, the ''[[X-Tinction Agenda]]'' takes place where Genosha wants to punish various mutants for war crimes on their island. Here, Beast plays yet another key role. Shortly after the crisis ends, X-Factor switches costumes once more; Cyclops, Jean, and Iceman all wear identical costumes, while Beast returns to wearing trunks, and [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] sticks to his old costume he received from Apocalypse.<ref>''X-Factor'' #63</ref>

Towards the end of X-Factor's career, they battle the [[Shadow King]] during the ''[[Muir Island Saga]]''. The final battle leaves Professor Xavier crippled again, which results in X-Factor rejoining the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281, ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #1</ref>

====Studying the Legacy Virus====
One of Beast's greatest challenges emerges with [[Stryfe]]'s fatal [[Legacy Virus]]. Hank is already despondent, as he is turning thirty and questions his life accomplishments. His frustrations are further compounded when Professor Xavier and [[Moira MacTaggert]] don't ask for his assistance with the Legacy research, but it turns out Xavier is just giving him his privacy. Perusing their data, Hank learns the problem is more difficult than he had initially imagined. Hank has always believed that, given time, he could solve any problem; the Legacy Virus becomes his obsession. He goes as far as making an unethical decision in giving [[Mister Sinister]] information on the virus, since he has more resources and fewer morals to inhibit him.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

A turning point comes when [[Dark Beast]] finishes some of the formula, occasionally prying more information from Hank whom he imprisoned and replaces for a while.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol 2 #49</ref> The most critical step toward a solution (other than when Beast individually finds the cure without acknowledgement) comes when Dr. MacTaggert discovers [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s irresponsible manipulation of virus strains. The cure is incomplete and it takes Beast to design the final cure. Based on Moira's notes, Beast concocts the anti-virus to much elation, but it soon is repaid with a heavy toll—[[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] chooses to sacrifice his life to release the remedy.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #390</ref>

After mourning the loss of a teammate, Hank briefly leaves the school with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and her [[X-Treme X-Men]] team in search of [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s diaries. After an attack by [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] that leaves [[Psylocke]] dead, Beast is gravely injured and returns to the Institute.

====Enhanced feline form====
As the world experiences a mutant [[baby boom]], much of the mutant community seemingly begins experiencing "[[secondary mutation]]s", often taking the form of additional or enhanced abilities. In the aftermath of Vargas' attack, Beast's secondary mutation is "jumpstarted" due to the powers of teammate [[Sage (comics)|Sage]]. The further mutation causes Beast to develop a more feline physique, to which he initially has some trouble adapting. A psychic attack by the genocidal [[Cassandra Nova]] leaves Beast humiliated, badly beaten (by the controlled body of his friend [[Barnell Bohusk|Beak]]) and haunted by the possibility that his new form is simply a step in a continuous state of [[devolution (biological fallacy)|devolution]]. Additionally, the alteration in form causes his long-time girlfriend, [[Trish Tilby]], to break up with him after being accused of [[zoophilia|bestiality]] in the media. Over time, Beast strikes up a strong friendship with [[Emma Frost]], in one incident bringing her flowers to cheer her up. He finds her diamond form shattered into thousands of pieces and spends some time putting her back together. With a final jolt of psionic energy from Jean Grey, Frost returns to life.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}

Beast later uncovers what seems to be a female mutant with feline features, like his situation. This raises hopes for him, until he discovers it's not a mutant human that looks like a cat, it's a mutant cat who looks like a human. Either way, the creature is at the limit of her life and Beast allows her to leave the X-Mansion to pass away quietly in a spot she finds comfortable.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}

====Astonishing X-Men====
[[File:Beastastonishing.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Cover art of ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' vol. 3, #1 (July 2004), depicting Beast's feline form; art by [[John Cassaday]]]]
When news of a "cure" that would reverse mutations suddenly arises, Beast finds himself seriously considering taking it so he can once again appear human. Hank eventually decides against it after vigorous "urging" by fellow team member [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], as it would send out a negative message to other mutants if an X-Man were to take the cure. After learning that the cure was developed by fellow geneticist [[Kavita Rao]] through experimentation on mutant corpses – as well as on the X-Man Colossus – Beast helps take down Rao's operation. When the villainous [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] attacks the X-Men, Cassandra Nova telepathically strips away Beast's higher human consciousness, leaving him with only his animal instincts. After hunting Wolverine around campus (and even eating his leg), a student named [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]] faces him down with a device he and Xavier had built in case his consciousness was ever lost. The device is a high-powered sensory stimulant in the form of a ball of string, which Beast had alluded to as being his greatest fear. Once restored, he is quick to put on a suit and tie and help Wolverine with a hyper-magnetic device. He, along with his teammates, are taken from the Mansion by the government agency [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] and airlifted to the alien Breakworld.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}

====Civil War====
When a [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] breaks out among Marvel's superheroes, Beast, along with the other X-Men, assumes a neutral stance. Beast was not a particular fan of the policy and secretly violates his stance by providing [[Spider-Man]] with a holographic disguise to enable him to continue teaching at Midtown High after his secret identity has been exposed.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #14</ref> Despite his personal feelings about the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], Beast enlists his services to the Initiative program after the war's end, to assist in the training of the next generation of superheroes.<ref name="CivilWar:BDR">{{Comic book reference | Writer = Ronald Byrd, [[Anthony Flamini]] | Penciller = Various | Inker = Various | Story = The Initiative | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 |date= 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

====Decimation====
The X-Men and various other mutants attend the funeral of a young mutant boy named Matt Landru who has been killed in a road traffic accident and muse on what this means for mutant-kind. Beast plans to find a way to reverse [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. Despite the 'aid' of his other self (the [[Dark Beast]]), along with exploring such diverse avenues of investigation as analysis of alternate timelines or an attempt to track down the [[Scarlet Witch]], he is unsuccessful in his research, but the final part shows him holding a child wearing a three-eyed smiley face shirt saying "Evolution" on it as a promotion of the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]''.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

====Messiah CompleX====
Beast is shown helping Professor X repair Cerebro when the X-Men are tracking down the child with the X-Gene.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #492 (2008)</ref> Beast is later seen at the Mansion when it is attacked by the Sentinels, who have been taken over by an unknown person.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #205 (2008)</ref> When Iceman arrives at the school with the New X-Men, Beast works with [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|Prodigy]] and is able to stabilize the mortally wounded [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]], as well as the other New X-Men and X-Men injured in their battles with the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] and the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], respectively.<ref>''New X-Men'' Vol. 2 #45 (2008)</ref> He is later present during the battle on Muir Island and is among the first to reach Professor Xavier after he is accidentally shot by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. Xavier's body soon disappears.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #207 (2008)</ref>

In the aftermath, Cyclops has sent Beast to search for Professor Xavier, whose status is unknown by the X-Men. Beast is also seen closing down the ruins of the X-Mansion and taking [[Martha Johansson]] with him.<ref>''X-Men Divided We Stand'' #2</ref>

====Move to San Francisco====
Beast is seen as part of the team setting up a new X-Men headquarters in San Francisco, California. He is working closely with Cyclops, Emma Frost, and the rookie X-Man, [[Armor (comics)|Armor]]. He is also still seeing [[Abigail Brand]], who requests that he take a weekend off from the X-Men so that she can 'tamper with him extensively'.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} He helps [[Tabitha Smith]], teaching the young and flippant woman to use research instead of brutal strength to fight her enemy, a mutant with sedation powers called [[Nuwa (comics)|Nuwa]].<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #1</ref> He and Warren go to Buenos Aires to recruit [[Doctor Nemesis]] to help the X-Men save the Mutant race. Only after they stop tube-grown super Nazis, does Nemesis agree.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' 505</ref> They also recruit [[Madison Jeffries]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' 506</ref> Together, they created a time travel device so that they could travel into the future and retrieve the mutant Messiah. However, because they created a device for time travel in so little time, the side-effect of the device is that the user's biology breaks down upon entering the future, so it will automatically bring the person back in thirty-two and a half hours.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' 507</ref>

Beast discovers that the [[Super-Skrull]]s with X-Men abilities can be infected with the Legacy Virus.<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #3</ref> Despite his ethical protests to the contrary, Cyclops decides to use it on them, offering the antidote in return for the Skrulls' retreat.<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #4</ref>

====The X-Club====
In order to save mutantkind from the effects of M-Day, Beast and Angel had to gather a team of specialists to help them. They gathered [[Madison Jeffries]], Yuriko Takiguchi, and [[Doctor Nemesis|Dr. Nemesis]]. They then returned to Graymalkin Industries to meet their final member [[Kavita Rao|Dr. Kavita Rao]] (who was formerly trying to cure mutation). Beast and the X-Club traveled back to 1906 in order to find Dr. Nemesis' parents and discover the origins of modern mutation. During the mission, they also fought an early version of a Sentinel created by the Hellfire Club, and inadvertently caused the San Francisco earthquake. When they returned to the present, they found that their DNA evidence had been buried beneath where the Dreaming Celestial was standing in the park.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' 507-510</ref>

====Utopia====
After being captured, Beast became a test subject for the Omega Machine (designed by Dark Beast to eradicate mutant powers and place them in [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Weapon Omega]]) while being held prisoner on Alcatraz Island by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], along with Professor X.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia'' #1</ref> Beast is shown getting weaker and mentions losing his claws while hooked up to the machine. Beast was rescued by the X-Men, and later recuperated from his injuries. Later, he spoke at the funeral of Yuriko Takiguchi when Magneto had arrived.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #515</ref> Beast seemed increasingly disillusioned with Cyclops' leadership and methods, such as allowing Magneto to become a member to his time under torture under the Dark Beast.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #517</ref> This resulted in Beast leaving the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #519</ref>

====S.W.O.R.D.====
After leaving the X-Men, Beast opted to join his current girlfriend Agent Abigail Brand as a member of [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]]{{Issue|date=February 2012}} However, shortly after joining her in space, Brand's co-commander, [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] (hired by Norman Osborn) begins to round-up the aliens residing on Earth, in a xenophobic attempt at avoiding another Secret Invasion.{{Issue|date=February 2012}} As a result of Henry's plan, he has even made moves against Brand, resulting in her, Beast, and the dragon [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], becoming fugitives from S.W.O.R.D. and attempting to overthrow Gyrich.{{Issue|date=February 2012}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/101/1012437p1.html|title=Taking Control of S.W.O.R.D.|date=10 August 2009}}</ref>

====Second Coming====
Beast later returns in an issue of ''Uncanny X-Men'' to attend the funeral of his friend and teammate, Kurt Wagner ([[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]) where he confronts Scott Summers and blames Kurt's death on Scott's increasingly militant and extremist attitude to protecting the mutant species at all costs (even at the cost of sacrificing his friends to do so).<ref>''New Mutants'' #13</ref> Despite his issues with Cyclops, Beast remains on Utopia to help deal with the attacks being made by Bastion.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} Following Bastion's defeat at the hands of [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], Henry again departs Utopia.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}

====Accelerated Mutation and Time Travel====
[[File:AllNewX-Men10-beast.png|left|thumb|210px|Beast in ''[[All New X-Men]]'' #10 (June 2013), depicting the return to his simian form; art by Stuart Immonen]]
In the aftermath of the Phoenix War, Cyclops now actively strikes out at government organizations and holds mutants prisoner, with the X-Men unwilling to actively fight him as they fear the subsequent mutant civil war that might result. Beast, who is apparently dying due to side-effects of his secondary artificially-accelerated mutation, stumbles upon a solution after a chance comment from Iceman who says "the past Cyclops wouldn't tolerate his present self's actions". Beast travels back in time to the early days of the Xavier Institute to bring the original five X-Men from that period into the future, hoping that Scott's past self will be able to convince his present self to stand down.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Beast lapses into a coma shortly after bringing the team into the present,<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Jean's telepathy, which is artificially accelerated by the trauma of her trip to the future and witnessing what Scott has become,<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> manages to connect the minds of the two Hanks. This allows the younger Hank to spot a mistake in his future self's calculations and stabilize his physiology by reverting to a blue furred ape-like state again, though this time, his ape-form is bald and has no head hair aside from the blue fur covering his whole body.<ref name="ANXM #5">''All-New X-Men'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> The young X-Men decide to stay in the present and become the [[All-New X-Men]], except for Angel who joins Cyclops' Uncanny X-Men.{{issue|date=June 2016}}

====Death of X and working with Inhumans====
After Cyclops goes to Muir Island and discovers that all of the mutants died painful deaths, he calls Beast to do a diagnosis and Beast discovers that somehow that the Terrigen cloud, the substance that gives Inhumans their powers, has become toxic towards mutants after mixing with the atmosphere changed its structure.<ref>''Death of X'' #1</ref> Hoping to bridge Inhuman and Mutant relations in light of this new conflict, Beast works with the Inhumans to find a way to make the Terrigen cloud safe for mutants while making sure it remains suitable for Inhuman powers. He becomes a trusted ally to the Inhumans and joins their counsel.<ref>''Uncanny Inhumans'' #1-2</ref>

====Inhumans vs X-Men====
When the present Beast realizes that he cannot find a cure for the [[Terrigen]] cloud, he visits the rest of the mutants and advises them that the best course of action is for all mutants to leave Earth, but his teammates object and imprison him before he can warn the Inhumans that war is coming.<ref>''Inhumans vs X-Men'' #0</ref> However, after learning what the cloud will do to mutants, Medusa activates a generator to destroy the Terrigen cloud, leaving Emma to be branded a traitor for her false claims inform about Cyclops' true death to manipulate the X-Men into destroying the Inhumans. Havok helps Emma to escape for the sake of his brother's memory, while Beast and his remaining teammates make up, all regretting what their lives have come to ever since discovering that the Terrigen could kill them.<ref>''Inhumans VS X-Men'' #2-6</ref>

===Time-displaced Beast===
====All-New X-Men====
[[File:All_new_x-men_beast.jpg|thumb|left|The young time-displaced Beast. Art by [[Stuart Immonen]]]]
The younger Hank and All-New X-Men defects to [[X-Mansion#New Xavier School for the Gifted|Cyclops's school]],{{issue|date=February 2015}} after the events of the [[Battle of the Atom]] unfold.{{issue|date=June 2016}}. Young Hank is later transported to the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe,{{issue|date=February 2015}} where he is captured by that world's version of [[Alternative versions of Doctor Doom#Ultimate Marvel|Doctor Doom]].{{issue|date=February 2015}}, then teams up with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in finding the [[The Black Vortex|Black Vortex]].{{issue|date=June 2016}}

The time-displaced Jean Grey accidentally reads the mind of the present Beast and finds out that he regrets never telling her his true feeling.{{issue|date=June 2016}} Jean then confronts the time-displaced Hank and gives him a kiss.{{issue|date=June 2016}} They don't have time to develop their relationship since Dr. Octopus attacks them in New York City,{{issue|date=June 2016}}

====Introduction to magic====
Following the reconstruction of reality after the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Battleworld crisis]], the displaced X-Men remain in the future, travelling the world as they try to find their place, while the 'present' Beast works with the Inhumans to find a means of resolving the recent release of Terrigenesis crystals that have proven dangerous to mutants.{{issue|date=April 2016}} Increasingly frustrated with his inability to find a way back to their time through science, the young Beast contacts [[Doctor Strange]] for advice on using magic, but although Strange cannot help due to his currently weakened powers, when Hank is able to help him find a solution to a dimensional rift he was investigating, Strange reassures Hank that he is smart enough to find a solution to the current dilemma.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' vol.2 #8</ref> After the conflict with the Inhumans is concluded, the younger Beast reveals to his teammates that he has determined, through a combination of science and magic, that the younger X-Men cannot return to the past as they are already there, leaving them free to travel the world and find their own place.<ref name="All-New 2 19">''All New X-Men'' Vol. 2 #19</ref><ref>''X-Men Prime'' #1</ref>

====RessurXion====
The young Beast finds himself working alongside Magneto along with the rest of the time-displaced X-Men doing whatever it takes to preserve Xavier's dream. Beast begins to use magic more freely on their missions, something that greatly distresses Cyclops. Whenever they're at [[Madripoor#X-Men HQ|X-Men HQ]] Beast spends most of his time on his own to continue study magic and becomes increasingly reclusive in the process.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #1-2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
It is possible that Beast's mutation is a result of genetic [[atavism]].<ref name="Yaco, Linc, Haber, Karen 2004">{{cite book | authors = Yaco, Linc, Haber, Karen |date=February 2004| title = The Science of the X-Men | publisher = I Books/Marvel | isbn = 0-7434-8725-7}}</ref> However, he also possesses [[neoteny|neotenous]] characteristics, which may explain him having a genius-level intellect despite his animal physique.<ref name="Yaco, Linc, Haber, Karen 2004" /> He also possesses superhuman strength, speed and agility. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, employing a unique style of acrobatic combat, from combat training he received at Professor Xavier's and coaching from [[Captain America]].

===Anthropoid/Simian physique===
Originally, Hank McCoy retains the basic features of a normal human alongside a generally [[simian]] physiology (e.g., elongated limbs and enlarged extremities) equivalent to that of a [[hominidae|Great Ape]]. This mutation gives him superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, agility, flexibility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance. Hank is equally dexterous with all four limbs; able to perform tasks with his feet or hands with equal ease. Because of his talents and training, Beast can outperform any [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-level athlete, contorting his body and performing aerial feats gracefully. His strength and dexterity allow him to climb vertical surfaces with just his hands and/or feet,<ref>''X-Men'' #2, 8, 48, 50, 51, 52</ref> jump great distances<ref name="XM8" /> and survive falls that would kill any ordinary person.<ref>''X-Men'' #48</ref> He also possesses enhanced senses and can track people for great distances over open terrain<ref name="XM10" /> and his feet are sensitive enough to detect electronic signals (from bombs, listening devices, etc.) through solid walls and floors.<ref>''X-Men'' #11, 38</ref> Later, he drank an experimental solution of his own making and mutated further through the growth of grey fur covering his entire body and the enhancement of all of his existing abilities, especially his strength, and Hank also gained a nearly instantaneous healing factor.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #11-14</ref> The psychological impact of this first transformation caused Beast to experience short-term amnesia and also made it difficult for him to control his animalistic instincts, which would cause him to slip into an uncontrollable berserker rage during combat.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #11-13</ref> However, his body suddenly mutated again after a short time, changing his fur color from grey to black (although comic book printing technology depicted it as blue), returning his strength to previous levels, and losing his healing factor.<ref name="amazing">''Amazing Adventures'' #15</ref> He was also able to more easily control his animal instincts after this second mutation. Beast gained the ability to emit mood altering [[pheromone]]s, causing sexual attraction in women.<!-- I think this was in one of the issues of S.W.O.R.D.-->{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Hank McCoy briefly returned to his human form<ref>''X-Factor'' #3 (1986)</ref> with his hair color now being depicted as black, not reddish brown. During this time he was occasionally depicted with claws and fangs, but these were not a part of his original mutation.<ref name="amazing" /> However, as a result of being touched by [[Plague (comics)|Pestilence]] his strength began to increase exponentially while his intellect began to decrease.<ref>''X-Factor'' #19 (1986)</ref>

After [[Infectia]]'s kiss restored Hank to his simian physique, his intellect had stabilized and returned to his previous genius-level, and his strength had increased to superhuman proportions.<ref name="auto"/> Beast's fangs and claws became a consistent part of his appearance after this return to his "blue and furry" form.

===Feline physique===
After being critically wounded,<ref>''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #2-#4</ref> Hank's body undergoes a [[secondary mutation]], jump started by [[Sage (comics)|Sage]]. The result is a more [[felidae|feline]] appearance equivalent to that of a [[big cat]]. His strength, speed, stamina, sturdiness, and senses increase further with this change. He gains cat-like agility, flexibility, coordination, and balance, and all his senses are enhanced to twenty times that of a normal human being. In addition, Beast develops an accelerated healing factor that allows him to repair mild to moderate injuries within the span of a few hours. However, as his hands and feet change from simian to feline (going from a normal human set of four fingers to just three, retaining the opposable thumb), he loses his superhuman dexterity, once admitting that he used to play the guitar, but is now learning to play the drums instead. Following the X-Men's relocation to San Francisco, Beast discovers that he had regained some of his old manual dexterity. In the first issue of Warren Ellis' ''Astonishing X-Men'' run, Beast also comments he no longer needs full sleep.{{issue|date=November 2013}}

It is later discovered that his secondary feline mutation is still detrimental to his health: as such, with the combined efforts of past versions of Jean Grey and himself, Beast's condition was stabilized in a more human-like form, possessing blue fur and larger than the average human male but otherwise fairly human.<ref name="ANXM #5" />

===Genius-level intellect===
Hank possesses a brilliant intellect. He is a world-renowned [[biochemistry|biochemist]], having earned [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]s in [[Biophysics]] and [[Genetics]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #308</ref> and is the man who cured the [[Legacy Virus]]. He frequently functions as both field medic and in-house physician for the X-Men, despite not technically having an MD. His intelligence and expertise in [[genetics]] rival that of [[Professor X]], [[Moira McTaggert]], and [[Kavita Rao]]. Despite this, he has never received a [[Nobel Prize]] or been elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]. A [[polymath|Renaissance man]], McCoy is well-versed in many fields including languages (fluent in English, [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] as well as the fictional language Latverian<ref name="avengers211" />), [[literature]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]], [[history]], [[art]] and [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], and [[music]], as well as in [[political science]] and [[economics]] with a special affinity for science and technology and a penchant for quoting literary classics. His vast scientific knowledge ranges from [[theoretical physics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[differential equation]]s, [[nanotechnology]], [[anatomy]], [[biomedicine]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[mechanical engineering]] to the construction of a hyper-magnetic device. An electronics expert, he often repairs [[Cerebro]] and makes upgrades to the Danger Room settings. He has made several deus ex machina devices on par with Reed Richards, including a device that strips entities of cosmic powers. While not a medical doctor, he was able to perform brain surgery on the [[Red Skull]] to extract the fragment of Charles Xavier's brain that the Skull had grafted onto himself, removing the Skull's telepathic abilities while leaving the villain otherwise apparently healthy.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 3 #22</ref>

===Time-displaced Beast===
After a meeting with Doctor Strange, the displaced younger Beast has mastered a combination of science and magic, allowing him to return himself and his four teammates to the past for a few minutes, although he notes that it took a great deal of effort to send them back for that long and it merely confirmed that history has been 'reset' so that the displaced X-Men are no longer 'needed' in the past.<ref name="All-New 2 19" /> He has also mastered a mystical portal that allowed him to send the Juggernaut to Siberia after passing through Hell.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #1</ref>

==Similarities==
According to writer [[Will Murray]], a possible inspiration for the Beast was [[List of Doc Savage characters|Andrew Blodgett "Monk" Mayfair]], a companion of pulp hero [[Doc Savage]]. Both are possessed of an apelike appearance and are brilliant scientists. Before becoming more erudite in later issues, McCoy also used a great deal of slang in his early appearances much like Monk.<ref>Murray, Will (April 2004). "Pulp Roots of the X-Men".
