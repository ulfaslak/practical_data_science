'''Elloe Kaifi''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
She first appeared in ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #92 in the 2006 Hulk storyline [[Planet Hulk]] and was created by [[Greg Pak]] and [[Carlo Pagulayan]].

==Fictional character biography==
Prior to the events of ''Planet Hulk'', Elloe Kaifi was the daughter of Ronan Kaifi, a member of a high-ranking family on the planet Sakaar. Enjoying a relatively carefree life for most of her early years, Elloe's life changed when her father spoke out against the [[Red King (Marvel Comics)|Red King]], resulting in his titles being stripped from him and he, his daughter and her bodyguard [[Lavin Skee]] being sent to the gladiator training school, the Maw. When her father protested at his treatment, he was killed by the guards shortly before the training battle began, of which Elloe and Lavin were two of the seven survivors. Initially lacking combat skills, Elloe received training from Skee before she left the group to try to aid rebels in an attack on the emperor.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

After she and her fellow rebels were captured and brought before her former comrades in the arena, shortly after their third victory in the arena over the '[[Silver Surfer|Silver Savage]]', the gladiators were ordered to kill Elloe and the others to earn their freedom. [[Hiroim|Hiroim the Shamed]] revealed that Lavin Skee had been killed in battle earlier, and that the others had formed a Warbound Pact; thus, since Skee had served Elloe, the Warbound could not kill her without violating their oath. Although their obedience discs were activated, the Warbound were freed when the Surfer destroyed the discs, allowing them to escape and begin a rebellion against the Red King.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Although physically the weakest member of the Warbound — particularly after [[Miek]]'s evolution — Elloe remained one of the members most dedicated to the death of the Red King. However, she retained her old family loyalties; after the Red King was killed in a fight with the Hulk and her mother was discovered to be one of the King's remaining supporters, Elloe fought against fellow Warbound Miek in the arena before the Hulk told both of them to cease.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

===Traveling to Earth===
Following the destruction of Sakaar, Elloe travelled to Earth with the remaining members of the Warbound to seek revenge on the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] who exiled Hulk (using a special armor to make her the physical equal of her teammates). During the fight with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Elloe takes down [[Spider-Man]]. Later she is shown working alongside Hiroim to capture [[Doctor Strange]], where she defeated [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]] and [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]], who were soon electrocuted by the others soldiers while Hiroim easily bested [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. After this fast fight, Hiroim says to Elloe to take the trio to the arena while he attacks Doctor Strange, although he was defeated by the Sorcerer Supreme before he went on to confront the Hulk.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

At the arena, Elloe is almost slain by the infiltrating hero [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]]. She is saved when Cloud 9's companions talk her out of completing her actions.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5 (2007)</ref>

In World War Hulk's "Aftersmash" one-shot followup, Elloe is heavily wounded, impaled on a spear to end hostilities between Sakaarians and Hivelings, who had been killing each other over Miek's complicity in the destruction of Sakaar. It is also revealed that though she was not part of Miek's betrayal, she had harbored a shameful secret in that part of her was glad when Crown City was destroyed, because it gave her an excuse to give in to her anger and hatred.

She is shown alive, but gravely injured with the remaining Warbound when they are transported to Gammaworld, a massive energy dome placed over the Southwestern United States by [[Leader (comics)|The Leader]]. Elloe's injuries were then healed by [[Kate Waynesboro]] administering medical nanites, her own alien physiology, and the gamma radiation.<ref>Planet Skaar (collects Skaar: Son of Hulk #7-12 and Planet Skaar Prologue, 192 pages, hardcover, September 2009, {{ISBN|0-7851-3986-9}}, softcover, June 2010, {{ISBN|0-7851-2821-2}})</ref>
