==Fictional character biography==
The Mangaverse [[Spider-Man]] first appeared in the first series (created, written and drawn by [[Kaare Andrews]]) where his origin was very different from the regular Marvel Spider-Man.  In the Mangaverse Peter Parker is the last member of the Spider Clan of [[ninja]]s and has been taught martial arts by his [[sensei]], [[Uncle Ben]]. After Ben's murder by [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], an underling of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], Peter starts to train in secret so he will be strong enough to exact his revenge. In this version of Spider-Man, [[May Parker|Aunt May]] is Peter's mother's sister instead of Uncle Ben being his father's brother. The Mangaverse Spider-Man was brought back for his own mini-series (again written by original creator Kaare Andrews) in which he encounters a cybernetic version of the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], as well as the Venom symbiote. This symbiote does not become Venom and has mystical origins and connections to an 'evil' clan of Ninja who are affiliated with Spiders, apparently a counterpart to Spider-Man's own ninja clan. [[Norman Osborn]], better known as the [[Green Goblin]], has a minor appearance in the series.

In ''New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate'', references are made to both the death of Captain America and in the ''Spider-Man: Legend of the Spider Clan'' miniseries which introduced his black costume and the Mangaverse Black Cat. During the course of this series, Spider-Man develops the unexpected ability to shoot webbing, which surprises him entirely. He is also the object of affection for both the Black Cat (though she later turns out to have been in league with the Mangaverse [[Nick Fury]], her true loyalty unknown), and Mary Jane Watson, who becomes the Mangaverse version of Spider-Woman, and is shown to be being trained by Peter in the ways of the Spider-Clan.

Unlike in the mainline Marvel Universe where Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, and Felicia Hardy are now adults, all three of them are in their early to mid-teens at this point, and possibly their mid-to-late teens by the time of New Mangaverse. This version of Spidey has wrapped gloves, a backpack emblazoned with the spider symbol, and tennis shoes.

===Spider-Verse===
The Mangaverse incarnation later appears in the crossover comic book storyline entitled [[Spider-Verse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/marvel-debuts-spider-verse-event-featuring-every-incarnation-of-spider-man/|title=Marvel Debuts SPIDER-VERSE Event Featuring Every Incarnation of Spider-Man|work=Nerdist}}</ref><ref name="Lowes">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=51683|title=Dan Slott Unveils "Spider-Verse," Featuring "Every Spider-Man Ever" - Comic Book Resources|work=comicbookresources.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=57237|title=SPIDER-MANDATE: The Debut of "Spider-Woman," Importance of Tie-Ins - Comic Book Resources|work=comicbookresources.com}}</ref> He was one of the starred characters in the [[anthology]] comic book ''Spider-Verse'' #1 starring in the story "Spider Clan: The Many" continuing the Marvel Mangaverse series that starred him before. The story is written by [[Skottie Young]] and [[Jake Andrews]].  Jesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] explained that despite that "fans of the Mangaverse Spider-Man will be pleased to see that Peter Parker return", he expressed  Kaare Andrews not returning as unfortunate and also expressing disappointment with the new writers. He felt that Young "goes through a lot of effort in sending Peter on a journey to confront his heritage, only for it not to matter much in the end." He also compared it as ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''-lite than being truly manga-inspired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/13/spider-verse-1-review|title=Spider-Verse #1 Review|work=IGN}}</ref> Meanwhile comic book writer [[Nick Lowe]] complimented their work calling it "great".<ref name="Lowes"/>

Mangaverse Spider-Man also appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (vol. 3) #12  teaming up with The Manga's Spider-Man and  SP//dr. Jesse Schedeen praised that scene, describing as one of the highlights of the comics book issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/07/amazing-spider-man-12-review|title=Amazing Spider-Man #12 Review|work=IGN}}</ref>

==Reception==
 [[File:SpiderManShatteredDimensionsConceptArt.png|thumb|right|170px|Concept art of the Marvel Mangaverse Spider-Man suit in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]''.]]
Shane Denson of ''Transnational Perspectives on Graphic Narratives: Comics at the Crossroads'' was negative on the mini-series starring the comic book character feeling that it did not offer enough transnational and transcultural themes unlike the other manga series starring Spider-Man. He also compared it to ''[[Star Wars]]'' with Uncle Ben being much like [[Yoda]], Spider-Man being like [[Luke Skywalker]] and Venom being like [[Darth Vader]] with him being revealed as Spider-Man's cousin.<ref name="Transnational"/>
