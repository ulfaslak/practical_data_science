'''Iceman''' ('''Robert Louis "Bobby" Drake''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]] and is a founding member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in [[Uncanny X-Men|''The X-Men'']] #1 (September 1963).

Iceman is a member of a subspecies of humans known as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s, who are born with superhuman abilities. He has the ability to manipulate ice and cold by freezing [[water vapor]] around him. This allows him to freeze objects, as well as turn his body into [[ice]].

The character has been frequently present in X-Men and [[Spider-Man]]-related [[American comic book|comics]], video games, animated series, and movies. [[Shawn Ashmore]] portrayed Iceman in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]], and voices the character in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]''.

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1963 in comics#September|September 1963]]). Lee later admitted that Iceman was created essentially as a copy of the [[Human Torch]], only using the opposite element for his power.<ref>{{cite news | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = Patrick Daniel | last2 = Lee | first2 = Stan | authorlink2 = Stan Lee | date = August 1993 | title = X Marks the Spot | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 8–9 | quote = Then I wanted a character sort of like the Torch. What's opposite of fire? Ice. Water might have been the opposite, but I couldn't think of anything to do visually with water. I felt a little guilty because Iceman was such a copy of the Human Torch in an opposite way.}}</ref>

Iceman was featured in two self-titled limited comic book miniseries, one in 1984-85 written by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and another in the 2000s by Andy Lanning and Dan Abnett, with art by [[Karl Kerschl]]. DeMatteis said of the first series, "It was my idea, so there was no one to blame but myself. I'll just say that it was a mistake and if the series made any sense whatsoever it was due to [editor] [[Bob Budiansky]]. That was a case where the editor's input was really needed - and Bob was a big help."<ref>{{cite news | first1 = Jim | last1 = Salicrup | first2 = Mike | last2 = Higgins | authorlink1 = Jim Salicrup | date = October 1986 | title = J.

A mainstay in most X-Men titles, Iceman has been a main character in both ''Uncanny X-Men'' and the second volume of ''X-Men'' and was also featured in ''[[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]]'' from 1975 to 1978<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Karen |title='We'll Keep on Fighting 'Til the End': The Story of the Champions|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65|pages=17–23|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> and ''[[Defenders (comics)|The New Defenders]]'' from 1983 to 1986 as a member. He was a main character in the first volume of ''X-Factor'', and a star in flashback stories when he was a teenager in ''X-Men: The Hidden Years'' and ''X-Men: First Class''.

In April 2015, in issue 40 of ''All-New X-Men'', a time-displaced version of the teenaged Iceman was revealed as [[gay]] by his teammate, [[Jean Grey]], who discerned this with her telepathic ability.<ref>Hanks, Henry.

Retrieved June 12, 2015.</ref> This raised questions, because the character's adult, present-day counterpart had previously been portrayed dating women. In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #600, which was published in November that year, the young Iceman confronts his older self, who confirms that he is gay as well but repressed his true self, not wanting to be both gay and a mutant.<ref>Wong, Curtis M.

==Fictional character biography==

===Main Timeline Iceman===
====Early life====
'''Robert Louis "Bobby" Drake''' was born in [[Floral Park, New York|Floral Park]], [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to William Robert Drake and Madeline Beatrice Bass-Drake. His father is [[Irish-American]] [[Catholic]], and his mother is [[Jewish-American|Jewish]].<ref>''Iceman'' #1 (December 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref> Bobby's powers first manifested when he was on a date with Judy Harmon, and a local bully by the name of Rocky Beasely tried to take Judy away for himself. Knowing Judy could not put up a good fight, Bobby pointed his hand at Beasely and encased him in a block of ice. Later, the local townspeople, having heard of the incident, came looking for him in the form of an angry mob. The local sheriff had no choice but to put Bobby in jail for his own "protection". While Bobby sat in his cell at the sheriff station, the outer wall was blown open, and a young man named [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] walked in and offered to take Bobby with him. After Bobby turned him down, the two mutants got into a short battle, which was soon ended by the arrival of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]].<ref>''X-Men'' #44-46</ref>

After Xavier spoke with Bobby and his parents, Bobby's parents suggested that he go with Professor Xavier to his "school for gifted youngsters". Bobby took the suggestion and left with Professor Xavier and Cyclops to become the second member of the [[X-Men]]. He is later joined by [[Beast (comics)|Henry "Hank" McCoy]], [[Jean Grey]], and [[Warren Worthington III]] as the founding members of the X-Men. Drake remains self-conscious regarding the fact that he is the youngest member of the group. Appearing in his original snow covered form, he first battles [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] along with the rest of the team,<ref>''X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and later the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref>''X-Men'' #4</ref> Bobby Drake's first girlfriend is Zelda.<ref>''X-Men'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Not long after, he takes on a new ice-covered form.<ref name="X8">''X-Men'' #8 (November 1964)</ref>  He then teams up with the [[Human Torch]] for the first time.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #120</ref> The two would become close friends as time went on. With the X-Men, he visits the [[Savage Land]] and meets [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] for the first time.<ref>''X-Men'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then battles the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]],<ref>''X-Men'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> and is badly injured in his first battle against the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>''X-Men'' #14-17</ref> He next battles Magneto by himself.<ref>''X-Men'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he visits [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]] for the first time.<ref>''X-Men'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref> Then, he and Beast battle the [[Maha Yogi]].<ref>''X-Men'' #47</ref> During his original stint with the X-Men, Drake pursues a relationship with [[Polaris (comics)|Lorna Dane]], although the relationship does not last. Iceman is among the original X-Men captured by [[Krakoa]], leading to a new incarnation of X-Men of which he is not a member. With most of the original team, he quits the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #94. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Champions and Defenders====
Iceman moves to the American west coast to attend [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and becomes a founding member of [[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]] of Los Angeles.<ref>''Champions'' #1, October 1975. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the Champions soon dissolve.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Iceman is then abducted by [[Master Mold]], and alongside Angel, he encounters the [[Hulk]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman next aids the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in battling the [[Circus of Crime]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #76. Marvel Comics.</ref> Drake retires from life as a superhero to earn a college degree in accounting - but apparently at a college on the east coast, not UCLA.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #145, page 10, panel 1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While in college, he briefly rejoins the X-Men to rescue the captives of [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s henchman, Miss Locke.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #145-146. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Iceman is reunited with Beast, encounters [[Cloud (comics)|Cloud]], and then returns as a full-time superhero in an incarnation of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] alongside his former teammates, Angel and Beast.<ref>''Defenders'' #122-123, 125. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also battles [[Professor Power]]'s [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] while with the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' #127-129. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Defenders disband, Drake embarks on his career as an accountant.

Some time later, Iceman encounters Mirage, the "daughter" of [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]]. Iceman journeys back in time and meets his parents before he was born, and battles Oblivion and Mirage. He then reconciles with his parents.<ref>''Iceman'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====X-Factor====
The original X-Men, including Iceman, reunite to form the superhero team [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #1 (February 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref> With this new team, he encounters [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] for the first time.<ref>''X-Factor'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During his time with the team, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] captures Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Loki enhances Bobby's powers and then extracts them to restore the size of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Iceman is rescued by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Thor'' #377-378. Marvel Comics.</ref> Loki's tampering increases Bobby's powers to such an extent that he begins to lose control of his abilities. During a later battle with the [[The Right (comics)|Right]], he is fitted with a power-dampening belt which actually helps him control his abilities. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby finds he can encase the entirety of the [[Empire State Building]]. With time, Bobby gains sufficient control over his augmented powers and is able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he has achieved his full potential, Bobby does not attempt to develop his abilities further.

With X-Factor, Bobby then defeats [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Apocalypse's Horsemen]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman helps watch over many of the younger superheroes, something he once was. Most notably, he and Beast help [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] gain a more normal life. For a brief while, he also helps supervise the [[New Mutants]] and their sister team, the [[X-Terminators]]. They, in turn, save him from the deadly kiss of [[Infectia]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #29-31. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bobby also develops a romantic relationship with [[Opal Tanaka]]. After a session of ice sledding, she discovers threatening mail in her mailbox, a precursor to harassment by her cybernetically-enhanced relatives of the Tatsu Clan of the Yakuza, which Bobby helps her out with.<ref>''X-Factor'' #63-64. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the "[[Muir Island Saga]]", Iceman rejoins the X-Men along with the rest of X-Factor.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281; ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #1</ref>

====Back with the X-Men====
When he rejoined the X-Men it seemed that he learned to control his powers and no longer needed the inhibitor belt, this made him believe he reached the limit of his powers.<ref>''X-Factor'' #70</ref> The X-Men were separated into two groups, Iceman was placed in the gold team, led by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], along with fellow original X-Men Jean Grey (now sans codename) and Archangel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281. Marvel Comics.</ref>

One day he took Opal to eat with his parents, however his dad began humiliating her because of her Japanese heritage. The four are attacked by the Cyber-Samurai, which added to William Drake's prejudices about the girl.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #289. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Bobby came across [[Mikhail Rasputin]] he used his mutant abilities on him. Bobby discovered that his potential was still far from being reached as he converted his body into ice, not just covered by it.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #292. Marvel Comics.</ref> By turning his entire body to ice, instead of just wearing an icy exterior, Bobby now was capable of using his power in new, aggressive ways, adding spikes and padding to his ice structure.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #300. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Too busy with the many threats that the X-Men faced every day, Bobby let his relationship with Opal deteriorate and, when they finally saw each other again after weeks, it was only to save her from an attack by mutant haters. Annoyed that she could only gain his attention by nearly getting killed, Opal broke off their relationship.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #305. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, as he was checking on [[Emma Frost]] who was in a comatose state after the mutant [[Trevor Fitzroy]] unleashed the mutant-hunting Sentinels on Emma Frost and her students known as the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]], the mansion was hit by an electricity breakdown.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #311. Marvel Comics.</ref> Emma woke up disoriented, possessed Bobby's mind, and used his powers in ways Bobby never had; she froze an entire river and traveled through water. She was looking for her pupils but after finding out they were dead, she left Bobby's body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #314. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bobby invites Rogue to tag along on a visit to his parents. Wrongly assuming a romantic relation, his father disapproves of Rogue, verbally attacking them with the same prejudices he expressed with Opal. This time, Bobby had enough and left after telling his father that he should just accept the fact that he is a mutant and he would never fit the definition he has of normal. He was upset that Emma exhibited greater control of his powers than he had. Since Rogue was having problems with Gambit, the two of them go on a road trip to ease their minds.<ref name="Uncanny319"/>

During the Legion Quest, Iceman was one of the X-Men who went back in time to stop [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] from killing Magneto. They succeed, but only partially. Legion does not kill Magneto, but instead accidentally murdered Xavier, his own father, years before Legion had been conceived much less born. This paradox caused the events of the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. At the last moment before the original reality ended, Iceman's fellow X-Men, Rogue and Gambit shared a kiss. When reality resumed, Rogue's mind-absorbing touch renders Gambit comatose. Having absorbed some secret haunting memories, she needs to get away from the X-Men and Iceman volunteers to join her on a road trip, though at the same time he was starting to see visions of Emma Frost. When Gambit awoke from his coma, he tracked them down and confronted Rogue about what she saw in his mind. She broke off their relationship officially and left for good. Iceman and Gambit returned to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men (2nd series)'' #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When the entity known as [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] first appeared, Iceman was chosen as one of his test subjects, along with Storm, Cyclops and Wolverine. They were pitted against a servant of Onslaught named [[Post (comics)|Post]], in a specific battle area of harsh environment to test the extent of their abilities. They won and were returned to the mansion. However, Iceman's chest had been shattered in his ice form during battle, making it impossible to change back to human form.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol 2) #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> He confronted Emma Frost and demanded to know what she did to his powers in his body and how to save himself. She refused to help since she knew that Bobby would have to do it himself. When he captured her with his ice powers, she telepathically showed him his insecurities. By confronting Opal and his father in her simulation, Iceman realized that Emma was right and managed to transform back to his human body with his chest fully intact.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #331">''Uncanny X-Men'' #331. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Graydon Creed was running for President (with a heavy anti mutant campaign), Bobby was chosen to infiltrate in the campaign. His father stood out in a crowd and spoke in favor of the mutants, which came as a surprise to Bobby. His father's connection with Bobby was discovered, so the people that worked for Graydon captured him and almost beat him to death. Bobby decided to stay away from the X-Men for a while to be with his dad.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #340. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Zero Tolerance came across and Bobby found and helped Cecilia Reyes who was trying to keep a secret that she was a mutant. They also joined with Charlotte Jones and the morlock Marrow. After Bastion was defeated, he took Cecilia and Marrow to the mansion, and soon left the X-Men again for a while to be with his parents.<ref>''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #69. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Much later, the X-Men found evidence in one of Destiny's journals of a group known as the Twelve, including Xavier, Magneto, Cyclops, Phoenix, Iceman, Polaris, Storm, Cable, Bishop, Sunfire, Mikhail Rasputin and the [[Living Monolith]]. They also learned that the Apocalypse's Horsemen had been kidnapping these mutants from around the globe. Iceman was captured in the woods near his home by Deathbird, who had become the Horseman War.<ref>''X-Men'' (2nd series) #96. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gathering the remaining Twelve, the X-Men traveled to Egypt and confronted Apocalypse and the Skrulls. Apocalypse and his forces captured all of the Twelve during the battle, using them in a ritual to give the Chaos-Bringer a new body and incredible power. Magneto and Polaris created opposite magnetic polarities, Iceman, Storm, and Sunfire provided elemental extremes, Cyclops, Phoenix, and Cable gave the sheer power of family, Xavier represented the power of mind and Bishop and Mikhail stood for time and space, while the Monolith linked all their energies together. Nate Grey was to be Apocalypse's new host, a powerhouse to store his massive lifeforce. The Twelve managed to free themselves and Cyclops sacrificed his own body and lifeforce to keep Apocalypse from getting Nate. Though the new Apocalypse was defeated, Cyclops seemed lost forever.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol 2) #97. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After that incident, Iceman helped the Beast to secretly enter Genosha, as he wanted to study the legacy-infected mutates. When the High Evolutionary released his anti-mutation wave, they were trapped in the war-ravaged country. With the aid of Magneto, they escaped and joined forces with the rest of the scattered X-Men. They raided the Evolutionary's satellite, disabled the mutation field and defeated Sinister, who had been manipulating the Evolutionary.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #379. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #99. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #380. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Iceman was recruited by the living ship [[Prosh (Marvel Comics)|Prosh]], along with other mutants, like Jean Grey, Mystique, Toad and Juggernaut, to preserve evolution and save it. In this journey Iceman developed his powers even further, which led him to no longer be afraid of the natural course of his powers and he returned to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Forever'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref> He joined a new team of X-Men, consisting of Angel, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Wolverine and Chamber. He was using his abilities in a whole new way now, just channeling the power and not turning his body into ice.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #395. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Second mutation====
{{MOS|date=March 2015}}
During a heated battle with a recently evolved [[Black Tom Cassidy]], he received a chest wound. After returning to normal his chest did not fully recover and some parts of it remained icy, and he was unable to return them to normal. At first he became afraid of it but in time it made him gain a new attitude in life, even rude at some times.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #413. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Nobody seemed to realize it at the time, but evidently this was an early sign of Iceman undergoing a secondary mutation of his own. When he repeatedly tried to evade his regular medical check-ups, school nurse [[Annie Ghazikhanian]] recognized that something odd was going on with him and pressured him to show her the wound. Bobby made her promise not to tell anyone and showed her that parts of his chest are now made of ice and he is unable to change them back to flesh and blood. Iceman wonders if he will entirely turn into ice on a permanent basis.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #415">''Uncanny X-Men'' #415. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He developed an attitude that, to some of the newer addition to the X-Men, like [[Stacy X]], [[Juggernaut (Marvel Comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], he comes across as rather arrogant, denouncing their status as team members, as they have not been around as long as he. Iceman even went as far as offending [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] by claiming that only the original five, and no one else, has the right to call themselves an X-Man.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #420. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bobby was further frustrated when Havok and Polaris announced their imminent wedding, him having carried a torch for Lorna for quite some time. In his frustration he turned to Annie, who had problems with the wedding too, as she was secretly in love with Havok. The nurse surprised him with the accusation of him being a racist - feeling comfortable as a mutant who could pass like a human when needed, opposed to being a fully obvious mutant or a "mere" human. With his secondary mutation manifesting, though, Iceman was in danger of losing this status. Shocked by the truth of her words, Bobby fully opened up about his fears, that as a man fully made of ice he could never feel the warmth of a physical relationship again. Touched, Annie allowed him to kiss her, but when Havok called off the wedding, wanting to be with Annie instead, she quickly dumped Bobby.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #426">''Uncanny X-Men'' #426. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Upon encountering [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] and his followers, Iceman's body is shattered from the neck down. Afterward, he regains his entire ice form, but cannot change back to his human appearance. As a result, Bobby becomes both bitter and despondent because of this drastic change.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #429">''Uncanny X-Men'' #429. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Rogue's Team====
Iceman joins [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s team after she tells him that she wants him as a member.{{issue|date=March 2018}} They develop a romantic [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] after she and Gambit break up.{{issue|date=March 2018}} Their first mission as a team is to fight a new threat, a powerful group known as the [[Children of the Vault]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #188 (July 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> The team is successful and during this time, Bobby learns that he can be completely destroyed but then pull himself back together again. It was shown several times during the arc.

The next mission for the team was to locate a man called Pandemic and defeat him. The team was again successful, but Rogue was infected with a virus called Strain 88. [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] took the team, including Bobby, to his island so Rogue could get treatment.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #s 194-197. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While on Cable's island, the team and Iceman began working to defeat the [[Shi'ar]] weapon known as the Hecatomb. During the chaos, he shared a passionate kiss with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].<ref name="X-Men vol. 2 #190">''X-Men'' vol. 2 #190. Marvel Comics.</ref> Even as he did so, he saved many lives by containing the explosion of the Conquistador, and, later, the Hecatomb itself.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #199. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Blinded by the Light====
As the team recovers from Hecatomb attack in Rogue's childhood home, it appears that Mystique and Iceman begin a romantic relationship.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #200. Marvel Comics.</ref> This was a front, as Mystique was using Iceman and the X-Men as a [[Marauders (comics)|Marauder]] spy for [[Mister Sinister]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #201. Marvel Comics.</ref> Marauders soon infiltrated the house; they attempt to gain access to [[Destiny (Irene Adler)#The Books of Truth|Destiny's Diaries]] on the order of Mr. Sinister (who has been gathering information about the future from anybody and anything that could foretell the future). Bobby and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] escape from the Marauders in the [[Blackbird (comics)|X-Jet]], with help from [[Emma Frost]]. They are pursued by [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]; they manage to get the better of him and take him prisoner, but not before he manages to cripple the jet. While Sunfire is unconscious, Iceman and Sam discuss the Mauraders' plan to eliminate all precognitive mutants and anyone with knowledge of the future as well as retrieving Destiny's Diaries before the Marauders can. During this time, Bobby displayed sub-atomic control of energy transfers when he prevented Sunfire from using his fire-based powers.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #202. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Cannonball and Bobby, telepathically prompted by Emma Frost, attempt to recover the diaries which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery. Mr. Sinister uses the reverse-engineered version of Xavier's [[Cerebro]] to track the pair of X-Men to the brewery. The Marauders attack Cannonball and Iceman and overtake them. Bobby, while in his ice form, suffers a gunshot wound from Mystique, which severs one of his arms above the elbow. Mister Sinister, who takes Cannonball prisoner, attempts to telepathically erase his mind so that the X-Men will find him as an empty shell.  Iceman attacks Sinister, distracting him, which allows both of the X-Men to escape.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #203. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Messiah Complex====
{{Main|X-Men: Messiah Complex}}
The [[New X-Men]] team decided to raid the headquarters of the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] in Washington, D.C., but were forced to retreat. [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] teleported them back to the mansion in a rush, but the entire team was scattered between D.C. and Westchester.

===Time-displaced Iceman===
====All-New X-Men====
[[File:All_new_x-men_iceman.jpg|thumb|The young time-displaced Iceman by Stuart Immonen]]
Following the [[Avengers Vs. X-Men|war with the Phoenix Five]], as Cyclops begins to lash out against government oppression of mutants, a chance comment by Bobby about how the old Cyclops wouldn't tolerate what he is currently doing inspires Beast to travel back in time and recruit [[Uncanny X-Men#1963–1970: Original run|the original five X-Men]] to stop Cyclops.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #1.

Later, the younger, time-displaced Bobby is forced to confront being gay by his teammate, Jean, who privately asks him why he calls women "hot", when she knows via her psychic abilities that he is gay. This causes the younger Bobby to speculate as to the complicated identity issues faced by his older self and the decisions his older self may have made in the time between them.<ref name="All-New X-Men #40">''All-New X-Men'' #40.

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:X-Factor 27.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Iceman creates an ice slide on the cover of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #27 (1988).  Art by [[Walt Simonson]].]]
Iceman possesses the power to instantly decrease the temperature of ambient [[water vapor]] in his immediate environment to below zero degrees Celsius, thereby freezing it into ice. He is able to make ice that will not break unless he wills it to. In this manner he is able to quickly form a great variety of ice structures, including projectiles, shields, ladders, baseball bats, etc. Iceman often makes ice slides which form rapidly beneath and behind his feet, moving him along the slick surface at high speeds.  He is also able to form exceedingly complicated structures within relative short time, such as miniature cities.<ref name="Uncanny319">''Uncanny X-Men'' #319. Marvel Comics.</ref> Originally, Iceman's own body temperature would lower dramatically when his powers were active, reaching {{convert|-105|°F|°C|abbr=on}} within a few tenths of a second (now his body usually converts to organic ice; see below).  Iceman is immune to sub-zero temperatures; he is also able to perceive the [[thermal energy]] level of objects around him. Because [[cold]] is the absence of heat, Iceman does not actually 'emanate' cold; rather, he decreases thermal energy. As mentioned by writer [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]], Iceman is "an [[mutant (Marvel Comics)#Omega-level mutants|Omega-level mutant]]...[and] has powers that can influence the ecosystem of the entire world."<ref name="Carey"/> Iceman has yet to tap into his full mutant potential, but over the years he has taken more interest in developing his abilities.{{issue|date=May 2015}}

In his early appearances, Iceman generally covered his body in a thick layer of what appeared to be snow; hence he looked more like a traditional snowman than an ice-man. Upon further training in the use of his powers, he was able to fashion an armor of solid ice around his body when using his powers, which afforded him some degree of protection against concussive force and projectiles. Later on, he manifested the ability to convert the tissue of his body into organic ice. He sometimes augments his organic ice form with razor sharp adornments to his shoulders, elbows, knees, and fists. Iceman has also been able to move rapidly to another distant location while in his organic ice form, being able to deposit his bodily mass into a river and reconstitute his entire mass a great distance away in a matter of minutes (by temporarily merging his molecules with those of the river). On one occasion, Iceman suffered a severe chest injury while in his ice form and was able to heal himself by converting back into his normal human form.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

Iceman is also able to reconstitute his organic ice form if any part of it is damaged, or even if it is completely shattered, without permanently harming himself. He can temporarily add the mass of a body of water to his own, increasing his mass, size, and strength. He can survive not only as ice, but as liquid water and water vapor. He can also transform his body from a gaseous state back to a solid, although it is physically and mentally taxing.<ref name="X-Men vol. 2 #190"/><ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #193. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman can also freeze sea water, as seen during the "[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]" [[story arc]]. While he usually does not use his powers in lethal ways, his powers are so vast that they extend to the molecular level, to the point that he can freeze all of the molecules of an object/being with a thought; he once froze every single molecule of water within the body of [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David Haller]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman is also able to dissolve his own icy constructs.<ref name="Uncanny319"/>

Iceman's powers were pushed to their limit while possessed by Emma Frost, who used Iceman to discover the fate of her [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]].  During this time Iceman was able to control all forms of moisture, freeze fluids inside people's bodies, travel as a liquid, solid or gas. Not even the combined might of the X-Men Gold team was able to stop Emma Frost in Iceman's body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #313-314. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following this, Bobby confronted Emma about how she was able to use his powers so effectively. While together they made some initial progress, she refused to train him further.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #331"/> Instead he turned to Storm because they share similar elemental powers and she agreed to tutor him.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #48. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Iceman was injected with Mister Sinister's neuro-inhibiter by Mystique, he was able to save himself by drawing in all of the ambient moisture around him, rapidly replacing his poisoned cells with healthy material before the injection could kill him.<ref name="X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3">''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the 2013–2014 "[[Battle of the Atom]]" storyline, Iceman's future self revealed that he has the ability to create semi-independent ice structures that can act on their own,<ref name="WolX37">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #37. Marvel Comics.</ref> although one of these structures—demonstrating a Hulk-like physique and intellect—has gone on to join the future version of the Brotherhood.<ref name="WolX38">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #38. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Aside from his superhuman powers, Iceman is also a fair hand-to-hand combatant, and received combat training at Xavier's School as well as coaching from the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] while serving with the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions of Los Angeles]]. Iceman has taken as much combat training as Cyclops or Beast.<ref name="Carey">Richards, Dave (August 28, 2008).

==Characterization==

===Personality===
According to writer Mike Carey "one of Iceman's best personality traits is that emotionally Bobby Drake is like the ice he manipulates -- not cold but transparent. 'He's devastatingly honest. He is very up-front with his emotions and his thoughts all the time.'"<ref name="Carey"/> "Also, he's obviously incredibly brave both in terms of facing external, physical danger as well as facing up to unpleasant situations and admitting his own mistakes."<ref name="Carey"/>

===Friendships and relationships===
Iceman had a brief relationship with a Japanese-American New Yorker named Opal. He subsequently exhibited strong feelings for his fellow X-Man [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], but she did not return those feelings, due to her feelings towards Havok. [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] developed an unrequited crush for Iceman during their time on the same team, though Iceman never did find out about this.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #415"/> Iceman later had a brief relationship with the Xavier School's nurse, Annie, but she eventually left him for Havok, who had just left Polaris at the altar.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #426"/> When Iceman attempted to rekindle his relationship with Polaris, that too ended abruptly, and Polaris returned to Havok.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #429"/> Iceman then had a relationship with the X-Men's enemy Mystique, who later betrayed him, despite her continued fixation on him, in as much as she stated that she would either kill him or cure him of his personal uncertainty.<ref name="X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3"/>

===Sexuality===
In ''All-New X-Men'' #40, the time-displaced Iceman is revealed to be gay, which eventually forces the youth to confront the adult version of himself about the matter. As both speak, the adult Iceman confirms the fact and that he had put all his energy into just being an X-Man as he couldn't cope with being a mutant and gay simultaneously. With the help of his younger self and Jean Grey, however, he finally comes to terms with his own sexuality,<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #600"/> and comes out to fellow gay X-Man [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] in ''Extraordinary X-Men'' #6. The end of the Extermination X-Men event saw the forcing of the time displaced version of Bobby back into the closet when he returned to his original timeline alongside the other X-Men, due to a mind lock by Jean Grey, even though the current version retains his memories and remains an out gay man.<ref>https://www.cbr.com/extermination-x-men-breakdown/</ref>

==Other versions==

===1602===
Iceman is Roberto Trefusis in the miniseries ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', a member of the group of "witchbreeds" founded by [[Alternative versions of Professor X#1602|Carlos Javier]] and led by [[Alternative versions of Cyclops#1602|Scotius Summerisle]]. He is the nephew of naval commander [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]. As in the Marvel Universe, he generates ice and can assume a physical ice form.

==="Age of Apocalypse"===
{{Main|Age of Apocalypse}}
In the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline, Bobby, along with the rest of the X-Men, is trained by [[Magneto (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Magneto]].<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> Because Magneto is harder on his students than [[Professor X]], Bobby lacks his 616-counterpart's sense of humor.  Instead, Bobby becomes very cold and inhuman, making his teammates feel uncomfortable. In addition to his normal abilities, Bobby is capable of breaking down his body and merging it with another body of water to travel great distances in a matter of seconds. He can bring others along through a process that he calls "moisture [[Molecule|molecular]] inversion", though it is a painful process for the passengers. Bobby is also able to reconstitute his body from broken pieces. Just before Apocalypse's defeat, Colossus stormed right through Iceman, causing him to fall into pieces in an attempt to reach his sister.{{issue|date=May 2012}} A couple of months later, Iceman, [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], and [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]] were sent on a secret mission by Magneto; for a time, only Wild Child's fate was revealed.{{issue|date=May 2012}}

Iceman returned in the ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' arc "The Dark Angel Saga", when the title team was forced to travel to the AoA reality.<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/php/multimedia/album_view.php?gid=3387&page=5</ref> He abandoned the X-Men during a battle with the minions of Weapon X, who had by this time been transformed into that world's new Apocalypse, a defection later revealed to be the result of Iceman's having lost faith in his X-Men's ability to save their world. He was soon brought to Earth-616 by the Dark Beast, where he joined forces with Archangel on his quest to eradicate all life on Earth so he could create a new evolution process.{{issue|date=December 2011}} Tired of seeing the people he cared about being killed fighting what he thought to be an unwinnable war, Drake agreed to help Archangel - despite the latter's now being the mainstream Marvel Universe's version of Drake's X-Men's arch-enemy, Apocalypse - in exchange for transport to the relative paradise that was Earth-616.{{issue|date=October 2012}}

After X-Force defeated Archangel, Bobby managed to escape with McCoy and most of Archangel's other minions, but eventually broke away from them and went into hiding, living a life of hedonistic bliss in [[Madripoor]]. The "Age of Apocalypse" version of Nightcrawler - who, after being brought to Earth-616 along with the rest of his world's X-Men to help take down Archangel, decided to stay behind there in order to track down and kill the various villains who also came to the mainstream Marvel Universe - eventually tracked Bobby down to execute him for his treason. Nightcrawler is quickly overwhelmed by Drake's avatars, but eventually forces Iceman into a factory boiler room, where there's not enough moisture in the air for him to effectively use his powers. Nightcrawler quickly disables his former friend, and shoves him into an incinerator, killing the once noble hero.{{issue|date=May 2012}}

===''Earth X''===
During the miniseries ''[[Earth X]]'', Bobby had become trapped in his ice form, making him vulnerable to melting.  He moves to the [[Arctic]] regions of Earth, and made an ice city for himself and the [[Inuit]].  Due to a series of events where Earth's orbital path moves, Bobby is able to return to the [[United States]] to aid in the battle against the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].

Magneto sends Apocalypse to dispose of his rival [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]; when Apocalypse is attacked en route by Black Panther's allies, Iceman aids him by freezing [[Namor]] solid and attempting to attack Storm, but he is severely injured by Sunfire.<ref>''Black Panther'' Vol 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
A zombified Iceman appears in ''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'' alongside zombies Wolverine and Cyclops.{{issue|date=November 2012}} Ultimately, he is seen attacking Magneto. But Iceman perished at the hands of the Master Of Magnetism himself when Iceman is cut apart.{{issue|date=November 2012}}

===''Mutant X''===
In the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] universe, the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] amplified Bobby's powers to a dangerous level, leaving him unable to touch any living thing without killing it. Despite this, he retains a jovial and optimistic personality. When Havok has a disagreement with [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and decides to leave the X-Men, Ice-Man is one of those who follow him, becoming a founding member of the Six, who eventually come to be considered the world's premiere mutant team.<ref>''Mutant X'' #1 (October 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''New Exiles''===

This team includes Roberta "Bobby" Drake, a female version of Bobby who is codenamed Aurion and displays ice-based abilities.<ref>''New Exiles'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Battle of the Atom"===
In the alternate future witnessed in the "[[Battle of the Atom]]" storyline, Iceman's future self is shown in a long brown robe with a long beard and ice staff.{{issue|date=November 2016}} He has also developed the ability to create semi-independent ice structures that can act on their own, although one of these structures - demonstrating a Hulk-like physique and intellect - has gone on to join the future version of the Brotherhood, resulting in the Brotherhood using the duplicate to reinforce the illusion of themselves as the future X-Men. The duplicate Iceman was defeated by the O5 Iceman, the present Iceman, and the future Iceman during the battle in the past (Prompting the youngest Iceman to note that they only needed one more Iceman for a five-a-side basketball team).<ref name="WolX37"/>

===Ronin===

===Shadow-X===
[[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005–2007)|New Excalibur]] battles an evil counterpart of Iceman, who is a member of the [[Shadow-X]], the X-Men of an alternate reality in which Professor X was possessed by the [[Shadow King]]. They are brought to [[Earth-616]] as a result of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. He appeared to be mute and died during the final battle against Albion.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Bobby Drake is the youngest founding member of the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]]. He ran away from his family at the peak of government-supported [[Sentinel (comics)#Ultimate Sentinels|Sentinel]] attacks, fearing his family would be killed in such an attack.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

Ultimate Iceman never had the snowman look of his counterpart, instead generating a flexible ice armor from the beginning. Bobby establishes himself as a valuable asset, singlehandedly taking out the [[Ultimates]] once with a gigantic ice wall (''see [[Ultimate War]]''),{{issue|date=July 2012}} as well as singlehandedly halting an invasion by Colonel [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|Wraith]] and [[Weapon X]].{{issue|date=July 2012}} He was only able to be stopped by [[Rogue (comics)#Ultimate Rogue|Rogue]], who was in temporary possession of [[Jean Grey#Ultimate Jean Grey/Marvel Girl|Marvel Girl]]'s telepathy.{{issue|date=July 2012}} Professor X has stated that Bobby is one of the three most powerful X-Men.{{issue|date=July 2012}} During the ''World Tour'' arc, after enlarging his armor to form a gigantic ice troll, Bobby is greatly injured by [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]],{{issue|date=July 2012}} which resulted in a lawsuit issued by his parents against Xavier.{{issue|date=July 2012}} Bobby eventually rebels against his parents, and later returns to the X-Men.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

===Television===
[[File:Iceman (Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends).png|thumb|right|upright|Iceman as he appeared in ''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends''.]]
* Iceman's first television appearance was in the 1966 ''[[Namor|The Sub-Mariner]]'' portion of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' episode "Dr. Dooms Day".
* Iceman was one of the three main characters in the [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', voiced by [[Frank Welker]]. In a few episodes, he appears with his and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]]'s former teammates, the X-Men. In the episode "Vengeance Of Loki", he's revealed to be a government agent; his codename is "Windchill Factor Zero". In the episode "Mission: Save The Guardstar", [[Aurora Dante]] (Lightwave) (his half-sister) was introduced. One entire episode was devoted to Iceman's origin story. Throughout the series, Iceman has a romantic infatuation with [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]].
* He appeared in the [[X-Men (1992 TV series)|1992 ''X-Men'' animated series]], voiced by [[Dennis Akayama]]. He appears in the episode "Cold Comfort" as a former member of the team, who quit due to disagreements with Xavier. Iceman also appears in many flashbacks which include "Sanctuary Part 1" and "Xavier Remembers".
* He appeared in the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Andrew Francis]]. Iceman was meant to be the 8th X-Man of the show, but rejected in favor of [[Spyke]]. Not surprisingly, Iceman appeared more often when Spyke left. In the series, Iceman was a New Mutant and often acted as the unofficial leader of the [[New Mutants]], as he was the most adept of the group.
* Iceman appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'',{{vague|date=November 2011}}<!--which episodes?--> voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]. He appears as a member of the X-Men who left after [[Professor X]] went M.I.A. after the Institute was destroyed. Wolverine and Beast went to re-recruit him back on to the X-Men but his parents refused to allow him to return to the team after what happened. Being 18, Bobby had the choice to either stay at home or return to the X-Men and he made the choice to rejoin the team. Since he is still in his teens, he's shown at times acting like a typical teenage boy (such as his facial expression after [[Emma Frost]] walks by him in episode 3). He is also not fond of reading and is a bit lazy as he was napping on a pile of books instead of giving them to Kitty to put away. He apparently has a crush on Shadowcat, as he is caught staring at her dreamily before asking her out for a bite to eat (although they were already eating). It is also hinted she may share those feelings, as in episode 3 when Kitty elbows him for looking at Emma. In episode 20, someone similar to Iceman is shown as a member of the original five X-Men.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' - Episode 1: "Foresight"</ref>
* Iceman appears in the episode of ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' titled "Mysterious Mayhem at Mutant Academy", with [[Shawn Ashmore]] reprising his role as the character from the live action ''X-Men'' films. He is shown as a student at Xavier Academy and classified as the class clown. He has a starring role in the later episode "The Ice Melt Cometh" where he is needed to re-freeze the melted polar ice caps.<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm Comics Continuum]</ref>

===Film===
[[File:Movieiceman.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bobby Drake/Iceman as portrayed by Shawn Ashmore in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'']]
In the films, ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', and ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', he is played by [[Shawn Ashmore]]. Bobby is one of the first students to reach out to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and begins a romantic relationship with her. In ''X2'', he has an uneasy friendship/rivalry with [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]]. His relationship with his family is also strained, and his brother actually turns Bobby in to the police out of jealousy. In ''X-Men: The Last Stand'', his relationship with Rogue appears to be deteriorating, strained by their inability to have physical contact and by his close friendship with [[Kitty Pryde]]. During a battle with Pyro, now working for Magneto's Brotherhood, he achieves the ability to transform into his ice form from the comics. In the original dystopian timeline of ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'',<ref>[https://twitter.com/BryanSinger/status/324237075299856384]</ref>  Iceman is more powerful, transforming into ice and travelling on ice slides, but is nevertheless killed while fighting the [[Sentinel (Marvel Comics)|Sentinels]]. After Kitty and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] change the timeline, Iceman is seen once again in a relationship with Rogue at the Xavier Mansion. Bobby's scenes vary in the ''Days of Future Past'' known as ''The Rogue Cut'', where he is killed by Sentinels while helping Rogue and Magneto to escape.<ref name="RogueCut">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2211098/x-men-rogue-cut-review/|title=Every Secret We Learned Watching The ‘X-Men: Rogue Cut’|last=McNally|first=Victoria|date=July 12, 2015|publisher=[[MTV.com]]|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}</ref>

* Iceman appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' as a playable character, retaining many of his moves from the ''Legends'' games, and voiced again by James Arnold Taylor.<ref name="btva"/> His Age of Apocalypse appearance (referred to as Spikey), classic costume (his standard look), original costume (his first comic appearances, with his face completely frosted over), and Bobby Drake (the look he adopts in the ''New X-Men'' series and his subsequent solo series: he appears in his human form, wearing a leather trenchcoat, with only his hands appearing frozen) are alternate costumes for Iceman. In this game, he retains his ''X-Men Legends'' abilities, like that of creating ice slides instead of double-jumping. He has special dialogue with [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Namor]] (when he's sick), [[Namorita]], [[Professor X]], [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Henry Pym]], and [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]]. Also, at the beginning of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s Realm, he complains to Xavier about being in Mephisto's Realm (due to all the fire and lava). A simulation disk has Iceman fighting [[Mysterio]] in [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s Realm and another one has Storm defending him and Wolverine from [[Hussar (comics)|Hussar]] in Murderworld.<ref name="MUA1">{{cite book |title=Marvel Ultimate Alliance: Signature Series Guide |first=Thom |last=Denick |publisher=Brady Games |location=Indianapolis, Indiana| isbn=0-7440-0844-1 |year=2006 |pages=14, 15}}</ref>
