[[Commander]] '''Maria Hill''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|r|aɪ|ə}} {{Respell|mə|RY|ə}}) is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. As the former Director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], she appears in various storylines which often feature the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] or members of that group. She was featured in the late 2000s "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" and "[[Secret Invasion]]" miniseries, and the monthly ''[[Iron Man]]'' series, in which she was a prominent supporting character during the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" and "Stark Disassembled" storylines.

[[Cobie Smulders]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), and as [[Skrull]] Soren who takes Hill's form in ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019). She also appeared in two episodes of the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)|first season]] and one episode of the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]] of the television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''

== Publication history ==
Maria Hill first appeared in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #4 (March 2005), and was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]].

[[Joe Quesada]], who was Marvel's editor-in-chief during her first appearance, describes the character thus: "[Hill] is such a strong personality, she's like a force of nature and quite frankly, while perhaps not immediately loved by all involved, she's certainly as strong and imposing a figure as Nick Fury. Right now I feel that people view her as the outsider but [while] I don't think she's any harsher than Fury has ever been, what's different is that we aren't quite clear about her motives."{{dead link|date=January 2012}}<ref>[[Quesada, Joe]]. [http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays12.html "Joe Fridays"]. [[Newsarama]]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115101309/http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays12.html |date=November 15, 2006 }}</ref>

Maria Hill appeared as a supporting character in the 2010–2013 ''Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue, #34 (January 2013), but only appeared sporadically after the first half of its run.

In 2014, Maria Hill was a regular character in ''[[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]]'' and ''[[Secret Avengers]]''.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Introduction ===
Hill, who was born in [[Chicago]],<ref>''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' #5</ref> joins the United States armed forces and later becomes an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Iron Man: World's Most Wanted''</ref>

The Avengers suspect Hill of being complicit in various crimes, but lack evidence to prove her malfeasance. At the same time, Hill suspects the latest incarnation of the Avengers are harboring an illicit agenda in connection with the "[[House of M]]" affair. She abducts [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] to question them about the situation.<ref>''New Avengers Vol 1'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She earns [[Iron Man]]'s respect when she ignores the [[President of the United States|President]]'s orders to nuke an island while the Avengers are on it.<ref>''New Avengers Vol 1'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== "Civil War" ===
In the 2006–2007 storyline "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]", [[Captain America]] refuses to assist Commander Hill in preparations to arrest any superheroes who refuse to comply with the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]], seeing such activity as politically motivated, but Hill, arguing that Captain America must obey the will of the American people, attempts to arrest him. Captain America fights his way out of the [[Helicarrier]] and escapes.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Mark Millar]]|penciller=[[Steven McNiven]]|inker=[[Dexter Vines]]|title=Civil War|issue=1|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=July 2006}}</ref> After the Act passes into law, Hill is one of its leading enforcers. She blackmails [[Wonder Man]] into actively supporting S.H.I.E.L.D.'s crusade to hunt down the superheroes opposed to the Registration Act. She sends [[Kree]] supersoldier [[Noh-Varr]], already brainwashed, to capture the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]. She directs the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] to capture [[Spider-Man]] after he goes rogue. The two Thunderbolts members sent out, [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], are slain by the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher War Journal''. Marvel Comics.</ref>{{issue|date=January 2017}} After foiling an attack on [[Stark Tower]], Hill admits to Tony Stark that she does not want her job as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and thinks she should not have been offered it in the first place. She suggests that the only other person besides [[Nick Fury]] who should lead the organization is Stark himself.<ref>''New Avengers Vol 1'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> At the conclusion of the Civil War, the President of the United States appoints Tony Stark the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D., with a displeased Maria Hill his acting deputy director.<ref>''Civil War'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Deputy Director ===
After being made Deputy Director, Maria Hill becomes a core member of Stark's S.H.I.E.L.D. cabinet and assists Stark in dealing with a sudden rise in various terrorist groups who have gained access to hyper-advanced biological weapons. Unlike the rest of the cabinet (including Sal Kennedy, whom she loathed personally), Hill remains skeptical of a single conspiracy behind all these attacks.<ref>''Iron Man, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]'s neoplastic tumor began infecting the Helicarrier, Hill organizes the evacuation; she (wrongly) believed the infection is the main objective of the attack.<ref>''Iron Man, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Subsequently, however, Hill becomes much more trusting in Stark's leadership, a trusted agent in her role as Deputy Director, and far less bound by conventional process, particularly after a confrontation with Dum Dum Dugan, in which he forces her to confront the fact that she was apparently willing to take actions that would allow innocent people to die while still sticking to "the book" because the alternative was to disobey orders.<ref>''Iron Man'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> She eventually risks her career by locking down the [[United Nations]] under S.H.I.E.L.D. martial law so Stark can escape a tribunal going against him and track down the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== 2008–2010 storylines ===
During the 2008 "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, after the Helicarrier is disabled by [[Skrull]] invaders, Hill, who is left in charge in Stark's absence, confronts a number of extraterrestrial Skrulls, [[shapeshifter]]s who can assume the appearance of anyone or anything, who are revealed to have replaced [[Edwin Jarvis]] and a number of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Skrulls execute Hill, but this "Hill" is revealed to be a [[Life Model Decoy]] of Hill. Hill then activates the Helicarrier's self-destruct system, killing all the Skrull infiltrators on board, escaping via jet pack.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the aftermath of the Skrull Invasion's failure, during the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, S.H.I.E.L.D is disbanded by the President, and Hill and Tony Stark lose their jobs, replaced by the newly appointed director [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] who then reforms the fallen S.H.I.E.L.D. into [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]]<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the ''Iron Man'' monthly series, Hill tries to go about having a normal life but Osborn dispatches H.A.M.M.E.R. to arrest her for theft. She joins her former boss, Tony Stark, as a fugitive after he stole the Superhuman Registration Database. The night before Tony leaves the two have a sexual tryst.<ref>[[Fraction, Matt]] (w), [[Larocca, Salvador]] (a). ''The Invincible Iron Man Vol 5'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hill is sent on a mission by Tony to retrieve a hard drive. Hill finds the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]] holed up in the basement of Futurepharm, hooked into a large machine holding many people in containers. She barely manages to escape him, before downloading the data Tony sent her for. The skirmish with the Controller would leave her in a state of paranoia for a while. She then enlists the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] to deliver the data to [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]], all the while evading H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. However, they are captured when H.A.M.M.E.R. intercepts an e-mail from Stark. They are rescued by Pepper Potts, disguised as Madame Masque.<ref>Fraction, Matt (w), Larocca, Salvador (a). ''Invincible Iron Man'' #11–18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the 2010 "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]" storyline, Hill comes to the aid of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] after Osborn launches an attack on him and his home of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''Siege'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hill becomes a supporting cast member in the Iron Man series, protecting him and his friends from multiple threats.<ref>"Invincible Iron Man" #20–28 (2008–2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> In the 2010 "[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]" storyline, which followed "Siege", Hill is appointed by Captain Steve Rogers to work with a new team of Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== 2010 to the present ===
Following the apparent death of Nick Fury, she was appointed commander, then acting director, and finally director of S.H.I.E.L.D. following [[Daisy Johnson]]'s actions that involved the [[Secret Avengers]] invading A.I.M. Island.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #1-8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, Hill and S.H.I.E.L.D. have established Pleasant Hill, a super villain prison designed to resemble a gated community. While working at Pleasant Hill, Maria Hill operates as the Mayor of Pleasant Hills. A training video for the S.H.I.E.L.D. cadets working there showed that she and the S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists have used reality-warping technology derived from the [[Cosmic Cube]] called "Kobik" as a demonstration was used where [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] is turned into a mild-mannered Pleasant Hill chef named Howie Howardson.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hill'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Commander Steve Rogers is brought before Maria Hill, he tells her of his knowledge that the Kobik project was not disposed of. Maria Hill presented the inhabitants of Pleasant Hill to Steve Rogers: she mentions that the citizens are reformed supervillains. When Steve Rogers demanded to know where were the fragments of Cosmic Cubes used for Kobik, she directed him to the eerie little girl who was the fragments of the Cosmic Cube that have taken the form of a near-omnipotent child.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Civil War II]]" storyline, Maria Hill was later seen being kidnapped by [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]], who attempted to extract the security code clearances for all the active helicarriers and the [[Triskelion]], when she was rescued by [[Doctor Doom|Victor Von Doom]].<ref>''Infamous Iron Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

== Skills and abilities ==
Maria Hill is an extremely effective commander, leader, tactician, and military strategist. She is a highly skilled martial artist and hand-to-hand fighter, as well as being a proficient marksman and armed combatant.

== Other versions ==
=== MC2 ===
In the world of the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, Maria Hill is a member of the National Security Force. When a government assignment went awry a piece of the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] symbiote was released. The Symbiote was stopped by [[Spider-Girl]], the daughter of [[Spider-Man]], as she later reported the success to that world's Nick Fury. She is later seen accusing [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]] of the [[A-Next]], for crimes against the US, as the heroine stumbles upon a government mission.<ref>''American Dream'' #1–5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== Ultimate Marvel ===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Maria Hill is an ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent and a homicide detective currently working for the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]. She first appears while questioning [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]] about the death of [[Prowler (comics)|Aaron Davis]]. This investigation led to the discovery that Spider-Man wasn't the killer as the press believed and that Aaron Davis had an accidental death when one of his weapons backfired.<ref>''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

She is the one working on the Venom case that involved a home invasion into Miles Morales' house and hurt his father. She notices that Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, Ganke, and Miles quickly went into his home. She illegally barges in, but is coy with the kids, only to be thwarted by Gwen's knowledge of law due to her deceased father, and Mary Jane recording her on her tablet. Maria definitely suspects Miles as Spider-Man. Suddenly, there is word that Venom is attacking the hospital where Miles father and mother are at. Maria yells at Miles telling him to save the citizens at the hospital. Miles scales the light post and buildings in front of Maria confirming that he is Spider-Man.{{issue|date=January 2017}}
