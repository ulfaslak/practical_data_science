==Publication history==
[[File:Tales of Suspense 52.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #52 (April 1964), the debut of Black Widow. Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Paul Reinman]]]]

The Black Widow's first appearances were as a recurring, non-costumed, [[Russia]]n-[[espionage|spy]] antagonist in the feature "[[Iron Man]]", beginning in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #52 (April 1964). Five issues later, she recruits the besotted costumed archer and later superhero [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] to her cause. Her government later supplies her with her first Black Widow costume and high-tech weaponry, but she eventually defects to the United States after appearing, temporarily brainwashed against the U.S., in the superhero-team series ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]'' #29 (July 1966). The Widow later becomes a recurring ally of the team before officially becoming its sixteenth member many years later.

The Black Widow was visually updated in 1970: ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #86 (July 1970) reintroduced her with shoulder-length red hair (instead of her former short black hair), a skintight black costume, and wristbands which fired spider threads. This would become the appearance most commonly associated with the character.<ref name="back45">{{cite journal|last= Carson|first= Lex|date= December 2010|title= Daredevil and the Black Widow: A Swinging Couple of Crimefighters|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45| pages= 31–38|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

In short order, The Black Widow starred in her own series in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' #1–8 (Aug. 1970–Sept. 1971), sharing that split book with the feature [[Inhumans]]. The Black Widow feature was dropped after only eight issues (the Inhumans feature followed soon, ending with issue 10).<ref name="back45"/>

Immediately after her initial solo feature ended, the Black Widow co-starred in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] '' #81–124 (Nov. 1971–Aug. 1975), of which #92-107 were cover titled ''Daredevil and the Black Widow''. ''Daredevil'' writer [[Gerry Conway]] recounted, "It was my idea to team up Daredevil and the Black Widow, mainly because I was a fan of Natasha, and thought she and Daredevil would have interesting chemistry."<ref name="back45"/> Succeeding writers, however, felt that Daredevil worked better as a solo hero, and gradually wrote the Black Widow out of the series.<ref name="back45"/> She was immediately recast into the super-team series ''[[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]]'' as the leader of the titular superhero group, which ran for 17 issues (Oct. 1975–Jan. 1978).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Karen|title='We'll Keep on Fighting 'Til the End': The Story of the Champions|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65|pages=17–23|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Black Widow appeared frequently as both an Avengers member and a freelance agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] She starred in a serialized feature within the omnibus comic-book series ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #10–13 (Aug. 1983–March 1984), written by [[George Pérez]] and [[Ralph Macchio (editor)|Ralph Macchio]], with art by [[penciller]] Perez. These stories were later collected in the oversized [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Black Widow: Web of Intrigue'' #1 (June 1999).

The Widow guest-starred in issues of ''Solo Avengers'', ''[[Force Works]]'', ''Iron Man'', ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', and other comics. She had made frequent guest appearances in ''Daredevil'' since the late 1970s.

She starred in a three-issue arc, "The Fire Next Time", by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and penciller Randy Green, in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #517–519 (Feb.–April 1998).

A new ongoing ''Black Widow'' comic title debuted in April 2010. The first story arc was written by [[Marjorie Liu]] with art by [[Daniel Acuña]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24463 |title=Marvel Comics Solicitations for April 2010 |website=Comic Book Resources|date=January 19, 2010|accessdate=January 10, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404102018/https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-solicitations-for-april-2010/|archivedate=April 4, 2019}}</ref> Beginning with issue #6 (Sept. 2010), the title was written by [[Duane Swierczynski]], with artwork by [[Manuel Garcia (artist)|Manuel Garcia]] and [[Lorenzo Ruggiero]].

Black Widow appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 ''[[Secret Avengers]]'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Avengers36panel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|First costume (and bouffant hairdo). From ''The Avengers'' #36 (Jan. 1967), art by [[Don Heck]].]]
Natasha was born in [[Stalingrad]] (now Volgograd), [[RSFSR|Russia]]. The first and best-known Black Widow is a [[Russians|Russian]] agent trained as a spy, martial artist, and sniper, and outfitted with an arsenal of high-tech weaponry, including a pair of wrist-mounted energy weapons dubbed her "Widow's Bite". She wears no costume during her first few appearances but simply [[formal wear|evening wear]] and a veil. Romanova eventually defects to the U.S. for reasons that include her love for the reluctant-criminal turned superhero [[Archery|archer]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].

The first hints to Natasha Romanova's childhood come from Ivan Petrovich, who is introduced as her middle-aged chauffeur and confidant in the Black Widow's 1970s ''[[Amazing Adventures]]''. Petrovich tells [[Matt Murdock]] that he had been given custody of little Natasha by a woman who died immediately afterwards, during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in autumn 1942. He consequently felt committed to raise the orphan as a surrogate father and she eventually trained as a [[Soviet]] spy, being eager to help her homeland.<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' issue #88 (June 1972)</ref> In another [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], set in the fictional island of [[Madripoor]] in 1941, Petrovich helps [[Captain America]] and the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] Logan, who would later become the [[Canadians|Canadian]] super-agent and costumed hero [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], to rescue Natasha from [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men|The Uncanny X-Men]]'' issue #268 (Sept. 1990)</ref>

A revised, [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] origin establishes her as being raised from very early childhood by the U.S.S.R.'s "Black Widow Ops" program, rather than solely by Ivan Petrovitch.<ref>''Black Widow'' #1–6 (Nov. 2004–April 2005)</ref> Petrovitch had taken her to Department X, with other young female orphans, where she was [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] and trained in combat and espionage at the covert "[[Red Room (comics)|Red Room]]" facility. There, she is biotechnologically and psycho-technologically enhanced—which provides a rationale for her unusually long and youthful lifespan. During that time she had some training under the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]], and the pair even had a short romance.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 5, #27 (Aug. 2007)</ref> Each Black Widow is deployed with false memories to help ensure her loyalty. Romanova eventually discovers this, including the fact that she had never, as she had believed, been a [[ballerina]]. She further discovers that the Red Room is still active as "2R".

The KGB arranged a marriage between Natasha and the renowned Soviet test pilot [[Red Guardian#Alexei Shostakov|Alexei Shostakov]]. However, when the Soviet government decided to make Shostakov into their new operative, the Red Guardian, he is told that he can have no further contact with his wife. Natasha is told that he died and is trained as a secret agent separately.

===The Avengers===
Romanova grew up to serve as a femme fatale. She was assigned to assist [[Crimson Dynamo#The second Crimson Dynamo|Boris Turgenov]] in the assassination of [[Crimson Dynamo#The original Crimson Dynamo|Professor Anton Vanko]] for defecting from the Soviet Union, which served as her first mission in the United States. Natasha and Turgenov infiltrated [[Stark Industries]] as part of the plan.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' Vol 1 #52</ref> She attempted to manipulate information from American [[defense contractor]] Tony Stark, and inevitably confronted his superhero alter ego, [[Iron Man]]. The pair then battled Iron Man, and Turgenov stole and wore the Crimson Dynamo suit. Vanko sacrificed himself to save Iron Man, killing Turgenov in the process, using an unstable experimental laser light pistol.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #52–53 (Apr. 1964–May 1964)</ref> Romanova later meets the criminal archer [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and sets him against Iron Man,<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (Sept. 1964)</ref> and later helped Hawkeye battle Iron Man.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #60 (Dec. 1964)</ref>

Later, Natasha again attempted to get Hawkeye to help her destroy Iron Man. The pair almost succeeded, but when Black Widow was injured, Hawkeye retreated to get her to safety.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #64</ref> During this period, Romanova was attempting to defect from the Soviet Union and began falling in love with Hawkeye, weakening her loyalty to her country. When her employers learned the truth, the [[KGB]] had her gunned down, sending her to a hospital, convincing Hawkeye to go straight and seek membership in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #12</ref><ref>''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)</ref>

The Red Room kidnapped and [[brainwashes|brainwashed]] her again, and with the [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]] and the first [[Erik Josten|Power Man]], she battled the Avengers.<ref>''The Avengers'' #29–30 (June 1966–July 1966)</ref> She eventually broke free from her psychological conditioning (with the help of Hawkeye), and successfully defected, having further adventures with Spider-Man, with Hawkeye, and with Daredevil.{{issue|date=June 2012}} She ultimately joins the Avengers as a costumed heroine herself.<ref>''The Avengers'' #111 (May 1973)</ref>

===S.H.I.E.L.D. and Daredevil===
[[File:BlackWidow2005No1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Promotional art for ''Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her'' #1 (Nov. 2005), by [[Bill Sienkiewicz]].]]

Upon Nick Fury's request, she begins freelancing as an agent of the international espionage group [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] She is sent on a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. mission to China by [[Nick Fury]]. There, with the Avengers, she battles Col. Ling, Gen. Brushov, and her ex-husband the [[Red Guardian#Alexei Shostakov|Red Guardian]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #38–44 (Mar. 1967–Sept. 1967)</ref> For a time, as writer [[Les Daniels]] noted in a contemporaneous study in 1971,

{{quote|text=...&nbsp;her left-wing upbringing was put to better use, and she has lately taken to fighting realistic oppressor-of-the-people types. She helps young [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] clean up police corruption and saves young [[hippies]] from [[organized crime]].&nbsp; ... [The splash page of ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' #3 (Nov. 1970)] reflects the recent trend toward involving fantastic characters in contemporary social problems, a move which has gained widespread publicity for Marvel and its competitor, [[DC Comics|DC]].<ref>[[Les Daniels|Daniels, Les]]. ''Comix: A History of Comic Books in America'' (Fusion, 1971), pp. 142–143. {{ISBN|0-87690-034-1}}</ref>}}

She investigates a plot by Egghead, the Puppet Master and the Mad Thinker to blackmail the US government using a laser-firing satellite.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #12 (Apr. 1969)</ref><ref>''The Avengers'' #63-64 (Apr-May 1969)</ref>

During her romantic involvement with Matt Murdock in San Francisco, she operates as an independent superhero alongside Murdock's alter ego, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #81 (Nov. 1971)</ref> There she tries unsuccessfully to find a new career for herself as a fashion designer. Eventually, her relationship with Murdock stagnates, and after briefly working with Avengers finally breaks up with Murdock, fearing that playing "[[sidekick]]" is sublimating her identity.<ref>''Daredevil'' #124 (Aug. 1975)</ref> During a HYDRA attempt to take over S.H.I.E.L.D., she is tortured to such an extent that she regresses back to an old cover identity of schoolteacher Nancy Rushman, but she is recovered by [[Spider-Man]] in time to help Nick Fury and [[Shang-Chi]] work out what had happened and restore her memory, with "Nancy" developing an attraction to Spider-Man before her memory is restored during the final fight against Madam Viper, [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and the [[Silver Samurai]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #82–85 (June 1979–Sept. 1979)</ref> She later returns to Matt Murdock's life to find he is romantically involved with another woman, Heather Glenn,<ref>''Daredevil'' #157 (March 1979)</ref> prompting her to leave New York.<ref>''Daredevil'' #165 (July 1980)</ref> Natasha ultimately realizes that Matt still only thinks of her in platonic terms, and elects to restrain herself from any advances.<ref>''Daredevil'' #190 (Jan. 1983)</ref>

===The Champions===
After their breakup, the Widow moves to Los Angeles and becomes leader of the newly created and short-lived super team known as The Champions, consisting of her, [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] (Johnny Blaze), [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] (with whom she has a brief romance), and former [[X-Men]] [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]].<ref>''Champions'' #1–3 (Oct. 1975–Feb. 1976)</ref>

Her friends usually call her "Natasha", the informal version of "Natalia". She has sometimes chosen the last-name alias "Romanoff"—evidently as a private joke on those who are not aware that Russian family names use [[Eastern Slavic naming customs#Family name (surname)|different endings for males and females]]. She has been hinted to be a descendant of the deposed [[House of Romanov]] and a relation to [[Nicholas II of Russia]].

===21st century===
{{long plot|date=January 2018}}
Natasha crosses Daredevil's (Matt Murdock) path again when he attempts to slay an infant he believes to be the Anti-Christ while under the influence of mind-altering drugs. After Daredevil's one-time love, [[Karen Page]], dies protecting the child, Natasha reconciles with Murdock, revealing she still loves him, but noting that he is too full of anger to commit to a relationship with her.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #1–7 (Nov. 1998–May 1999)</ref>

Natasha is challenged by Yelena Belova, a graduate from the training program through which Natasha herself was taught the espionage trade, who is the first to ever surpass Natasha's marks and considers herself the rightful successor to the "Black Widow" mantle.<ref>''Black Widow'' vol. 1, #1</ref> Natasha refers to her as "little one" and "rooskaya (meaning "Russian"), and encourages her to discover her individuality rather than live in blind service, asking her "why be Black Widow, when you can be Yelena Belova?"<ref>''Black Widow'' vol. 1, #2</ref> After several confrontations, Natasha subjects Yelena to intense [[psychological manipulation]] and suffering in order to teach her the reality of the espionage business, and an angry but disillusioned Yelena eventually returns home and temporarily quits being a spy.

Her ship is shot down during the battle though, and she is killed in the ensuing explosion.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1</ref>

As the evacuation of Earth-616 begins in light of the fact that Earth-1610 is about to come crashing down as part of the "Last Days" storyline, Black Widow is seen standing atop a building with Captain America who gives her a list of people to save and bring aboard the lifeboat. As she tells Sam she can't save them all, Sam explains it's Natasha's job to assist in the effort to save as many people as possible before Earth as they know it is destroyed. As she leaves, her mind transitions to [[Cold War]] Russia, where a young Natasha (here called Natalia) speaks with two Russian functionaries in the infamous "Red Room". She is given her first mission: travel to Cuba and locate a family called the Comienzas, who are at risk from [[Raúl Castro]]'s regime and who may have information of vital importance to Russia. She is told to rendezvous with another agent, her classmate Marina, and befriend the family under the guise of a Russian businesswoman. Natasha assures them of her competency and leaves. When one of the officers questions her youth, the other assures him, "she's a killer. She will not disappoint." Natasha meets Marina in Cuba and the two friends catch up before meeting with the Comienzas that night at a local bar. Using her talent for deception, she casually and politely convinces the husband and wife that she's seeking inside information to help her import various goods into the country. The Comienzas explain they can't reveal said information, prompting Natasha to later explain to Marina that the family might need "a little push". Not too soon she effectively began terrorizing the family into desperation. First, she plants an American flag on their doorstep to mimic someone accusing them of defecting to the United States. Later after meeting with one of the Russian officers from the Red Room to report her progress, she detonated a car bomb outside their home when the first attempt didn't make them "nearly desperate enough". Following the car bomb explosion, Natasha declares the family is indeed desperate enough to reproach for information. Before letting Natasha go, the officer announces she has one additional task before her mission is over: Marina has become too much enamored with her civilian guise, and is now a security risk. Natasha will have to eliminate her.<ref>''Black Widow'' Vol. 5 #19</ref> Flipping to the present, Black Widow is saving as many people as she can, but she quickly flashbacks to Havana. Natasha and her then Red Room partner Marina are trying to help a family defect. Natasha's orders are simple: Kill the parents and make it public. When Natasha asks if she should kill the child too, her boss looks horrified that she would be so OK with that and tells her no. Having no problem following orders she sets up a meet and using a sniper rifle she takes out the pair without blinking. Next she shoots Marina's boyfriend then Marina herself. Next she shoots Marina's cat. Flipping back to the present, Black Widow is back saving people from the incursion as the reason that triggered Natasha's flashback is revealed ... a man she saved is holding his cat. This dark, heartless side of the Black Widow shows why she is trying so hard to do good today.<ref>''Black Widow'' Vol. 5 #20</ref>
