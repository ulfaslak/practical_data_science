Thundra is a warrior woman and [[time travel]]er from an alternate future 23rd century. In the future society she hails from, planet [[Earth]] is now known as '''[[List of planets in Marvel Comics#Femizonia|Femizonia]]''' and is ruled by [[amazons|amazon]]-like female [[dominatrix|overlord]]s ([[Femizons]]) who have conquered and enslaved the diminished male population. The former [[United States]] is now the 'United Sisterhood Republic', and Thundra hails from the [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] of Greater Milago (a merged sprawl of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] and [[Chicago]]), located in the United Sisterhood's Midwestern Republic. Thundra is renowned as the United Sisterhood's most formidable warrior, having been physically enhanced by [[genetic engineering]] and trained from childhood in combat, the [[martial arts]], and military strategy.

She is sent to the 20th century to challenge Fantastic Four member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to a bout of one-on-one combat, believing him to be the strongest male of all time. By beating the Thing in combat, she feels she can prove once and for all that women were superior to the male [[gender]], and finally end a stagnant war between Femizonia and the warlike, male dominated planet of Machus, where the female population had been subjugated by its ruler [[Mahkizmo]].

Thundra is also recruited into the evil group of [[supervillain]]s known as the [[Frightful Four]] by the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], and they battled the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #129-130</ref> She secretly has her own agenda and has no real interest in the group. She battled the Thing in personal combat, and then wound up ultimately switching sides and helping the Fantastic Four defeat the Frightful Four after she quits that group.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #133</ref>

She later battled the [[Hulk]], who was possessing the Thing's body at the time.<ref>''Giant-Size Super-Stars'' #1</ref> Thundra later assisted the Fantastic Four against the Frightful Four again,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #148</ref> and then assisted the Fantastic Four against [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #149</ref> Her time travel from 23rd Century Femizonia, an alternate future ruled by women, to prevent the formation of Machus, an alternate future ruled by men, was finally revealed. Alongside the Fantastic Four, she battled Mahkizmo. She ultimately remained in the 20th Century after a dimensional interface of Femizonia and Machus occurred.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #151-153</ref>  She later assisted the Fantastic Four and [[Tigra]] against the Frightful Four,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #177-178</ref> and then assisted the Fantastic Four, Tigra, and the [[Impossible Man]] against the [[Brute (Reed Richards)|Brute]], [[Mad Thinker]], and [[Annihilus]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #179-183</ref>

Thundra later met wrestling promoter Herkimer Oglethorpe, and on his advice she became a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] training with the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]], a group of female wrestlers who possess [[cybernetics|cybernetic]]-endowed superpowers. In a fixed wrestling match with one Grappler member, Thundra (who has superior strength and fighting skills) is secretly drugged by her opponent, causing her to [[Fainting|black out]] and lose the match.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #53-55</ref>

When she awakens, it was revealed that the Grapplers were actually agents working for the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]], a [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[petroleum]] company which was [[Black Operation|covertly]] involved in developing advanced technology and weaponry for sinister motives. The Grapplers were assigned to trick Thundra into helping them [[sabotage]] [[Project Pegasus]], a prison/research facility built for housing supervillains. They were employed the smuggle the Nth Projector out of Project Pegasus.<ref name="Marvel Two-in-One #56">''Marvel Two-in-One'' #56</ref>

As a result of the deception by Roxxon and the Grapplers, Thundra came to blows (yet again) with the Thing (with whom she has expressed a romantic interest in, on more than one occasion).<ref name="Marvel Two-in-One #56"/> Alongside the Thing, [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]], [[Bill Foster (comics)|Giant-Man]], and the [[Wundarr the Aquarian|Aquarian]], she fought the [[Nth Man]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #58</ref> She encountered the duplicate [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and battled [[Ms. Marvel]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #8</ref> She is briefly allied with the duplicate Hyperion while still in service to Roxxon, and with him stole the Nth Projector from the Nth Command, before she returned to an alternate Femizonia which did not interface with [[Machus]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #67</ref>

Sometime later, Thundra was revealed as the Empress of Femizonia. She teamed with the Thing to battle Machan rebels.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #303</ref> She later abducted the Avengers and Fantastic Four to the future to enlist their aid in defending Femizonia from the extra-dimensional warlord [[Arkon]] and his warriors from Polemachus.  She fought Arkon in personal combat, and became romantically inclined toward him.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #75</ref>

However, Thundra has a special place in her heart for [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]]/the Thing. In addition to her amorous advances, the two have been involved in numerous superheroic adventures; one significant pairing of the two involved enlisting Grimm to help liberate Femizonia from a powerful, six-armed [[android (robot)|android]] sent from Machus to conquer the Femizons. After defeating the android, Grimm informed Thundra that they could never be together, expressing his love for [[Alicia Masters]]. Thundra then allowed him to return to the 20th century.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Secret Invasion: Inhumans===
[[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] infiltrate Thundra's present-day homeland in order to retrieve part of a device required to rescue [[Black Bolt]] from the [[Skrulls]] intent on weaponizing him. As tensions between the two disguised women boil over, Thundra appears and compels them to undertake the ritual combat required of the society to resolve the disagreement. Thundra is convinced to hand over the Skrull intelligence agent after Crystal makes an impassioned speech.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3-4 (2008)</ref>

===Lady Liberators===
Thundra, [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] and [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)#Valkyrie (Samantha Parrington)|Valkyrie]] team up with [[She-Hulk]] and her Skrull partner [[Jazinda]] (masquerading as a [[Shi'ar]]) in order to forcibly distribute stagnating aid in the corrupt country of Marinmer.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol.2 # 34</ref>

===Alliance with the Red Hulk===
The [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] battles the [[Lady Liberators]] and tricks them into believing they caused him to pass out. Red Hulk then kidnaps Thundra, and offers her an alliance after deducing she was the only one of the group that was willing to kill him.<ref>Jeph Loeb. ''Hulk'' vol. 2, #7 - 9 (Dec. 2008 - Feb. 2009)</ref> After agreeing to the alliance, Thundra becomes a subordinate of the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]], a group of genius villains founded by Leader. After Red Hulk is betrayed by the Intelligencia in the "[[Fall of the Hulks]]" storyline, Thundra aids him in his escape and leaves the group.<ref>Loeb, Jeph. ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #14-17 (October - December 2009)</ref> Since her departure from the group, her daughter Lyra has joined their ranks.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Gamma''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of genetic engineering, Thundra has vast [[superhuman strength]] and resistance to physical injury sufficient to allow her to stand toe to toe with the likes of the Thing.  Her speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes are heightened to the peak of natural human capability. She has undergone intensive pain-management training.

Trained as a warrior, with extensive training in the hand-to-hand and military combat techniques of the 23rd Century, she is a seasoned combat veteran who possesses superior fighting skills and is considered to be the greatest warrior among her people. Thundra is also a skilled combatant with a sword or her three-foot linked [[chain weapon|chain]], the latter of which is her [[manriki|weapon of choice]], often attached to a [[bracelet]] on her left [[forearm]].

Perhaps this is due to the Femizonian [[genetic engineering]] that she was subjected to, the source of her [[metahuman|superhuman]] abilities.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #4 (1999)</ref>
