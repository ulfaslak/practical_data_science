'''Scarlet Witch''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], first appearing in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. She is first portrayed as a [[supervillain]] along with her twin brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] as a founding member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. In most depictions, she is portrayed as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]], and, for much of the character's history, was considered the daughter of the mutant [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. Scarlet Witch possesses abilities to alter reality in unspecified ways and is a powerful sorceress. Scarlet Witch is later depicted as a regular member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] superhero team. She also becomes the wife of fellow superhero and teammate [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], with whom she has two sons, [[Speed (comics)|Thomas]] and [[Wiccan (comics)|William]].

The character's in-universe backstory and parentage has been changed more than once. Depicted in the 1970s as the children of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|golden age]] superhero [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] in the 1980s revealed Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver to be the unknown offspring of supervillain [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. Born to Magneto's estranged wife in [[Transia]], Scarlet Witch and her brother are left in the care of their adoptive [[Romani people|Romani]] parents and she is raised as '''Wanda Maximoff''' (later referred to as '''Wanda Frank''' while the Whizzer was considered to be her father). In another retcon in the 2010s, it is revealed that Quicksilver and she are not mutants but were kidnapped and used as subjects of genetic experimentation by the [[High Evolutionary]], then misled to believe Magneto was their father.

Along with starring in two self-titled limited series of her own, the character appears in animated films, television series, arcade and video games as well as other Marvel-related merchandise. Scarlet Witch is portrayed by [[Elizabeth Olsen]] in the films ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Elizabeth Olsen will reprise the role in the upcoming [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' (2021) and the film ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'' (2021).

Lee also wrote the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' comic book, composed by the most prominent heroes of the editorial. He eventually removed all of them, save for [[Captain America]], and replaced them with villains from other comics: the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver from the X-Men, and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] from [[Iron Man]]'s adventures in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]''.

Marvel Comics was nearing bankruptcy in 1996. ''The Avengers'' and other titles were relaunched in a new continuity without mutants and outsourced to the studios of [[Image Comics]] artists. The project was named ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]''. [[Rob Liefeld]] worked with the relaunched ''Avengers'' title, and unexpectedly included the Scarlet Witch in the team. The character is not a mutant in the new continuity, only a sorcerer. Marvel renegotiated the terms of the deal, and Liefeld was replaced with writer [[Walter Simonson]] and penciller [[Michael Ryan (artist)|Michael Ryan]]. The project was a success, boosting the sales of the titles and bringing Marvel Comics out of bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.whiterocketbooks.com/avengers/heroesreborn/heroesreborn.html|title= Avengers: Heroes Reborn|author= Adrian Watts|date= |publisher= White Rocket Entertainment|accessdate= June 16, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170626093707/http://www.whiterocketbooks.com/avengers/heroesreborn/heroesreborn.html|archivedate= June 26, 2017|df= }}</ref> The project ended after a year, and the Avengers were returned to Marvel and relaunched again, by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[George Pérez]]. Pérez designed a new costume, with Romani influences and abundant curly hair. The design was unusually complicated; Pérez commented that he preferred it that way because it was more challenging to draw, but accepted that other artists would find it irksome.<ref>{{cite book |title= Modern Masters Volume 2: George Pérez|last= Nolen-Weathington|first= Eric|date= 2003|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |isbn= 1-893905-25-X |page= 95}}</ref> [[Alan Davis]] stated that when he became the artist on ''The Avengers'', he asked to change the design because it didn't work well with his simpler, less detailed style.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Nolen-Weathington|first1= Eric|title= Modern Masters Volume 1: Alan Davis|date= 2003|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|isbn= 1-893905-19-5 |page= 92}}</ref>

The character played a pivotal role in the ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' storyline and related limited series ''[[House of M]]'', and appeared in the ''[[Young Avengers]]'' follow-up series, ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]''.

Scarlet Witch is a regular character in ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]'' (2012), beginning with issue #1. The [[AXIS (comics)|Axis]] crossover retconned the character's parentage again, revealing that Magneto was not her father after all, doing away with a relationship that had been canon for decades. It also revealed that she was not a mutant, but a common human that received powers with the experiments of the High Evolutionary. This plot twist was published when Marvel and Fox had a legal dispute over the film rights to the character, as Fox has a film license for the X-Men, mutants, and their related characters.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.newsarama.com/22948-did-marvel-comics-just-solve-the-mcu-s-scarlet-witch-quicksilver-father-problem-spoilers.html|title= Did Marvel Comics Just 'Solve' the MCU's Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver Father Problem?|first= Chris|last=  Arrant|date= December 10, 2014|work= Newsarama|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161019174634/http://www.newsarama.com/22948-did-marvel-comics-just-solve-the-mcu-s-scarlet-witch-quicksilver-father-problem-spoilers.html|archivedate= October 19, 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=April 18, 2016}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Magda, the wife of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], escapes from him while pregnant and takes sanctuary at [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], the home of the [[High Evolutionary]]. She gave birth to twins, Wanda and Pietro. The [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder God]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] altered Wanda at birth and gave her the ability to use magic in addition to her mutant abilities, planning to use her as a vessel when her powers reached maturity. Fearing that Magnus would discover the children, Magda leaves the sanctuary and supposedly dies of exposure to the elements. The twins are attended by [[Bova (comics)|Bova]], who soon assists the super-heroine [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]] through labor, but the birth results in a stillborn child and Miss America dies in the process.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Seeking to find her place after all the revelations of her true past, Wanda finds herself working with the ghost of [[Agatha Harkness]] to investigate recent disruptions in magic, and briefly meets the spirit of her biological mother, Natalya Maximoff (Django Maximoff's sister), who was apparently the Scarlet Witch before Wanda.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #3</ref>

When the [[Civil War II|second superhero Civil War]] began, Pietro came to ask Wanda for help but Wanda refused, because she and Pietro disagreed on which side was right—Pietro not liking the idea of profiling people based on what they might do and Wanda feeling that thinking about the future would have prevented many of their more dangerous mistakes in the past. Past precedent made Wanda feel that introducing her powers to a conflict of this nature could make the situation more dangerous (plus she distrusted Tony Stark), and she resented Pietro for trying to tell her what to do as though she was a child, bluntly informing him that his refusal to learn from his mistakes marked him as a sociopath. She invites Pietro to join her in learning more about Natalya Maximoff but he refuses and the two fight. Wanda bests her brother and coldly tells him she never wants to see him again.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #9</ref>

Wanda's search for answers leads her to Serbia where a priest reveals that Natalya, seeking to spare her children of her difficult life as a witch, gave baby Wanda and Pietro to her relatives, Marya and Django Maximoff. When the town came under attack by the [[High Evolutionary]] and his [[Knights of wundagore|Knights of Wundagore]], the priest told him the location of the twins, whom he proceeded to experiment on. Upon discovering this, Natalya pursued the High Evolutionary to [[Transia]] and died fighting to rescue her children. Touched by her sacrifice, the High Evolutionary returned Wanda and Pietro to Django and Marya to raise after he had concluded his experiments.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #11</ref> Discovering that Marya was still alive, Wanda is finally able to thank her aunt for looking after her and her brother when they were younger though she questions why she and Django never told them the truth about Natalya being their real mother. Marya also reveals that, like her mother, Wanda's grandfather was the Scarlet Warlock, leading Wanda to conclude that witches with strong magical bloodlines are associated with complex colors (as opposed to the Red Witch) to protect themselves.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #12</ref> Wanda finally discovers that a manifestation of Chaos is responsible for destroying witchcraft and, joining forces with the spirits of Natalya and Agatha, are able to weaken it enough for Quicksilver (whom Natalya summons at the last moment) to destroy it. Wanda and Pietro reconcile but Natayla sacrifices herself to save magic. Before she dies, she reveals that it was not the High Evolutionary who killed her, but Wanda and Pietro's father.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #14</ref> After this, Wanda re-dedicates herself to being an Avenger, declaring that while she has fixed witchcraft, she still must work on herself but that she is ready to do is alongside her teammates.{{issue|date=May 2019}}

During the "Last Days of Magic" arc, Scarlet Witch later helps Doctor Strange defeat the Empirikul, a science cult focused on destroying magic in every dimension.<ref>''Dr. Strange: Last Days of Magic'' #1</ref>

===Secret Empire===
When Captain America, as a member of Hydra, made his move to take control over the United States as seen in the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Wanda was seen among the members of Hydra's Avengers.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1</ref> It was eventually revealed that Wanda joined other superheroes in Washington, D.C. in trying to stop Hydra, but they ultimately failed, and Wanda was subjected to a power that caused her to lose control of her powers and her mind and was brainwashed into serving Hydra.<ref>''FCBD 2017 #Secret Empire''</ref> During a "dinner" Ultron/Hank Pym was having with members of the Underground, Captain America, and Hydra's Avengers, he revealed that Scarlet Witch is possessed by Chthon.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #4</ref> [[Madame Hydra]] later mentioned to Captain America that Chthon's possession of Scarlet Witch has left her unhinged.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5</ref> During the battle in Washington DC, Scarlet Witch is knocked out by [[Jane Foster (comics)|Thor]], enabling Doctor Strange to make preparations to free her from Chthon's control.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:SteveEnglehart.jpg|thumb|Writer [[Steve Englehart]] first associated the Scarlet Witch's powers with [[witchcraft]].]]
When the Scarlet Witch was first created by Lee and Kirby, her powers were not well defined. She had "hex powers", that could cause random and  unlikely events to take place. This gave creative freedom to the writers, as it actually meant that her powers could be used for any purpose required by the plot.<ref name="tragic"/> Despite the character's name, she had those powers as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and not because of actual witchcraft. Later writers gave her an increased control over her power, so that she could cause specific events and not just random ones. Englehart also made the character explore witchcraft under the tutelage of [[Agatha Harkness]], a trait that was kept by later writers. The effects of her powers are varied but almost always detrimental to opponents, such as causing the artifact the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]] to work against the inter-dimensional warlord [[Dormammu]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve| penciller= [[Bob Brown (comics)|Brown, Bob]]| inker= [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]] and [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]]|story= To the Death!| title= The Avengers|issue= 118 | date= December 1973 | publisher=| page= | panel= }}</ref> forcing the robot [[Ultron]] to short circuit,<ref name="Avengers_161">{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]| penciller= [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]]| inker= [[Pablo Marcos|Marcos, Pablo]] | story= Beware the Ant-Man!| title= The Avengers|issue= 161 | date= July 1977}}</ref> or a gas main underneath the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] to explode.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]| penciller= [[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]| inker= [[Armando Gil|Gil, Armando]]| story= By Friends--Betrayed!|title= The Avengers Annual|issue= 10|date= 1981}}</ref> Scarlet Witch also has the potential to wield magic and later learned that she was destined to serve the role of Nexus Being, a living focal point for the Earth dimension's mystical energy.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' #1-4 (1994)</ref>

Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] redefined Scarlet Witch's powers and maintained that it was, in fact, an ability to manipulate [[chaos magic]], activated due to the demon Chthon changing her mutation at birth into an ability to wield and control magical energy. This was offered as an explanation for her various feats that seemed to go beyond probability alteration, as well as why her hexes almost always have an effect that is favorable to her goals.<ref name="AvengersVol3#10" /> During Busiek's run as well as the subsequent run by [[Geoff Johns]], she was shown to be capable of large-scale spells given enough concentration and time to shape the chaos magic to a specific goal, including the resurrection of [[Wonder Man]].<ref name="AvengersVol3#10"/>

Her powers were retconned in ''Avengers Disassembled'', removing chaos magic and turning them into reality warping. In ''House of M'', this new power was enough to change the whole universe.<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 8 (2005)</ref> Her powers were retconned back to their previous ones in ''The Children's Crusade'', and the previous events attributed to an outside force that had temporarily increased them.<ref name="Avengers: The Children's Crusade"/>

This was again seemingly changed during AvX when she displays being powerful enough to exhibit a degree of resistance to the Phoenix Force and can cause pain to its hosts, such as Cyclops when he tried to stop Hope from going with her.<ref>''A vs X'' #6</ref> This becomes less effective as the Phoenix Force portions are divided among those who have not yet been defeated.{{issue|date=September 2012}} Scarlet Witch is so powerful, in fact, that she is the described as the only thing the Phoenix Five are still afraid of. ''A vs X'' #12 confirmed that her powers involve chaos magic, and stated that she has "Mutant Magic", and the "primal source of her chaos" magic is cosmic.{{issue|date=October 2012}}

In the new ''Scarlet Witch'' comic series, it is confirmed that Wanda was born with the ability to utilize witchcraft and that this has been seen in other women within her family.<ref name= "SW08">''Scarlet Witch (2016) Issue 08''</ref> Wanda also believes that The High Evolutionary genetically altered her, making her more receptive to magical energy.<ref name= "SW08">''Scarlet Witch (2016) Issue 08''</ref>

==Reception==
Though later incarnations took on feminist overtones, the character of Scarlet Witch was not conceived with ideas of female empowerment in mind. At her debut in the 1960s, the readership for superhero comics was assumed to be exclusively male, and the genre was male-dominated in terms of both artist-creators and the characters they invented. The Scarlet Witch was thus envisioned as a token female character with a passive power, and was used mainly for interpersonal relation plots, perhaps to draw female readers who were believed to prefer [[romance comics]].<ref>Zimmerman, pp. 69-71</ref> ''Avengers'' writer Roy Thomas even created a group of female superheroes, the [[Lady Liberators]], in order to mock [[Second-wave feminism]].<ref>Wright, p. 250</ref> In the 1980s, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]] produced a limited Scarlet Witch series that offered a stronger, more independent character with enhanced powers and a family. He lamented that those changes did not stick, and the kids were killed shortly after he ceased writing the character.<ref name="Steve Englehart"/>

[[Don Markstein]]'s Toonpedia asserted: "The Scarlet Witch is unique among superheroes, and not just because she's the only one who wears a wimple. Her super power is unlike any other—she can alter probability so as to cause mishaps for her foes."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.toonopedia.com/scwitch.htm|title= The Scarlet Witch|last= Markstein|first= Don|date= |work= [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/64NTfJTNo?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/scwitch.htm|archivedate= January 1, 2012|url-status=live|accessdate= January 1, 2012|quote= |df= }}</ref>

Marvel licensed the filming rights of the X-Men and related concepts, such as mutants, to Fox. Fox created a [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started their own film franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], focused in the characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the Avengers. The main core of this franchise were the Avengers, both in standalone films and the successful ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' film. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were disputed by both studios. Fox would claim the rights over them because they were both mutants and children of Magneto, the villain of most of their films, and Marvel would claim those rights because the editorial history of the characters in comic books is more associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men. The studios made an agreement so that both of them would use the characters. It was made on the condition that the plots do not make reference to the other studio's properties: the Fox films cannot mention them as members of the Avengers, and the Marvel films cannot mention them as mutants or children of Magneto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|title=Why these two characters are allowed to appear in both the ''X-Men'' and ''Avengers'' movies|first= Kirsten|last= Acuna|website=[[Business Insider]]|date= April 30, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817134937/http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|archivedate= August 17, 2016}}</ref>

The 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', however, did not feature Scarlet Witch.
