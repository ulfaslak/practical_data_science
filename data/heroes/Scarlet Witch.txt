'''Scarlet Witch''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], first appearing in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. She is first portrayed as a [[supervillain]] along with her twin brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] as a founding member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. In most depictions she is portrayed as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]]. Scarlet Witch possesses abilities to alter reality in unspecified ways and is a powerful sorceress. Scarlet Witch is later depicted as a regular member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] superhero team. She also becomes the wife of fellow superhero and teammate [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], with whom she has two sons, [[Speed (comics)|Thomas]] and [[Wiccan (comics)|William]].

The character's in-universe backstory and parentage has been changed more than once.  Depicted in the 1970s as the children of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|golden age]] superhero [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] in the 1980s revealed Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver to be the unknown offspring of supervillain [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Born to Magneto's estranged wife in [[Transia]], Scarlet Witch and her brother are left in the care of their adoptive [[Romani people|Romani]] parents and she is raised as '''Wanda Maximoff''' (later referred to as '''Wanda Frank''' while the Whizzer was considered to be her father). In another retcon in the 2010s, it is revealed that Quicksilver and she are not mutants but were kidnapped and used as subjects of genetic experimentation by the [[High Evolutionary]], then misled to believe Magneto was their father.

Along with starring in two self-titled limited series of her own, the character appears in animated films, television series, arcade and video games as well as other Marvel-related merchandise. Scarlet Witch has been portrayed by [[Elizabeth Olsen]] in the films ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. In 2012, she was the second highest ranked female character (at #12) on [[IGN]]'s list of the "Top 50 Avengers."

Lee also wrote the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' comic book, composed by the most prominent heroes of the editorial. He eventually removed all of them, save for [[Captain America]], and replaced them with villains from other comics: the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver from the X-Men, and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] from [[Iron Man]]'s adventures in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]''.

Marvel Comics was nearing bankruptcy in 1996. ''The Avengers'' and other titles were relaunched in a new continuity without mutants and outsourced to the studios of [[Image Comics]] artists. The project was named ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]''. [[Rob Liefeld]] worked with the relaunched ''Avengers'' title, and unexpectedly included the Scarlet Witch in the team. The character is not a mutant in the new continuity, only a sorcerer. Marvel renegotiated the terms of the deal, and Liefeld was replaced with writer [[Walter Simonson]] and penciller [[Michael Ryan (artist)|Michael Ryan]]. The project was a success, boosting the sales of the titles and bringing Marvel Comics out of bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.whiterocketbooks.com/avengers/heroesreborn/heroesreborn.html|title= Avengers: Heroes Reborn|author= Adrian Watts|date= |publisher= White Rocket Entertainment|accessdate= June 16, 2017|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170626093707/http://www.whiterocketbooks.com/avengers/heroesreborn/heroesreborn.html|archivedate= June 26, 2017|df= }}</ref> The project ended after a year, and the Avengers were returned to Marvel and relaunched again, by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[George Pérez]]. Pérez designed a new costume, with Romani influences and abundant curly hair. The design was unusually complicated; Pérez commented that he preferred it that way because it was more challenging to draw, but accepted that other artists would find it irksome.<ref>{{cite book |title= Modern Masters Volume 2: George Pérez|last= Nolen-Weathington|first= Eric|date= 2003|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |isbn= 1-893905-25-X |page= 95}}</ref> [[Alan Davis]] stated that when he became the artist on ''The Avengers'', he asked to change the design because it didn't work well with his simpler, less detailed style.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Nolen-Weathington|first1= Eric|title= Modern Masters Volume 1: Alan Davis|date= 2003|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|isbn= 1-893905-19-5 |page= 92}}</ref>

The character played a pivotal role in the ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' storyline and related limited series ''[[House of M]]'', and appeared in the ''[[Young Avengers]]'' follow-up series, ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]''.

Scarlet Witch is a regular character in ''[[Uncanny Avengers]]'' (2012), beginning with issue #1. The [[AXIS (comics)|Axis]] crossover retconned the character's parentage again, revealing that Magneto was not her father after all, doing away with a relation that has been canon for decades. It also revealed that she was not a mutant, but a common human that received powers with the experiments of the High Evolutionary. This plot twist was published when Marvel and Fox had a legal dispute over the film rights to the character, as Fox has a film license for the X-Men, mutants, and their related characters.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.newsarama.com/22948-did-marvel-comics-just-solve-the-mcu-s-scarlet-witch-quicksilver-father-problem-spoilers.html|title= Did Marvel Comics Just 'Solve' the MCU's Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver Father Problem?|first= Chris|last=  Arrant|date= December 10, 2014|publisher= Newsarama|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161019174634/http://www.newsarama.com/22948-did-marvel-comics-just-solve-the-mcu-s-scarlet-witch-quicksilver-father-problem-spoilers.html|archivedate= October 19, 2016|deadurl= no|accessdate=April 18, 2016}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Magda, the wife of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], escapes from him while pregnant and takes sanctuary at [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], the home of the [[High Evolutionary]]. She gave birth to twins, Wanda and Pietro. The [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder God]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] altered Wanda at birth and gave her the ability to use magic in addition to her mutant abilities, planning to use her as a vessel when her powers reached maturity. Fearing that Magnus would discover the children, Magda leaves the sanctuary and supposedly dies of exposure to the elements. The twins are attended by [[Bova (comics)|Bova]], who soon assists the super-heroine [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]] through labor, but the birth results in a stillborn child and Miss America dies in the process. Bova tells the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]] (Robert Frank) that the twins are his children, but he flees because of shock from the death of his wife.<ref name="Avengers' 1979">{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Gruenwald|Gruenwald, Mark]], [[Steven Grant|Grant, Steven]], and [[David Michelinie|Michelinie, David]]| penciller= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]| inker= [[Dan Green (artist)|Green, Dan]]| story= The Yesterday Quest!| title= The Avengers|issue= 185| date= July 1979}}<br/>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark, Grant, Steven, and Michelinie, David| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Green, Dan| story= Nights of Wundagore!| title= The Avengers|issue= 186| date= August 1979}}<br/>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark, Grant, Steven, and Michelinie, David| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Green, Dan| story= The Call of the Mountain Thing!| title= The Avengers|issue= 187| date= September 1979}}</ref> The High Evolutionary places them instead in the care of the [[Romani people|Romani]] Django and Marya Maximoff, who raise the twins as their own, naming them Pietro and Wanda.

When the [[Civil War II|second superhero Civil War]] began, Pietro came to ask Wanda for help but Wanda refused, because she and Pietro disagreed on which side was right—Pietro not liking the idea of profiling people based on what they might do and Wanda feeling that thinking about the future would have prevented many of their more dangerous mistakes in the past. Past precedent made Wanda feel that introducing her powers to a conflict of this nature could make the situation more dangerous (plus she distrusted Tony Stark), and she resented Pietro for trying to tell her what to do as though she was a child, bluntly informing him that his refusal to learn from his mistakes marked him as a sociopath.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #9</ref>

During the "Last Days of Magic" arc, Scarlet Witch later helps Doctor Strange defeat the Empirikul, a science cult focused on destroying magic in every dimension.<ref>''Dr. Strange: Last Days of Magic'' #1</ref>

===Secret Empire===

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:SteveEnglehart.jpg|thumb|Writer [[Steve Englehart]] first associated the Scarlet Witch's powers with [[witchcraft]].]]
When the Scarlet Witch was first created by Lee and Kirby, her powers were not well defined. She had "hex powers", that could cause random unlikely events to take place. This gave creative freedom to the writers, as it actually meant that her powers could be used for any purpose required by the plot.<ref name="tragic"/> Despite the character's name, she had those powers as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and not because of actual witchcraft. Later writers gave her an increased control over her power, so that she could cause specific events and not just random ones. Englehart also made the character explore witchcraft under the tutelage of [[Agatha Harkness]], a trait that was kept by later writers. The effects of her powers are varied but almost always detrimental to opponents, such as causing the artifact the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]] to work against the inter-dimensional warlord [[Dormammu]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve| penciller= [[Bob Brown (comics)|Brown, Bob]]| inker= [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]] and [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]]|story= To the Death!| title= The Avengers|issue= 118 | date= December 1973 | publisher=| page= | panel= }}</ref> forcing the robot [[Ultron]] to short circuit,<ref name="Avengers_161">{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]| penciller= [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]]| inker= [[Pablo Marcos|Marcos, Pablo]] | story= Beware the Ant-Man!| title= The Avengers|issue= 161 | date= July 1977}}</ref> or a gas main underneath the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] to explode.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]| penciller= [[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]| inker= [[Armando Gil|Gil, Armando]]| story= By Friends--Betrayed!|title= The Avengers Annual|issue= 10|date= 1981}}</ref> Scarlet Witch also has the potential to wield magic and later learned that she was destined to serve the role of Nexus Being, a living focal point for the Earth dimension's mystical energy.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' #1-4 (1994)</ref>

Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] redefined Scarlet Witch's powers and maintained that it was, in fact, an ability to manipulate [[chaos magic]], activated due to the demon Chthon changing her mutation at birth into an ability to wield and control magical energy. This was offered as an explanation for her various feats that seemed to go beyond probability alteration, as well as why her hexes almost always have an effect that is favorable to her goals.<ref name="AvengersVol3#10" /> During Busiek's run as well as the subsequent run by [[Geoff Johns]], she was shown to be capable of large-scale spells given enough concentration and time to shape the chaos magic to a specific goal, including the resurrection of [[Wonder Man]].<ref name="AvengersVol3#10"/>

Her powers were retconned in ''Avengers Disassembled'', removing chaos magic and turning them into reality warping. In ''House of M'', this new power was enough to change the whole universe.<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 8 (2005)</ref> Her powers were retconned back to their previous ones in ''The Children's Crusade'', and the previous events attributed to an outside force that had temporarily increased them.<ref name="Avengers: The Children's Crusade"/>

She has a degree of resistance to the Phoenix Force and can cause pain to its hosts, such as Cyclops when he tried to stop Hope from going with her.<ref>''A vs X'' #6</ref> This becomes less effective as the Phoenix Force portions are divided among those who have not yet been defeated.{{issue|date=September 2012}} ''A vs X'' #12 confirmed that her powers involve chaos magic, and stated that she has "Mutant Magic", and the "primal source of her chaos" magic is cosmic.{{issue|date=October 2012}}

In the new ''Scarlet Witch'' series (2016), it is confirmed that Wanda was born with the ability to utilize witchcraft and that this has been seen in other women within her family.{{issue|date=August 2016}} Wanda believes that The High Evolutionary genetically altered her, making her more receptive to magical energy.{{issue|date=August 2016}}

==Reception==
Though later incarnations took on feminist overtones, the character of Scarlet Witch was not conceived with ideas of female empowerment in mind. At her debut in the 1960s, the readership for superhero comics was assumed to be exclusively male, and the genre was male-dominated in terms of both artist-creators and the characters they invented. The Scarlet Witch was thus envisioned as a token female character with a passive power, and was used mainly for interpersonal relation plots, perhaps to draw female readers who were believed to prefer [[romance comics]].<ref>Zimmerman, pp. 69-71</ref> ''Avengers'' writer Roy Thomas even created a group of female superheroes, the [[Lady Liberators]], in order to mock [[Second-wave feminism]].<ref>Wright, p. 250</ref> In the 1980's, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]] produced a limited Scarlet Witch series that offered a stronger, more independent character with enhanced powers and a family.

===Film===
[[File:Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.jpg|right|thumb|[[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] (left) as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Elizabeth Olsen]] (right) as Scarlet Witch in the 2015 film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'']]
Marvel licensed the filming rights of the X-Men and related concepts, such as mutants, to Fox. Fox created a [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started their own film franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], focused in the characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the Avengers. The main core of this franchise were the Avengers, both in standalone films and the successful ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' film. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were disputed by both studios. Fox would claim the rights over them because they were both mutants and children of Magneto, the villain of most of their films, and Marvel would claim those rights because the editorial history of the characters in comic books is more associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men. The studios made an agreement so that both of them would use the characters. It was made on the condition that the plots do not make reference to the other studio's properties: the Fox films cannot mention them as members of the Avengers, and the Marvel films cannot mention them as mutants or children of Magneto.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|title= Why these two characters are allowed to appear in both the ''X-Men'' and ''Avengers'' movies|first= Kirsten|last= Acuna|date= April 30, 2015|work= [[Business Insider]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817134937/http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|archivedate= August 17, 2016|deadurl= no|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref>

The 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', however, did not feature Scarlet Witch. There is a brief image of Quicksilver with a small girl in the film, and a deleted scene of Quicksilver complaining about his sister, but the director [[Bryan Singer]] denied that the girl was Scarlet Witch, saying that she was only Quicksilver's little sister, and that it was just a nod for comic book fans.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ''X-Men: Days Of Future Past'' Cuts All Mentions Of Scarlet Witch|url = http://www.cinemablend.com/new/X-Men-Days-Future-Past-Cuts-All-Mentions-Scarlet-Witch-42762.html|first= Gabe|last= Toro|publisher= Cinema Blend|date = April 28, 2014|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222142319/http://www.cinemablend.com/new/X-Men-Days-Future-Past-Cuts-All-Mentions-Scarlet-Witch-42762.html|archivedate= December 22, 2015|deadurl= no|accessdate= October 25, 2015}}</ref> The sequel film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' introduces another daughter of Magneto, Nina, who is also unrelated to the Scarlet Witch.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/x-men-apocalypse-magneto-daughter-2016-6|title= The most tragic scene in 'X-Men: Apocalypse' has an even sadder comic history|author= Sidney Fussell|date= June 1, 2016|publisher= Business Insider|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref>

[[Elizabeth Olsen]] plays Wanda Maximoff in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. The comic book costume was ignored in favor of more everyday clothes.
