'''Jane Foster''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], most commonly depicted as a supporting character of the [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor Odinson]]. Created by writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]], and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #84 (Sept. 1962). For many years, Foster was a [[Nursing|nurse]] employed by Dr. Donald Blake, Thor's first mortal host, before becoming a doctor herself. In a 2014 storyline, Foster is revealed to be deemed worthy to [[wikt:wield|wield]] Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] when the former is no longer able. During this temporary period, she adopts the name '''Thor, the Goddess of Thunder''', and joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. This storyline ends with the character sacrificing her life to defeat a dangerous adversary, and the reverting of the mantle Thor to its original bearer.

Jane Foster has also appeared in various media adaptations of Thor, including the 2011 feature film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' and the 2013 sequel ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', in which she is portrayed by [[Natalie Portman]]. She is also referenced with photos or in dialogue in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), and episodes of the television series ''[[Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''.

==Publication history==
Jane Foster first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #84 (Sept. 1962), and was created by plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]] and [[penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]]. Named "Jane Nelson" in her first two appearances, she went on to appear as the love interest of Dr. Donald Blake, the secret identity of the [[Norse god]] [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], in nearly every issue through #136 (Jan. 1967) of the title, by then renamed ''Thor''.<ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/character/name/jane%20foster/sort/chrono/ "Jane Foster"]. [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref>

In October 2014, the fourth volume of ''Thor'' by Jason Aaron and artist [[Russell Dauterman]] debuted that featured a female character in the role of Thor after the classic hero is no longer able to wield Mjolnir. Aaron stated, "This is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is Thor. This is the Thor of the Marvel Universe. But it’s unlike any Thor we’ve ever seen before."<ref>{{cite web |date=July 15, 2014 |title=Marvel Proudly Presents Thor |url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/22875/marvel_proudly_presents_thor#ixzz37YlHmVqi |publisher=Marvel Comics |accessdate=July 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911024243/http://marvel.com/news/comics/22875/marvel_proudly_presents_thor#ixzz37YlHmVqi |archive-date=2014-09-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> In March 2015, Marvel announced that this Thor will join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''All-New All-Different Avengers'' [[Free Comic Book Day|FCBD]] (May 2015), which takes place in the aftermath of the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline.<ref>{{cite web |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=May 24, 2015 |title=Marvel Begins To Unveil 'All-New All-Different Avengers' |url=http://www.newsarama.com/23888-marvel-begins-to-unveil-all-new-all-different-avengers-title-for-fcbd.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref> In ''Thor'' vol. 4, #8 (May 2015), the identity of the female was revealed to be Jane Foster. Aaron said, "It grew out of the idea of the previous Thor becoming unworthy, which was something I was always building toward. I liked the idea of dealing with his worthiness and the idea of what it means for a god to be worthy in the Marvel universe. You know, the god of thunder waking up every morning and looking at the hammer and not knowing if he’s gonna be worthy to lift it. Then, of course, one day he should wake up and not be able to lift it. That opened the door for someone else to pick up the hammer and carry it around in his place.

==Fictional character history==
===Early history===
Jane Nelson, known by her more common name of Jane Foster, was a nurse for Dr. Donald Blake, eventually developing feelings for him and Thor, not knowing that they were one and the same. The love triangle went on for a while until Thor revealed his secret identity to Foster, which caused [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] to punish him though he was forgiven after saving Asgard, and in return Thor even took her to Asgard with him.<ref>''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #125 (Feb. 1966). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> There, Foster was briefly granted immortality and the power of gods, until she failed to pass the tests of courage set forth by Odin when she showed fear battling the monstrous Unknown. Odin then strips Foster of her new powers and returns her to Earth, with no memory of Thor or her time in Asgard, where she meets her new love Dr. Keith Kincaid, who resembles Blake. Meanwhile, in Asgard Odin reunites Thor with his childhood love, [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]].<ref>''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #136 (Jan. 1967). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

===Return===

===Becoming Thor===
[[File:Cover of Thor 4-1.jpg|thumb|right|''Thor'' vol. 4, #1 (Oct. 2014): Jane Foster as Thor. Cover art by [[Russell Dauterman]] and Frank Martin.]]
During the 2014 "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]" storyline, [[Nick Fury]] whispers an unrevealed secret to Thor that causes him to lose the ability to wield Mjolnir.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Aaron, Jason|artist=Deodato|colorist= |letterer= |editor= |title=[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]|issue= 7|date=August 2014}}</ref> Soon afterwards, an unidentified woman picks up the hammer, taking possession of Thor's power as the new Goddess of Thunder, and fights [[Malekith the Accursed]], Dario Agger (the new [[Minotaur (comics)|Minotaur]]), and the [[Absorbing Man]]. Although Thor initially attempts to reclaim the hammer,<ref>''Thor'' vol.4, #4. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> he – referring to himself as 'Odinson' – relinquishes the name and role of Thor after witnessing her wield its power.<ref name="Thor vol. 4, #5">''Thor'' vol. 4, #5. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Odinson suspects Foster as a possible candidate for his successor,<ref name="Thor vol. 4, #5"/> but he soon dismisses her due to her weakened condition from chemotherapy.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 4, #6. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Angered that someone else is wielding Mjolnir, Odin and his brother [[Serpent (comics)|Cul]], the God of Fear, send the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] after the new Thor to retrieve the hammer but Odinson and Freyja assemble an army of female superheroes to aid her.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 4, #7</ref> When the battle is over, Odinson asks Thor to reveal her face but is interrupted by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Roz Solomon, Odinson's last 'viable' suspect as the new Thor after all other possible candidates came to assist in the battle. Unbeknownst to Odinson, Mjolnir has given Jane the strength to fight as Thor while it is in her possession.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 4, #8</ref> However, Jane's use of Mjolnir has perpetuated her cancer as a result of the transformation process purging all toxins from her body, including the radiation being used for her treatment, each time she transforms.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2, #1. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Foster appeared in the [[Marvel Original Graphic Novel|original graphic novel]] ''Avengers: Rage of Ultron'' as a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers: Rage of Ultron'' #1. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

The concept of Jane Foster gaining the powers of Thor had previously been explored in ''What If'' #10 (August 1978).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/198981-174531-jane-foster.jpg |title=Photo |website=static.comicvine.com |format=JPG}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jane-foster/4005-12337/|title=Jane Foster (Character) - Comic Vine|website=Comic Vine}}</ref>

===Secret Wars===
During the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, Foster was a participant in the final battle between [[Earth-616]] and [[Ultimate Marvel|Earth-1610]] during its collision during the incursion event. She is one of the few survivors of the end of the extant Marvel Universe, boarding [[Reed Richards]]'s "life raft".<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> She and the other survivors are awakened eight years later, having been trapped in suspended animation.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the interim, [[Doctor Doom]] created a new universe, [[Battleworld]], from the fragments of dead universes. Knowing the survivors represent the only hope of defeating Doom, [[Doctor Strange]] scatters Foster and the others to different parts of Battleworld. For this, Doom kills Strange and begins hunting the survivors.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #4</ref> Foster infiltrated the Thor Corps, Doom's police force, and convinced a majority of them to revolt against Doom.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===All-New All-Different Marvel===
In the 2015-18 [[All-New All-Different Marvel]] branding, Foster remains in Asgardia as a representative of Midgard (Earth) in the Congress of Worlds, and as Thor, she remains a fugitive pursued by Cul. Odinson is considered missing. She became involved in the war between [[Svartalfheim]], the realm of the Dark Elves, and [[Alfheim]], the realm of the Light Elves and encountered several incarnations of Loki. After the elf races struck a deal by wedding their respective monarchs, Thor returned to Asgard to confront the power-mad Odin, who had Freyja on trial. Loki and Thor arrived at the point when The All-Mother was about to be placed on a verdict by Odin. The rebellious Asgardian warriors also made their way into the hall fighting Cul Borson's thunderguard. Thor and Odin got into a crunching battle that wandered across Saturn's moons while it was revealed that Loki was a spy for Freyja. Loki then stabs Freyja halting the battles at hand. Meanwhile, in a different location entirely, Odinson is held captive telepathically feeling the death of his mother.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 5 #1-5</ref> Later, after returning to Earth, Jane is taken into custody by two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who suspected of her double life as Thor until she's bailed out by Agent Solomon. She goes to [[Switzerland]] where she meets Agent Solomon and accompanies her to the Southern Ocean to find a hidden station that belongs to Roxxon. They find the station underwater where Thor encounters Shingen Harada, the second [[Silver Samurai]], who had invaded the station. After being defeated, Shingen escapes from the station, leaving Thor and Agent Solomon to drown. Thor manages to lift the station to the surface while Solomon interrogated the employees about the location of Dario Agger and his contingency plan known as the Agger Imperative. Upon entering Roxxon Corporation HQ, Thor battles the Mindless Ones and the B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R.S., a group of Hulk-like superhumans, while Solomon looked for Dario. During the fight, Thor is approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. who order her to surrender, apparently discovering her civilian identity. Upon holding off the S.H.I.E.L.D. squad, Thor finds Solomon wounded from her fight with Exterminatrix and attacks her and Minotaur with her lightning. When Exterminatrix was about to shoot at Dario with a golden bullet, Thor caught it in mid-air, only for her to get affected by the bullet's gold turning effect. When S.H.I.E.L.D. was about to arrest them, a portal appeared revealing Jane Foster coming to help Thor. While Jane removes the gold bullet from Thor, the Agger Imperative is activated causing the island where the building is to fall from the sky. While S.H.I.E.L.D. evacuates the building, Thor defeats Silver Samurai and Exterminatrix and destroys the island. While the villains are arrested, the two agents who tried to arrest Jane apologize to her and Thor. Thor then reveals to Solomon that the other Jane is an illusion created by Mjolnir and her secret identity as well. After promising to keep the secret safe, Solomon asks Jane about the hammer until Jane disappears when she grabs Mjolnir and gets struck by lightning.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 5 #8-11</ref>

===All-New All-Different Avengers===
Thor is also once again a member of the Avengers and appears in ''All-New All-Different Avengers''. She appeared by chance in their encounter with Warbringer and subsequently agrees to help form a new official Avengers group.<ref>''All-New All-Different Avengers'' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her identity is unknown to her teammates until she is separated from the hammer when she is transferred a few days into the future by [[Kang the Conqueror]], and [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], the new [[Captain America]], witnesses her as she reverts to Jane.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> He agrees to keep it secret, and offers her moral support during chemotherapy treatments.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While treating mystical tumors in his former patients created by Misery, a manifestation of his own darkness, [[Doctor Strange]] calls on Thor for assistance; fully aware of her true identity as Jane Foster, Strange guides Thor in performing the necessary operations to remove the tumors from his patients after they had defeated the manifestation of Misery itself.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' (vol.4) #18. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

Eventually, Jane's cancer reaches a point where she must confess her identity to Thor and others, who force her to stay in a hospital under observation by Doctor Strange despite the threat of [[Mangog]] attacking Asgard, as Strange determines that one more transformation into Thor will kill Jane as the cancer spreads too far.<ref>''Mighty Thor'' #703. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> However, when Mangog proves too powerful, Jane transforms back into Thor and confronts him,<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #704. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> sacrificing Mjolnir – and thus her life – by binding Mangog and Mjolnir together with Gleipnir, the chain used to trap Fenris the wolf, and hurling both into the Sun. Knowing that she will die once the enchantment that turns her into Thor wears off, Jane kisses Odinson for a final time before expiring.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #705. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Consumed by grief of Jane Foster's loss, Odinson works to revive her as Jane Foster hesitates at the gates of Valhalla. Upon Jane gaining his respect, Odin channels the powers of the God Tempest and assists Odinson into resurrecting Jane. In the aftermath of Mangog's defeat, Mjolnir is destroyed, but it is discovered after Foster hands Odinson an uru shard that he is now capable of wielding the metal again. Jane convinces Odinson to reclaim his name and continue in the War Between the Realms as the true Thor while she resolves to focus on her chemotherapy.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #706. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
When wielding Mjolnir, Foster gains all the powers of Thor, including superhuman strength, speed, stamina and durability, flight, and control over lightning.

Foster, however, demonstrates a form of control over Mjolnir that her predecessors lacked, such as changing its trajectory and velocity in mid-throw, and spinning it around her enemies to trap them, abilities neither the original Thor nor any of those aside from Jane had ever displayed.<ref name="Thor vol. 4, #5"/>

==Other versions==
===Marvel 1985===
In ''[[Marvel 1985]]'' #6 (2008), Jane Foster is the attending nurse present when Jerry Goodman wakes from his coma. He asks her on a date, and she accepts. Jerry has had a crush on Jane since reading ''Thor'' comics as a child.<ref>''Marvel 1985'' #6. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

==="Secret Wars"===
In the ''[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars: Thors]]'' miniseries, after various alternate Earths are merged into [[Battleworld]], the various alternate Thors are recruited to police the resulting zones. During their activities, they find themselves investigating the strange deaths of at least six women from different zones, all killed in such a manner as to make identification impossible. With his last act, after being murdered by an unknown assailant, [[Beta Ray Bill]] identifies the victims as Jane Foster. The Thors' subsequent investigation- including analysing samples taken from a Jane who died of cancer a few months before the other murders- confirm that the victims are all Janes, but they are unable to track down any living version of her, apart from learning that 'Thor the Unworthy' - the Earth-616 Thor who lost possession of Mjolnir - is interfering in attempts to find her.<ref>''Secret Wars: Thors'' #2</ref> After interrogating Loki as a witness, the Ultimate Thor learns that the Janes are being murdered by Rune Thor and Destroyer Thor because they looked the Janes in the eyes and saw how far they had fallen from what they could be. The Thors are subsequently rallied to oppose Doom by the Jane Foster of Earth-616 - currently Thor and one of the few survivors of the Incursions - while Rune Thor is rendered unworthy as Jane forces him to acknowledge the truth about his actions.<ref>''Secret Wars: Thors'' #4</ref>

===Thor: The Mighty Avenger===
In this all-ages "non-[[Comics vocabulary#Continuity|continuity]]" comic published in 2010 and 2011, Jane Foster is the newly promoted head of the department of Nordic Antiquities at the Bergen War Memorial Museum in Bergen, Oklahoma. She first encounters Thor when he attempts to smash one of the museum's exhibit cases (which is later revealed to contain an urn inside which Thor's hammer is concealed). Over the course of the title's eight issues Jane and Thor (who has been exiled from Asgard by Odin and is staying at Jane's apartment) become romantically involved and have a variety of adventures together.{{issue|date=February 2016}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
Jane briefly appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint during the first series of [[Ultimates]], where she was a member of an anarchist cult who believed [[Ultimate Thor|Thorlief Golmen]] was the genuine god of thunder. She was also described as a nurse from [[San Francisco]].<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> In later events, it seems she and Thor live in a flat together.<ref>''Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''What If?''===
In ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' #10 (Aug. 1978) titled "What If Jane Foster Had Found the Hammer of Thor", Jane assumes Donald Blake's place in finding Mjolnir and is imbued with Thor's powers. Calling herself Thordis, she used her powers to rescue Donald Blake from danger. Upon saving Asgard from Ragnarok, Odin forces her to relinquish the hammer to Donald Blake so he can become the new Thor. This resulted in Jane losing her powers, but she was allowed to remain on Asgard and keep her goddess status since she later falls in love with and marries Odin.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Beard |url=http://marvel.com/news/moviestories.14098.essential_thor~colon~_jane_foster |title=Essential Thor: Jane Foster |date=September 23, 2010 |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=September 30, 2010 }}</ref>

In ''What If?'' #25 (Feb. 1980), titled "What If Thor Fought Odin over Jane Foster" (also known as "What If Thor Fought the Asgardian Gods"), Thor is banished from Asgard along with Jane when Thor refused to accept Odin's judgment following Jane's failure to ascend to godhood. Thor subsequently leads the Avengers against the forces of Asgard, leaving [[Iron Man]] and Loki (who once again attempted to seize rulership of Asgard during the conflict) dead and forcing Thor himself into self-imposed banishment for almost destroying Asgard in his selfishness.<ref>''What If?'' #25 (Feb. 1980)</ref>
