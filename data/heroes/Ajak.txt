Ajak received an entry in the original ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #1, and in the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition'' #10.

==Fictional character biography==
Ajak is a member of the sub-race of Eternals known as the Polar Eternals, born in the area of Polaria, [[Siberia]] to parents Raka and Amaa, with a brother named Arex, both as adults being archeologists with advanced knowledge of archeology.

Ajak fought [[Kro (comics)|Warlord Kro]]'s [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] forces in [[Babylon]] 2500 years ago, also maintaining a strong presence in Central America, where they were both worshipped as gods; Ajak by [[Aztec]]s as the god [[Quetzalcoatl]] and by the [[Inca]]s as [[Tecumotzin]], Lord of Flight. Ajak once met the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[deity|god]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and fought alongside him against [[Dromedan]]. During the Third Host of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], Ajak acted as a liaison between the Celestials and Earth and was present in Peru when they arrived.<ref>as revealed in ''Thor Annual'' #7</ref> With [[Zuras]], Ajak arranged the flight plan the Celestials used to leave Earth,{{issue|date=August 2019}} before both placed themselves into storage as atoms within the City of the Space Gods, to await their eventual return.{{issue|date=August 2019}}

Under Zuras' order, [[Ikaris]] awoke Ajak when the Fourth Host of the Celestials arrived.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #2</ref>  Ajak befriended human archaeologist Dr. [[Daniel Damian]], and let him live in the City of the Space Gods. Ajak was sealed with Doctor Damian behind the force barrier surrounding the site of the Fourth Host's arrival.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #3</ref> Ajak was attacked by agents of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who were converted to stored atoms by the Celestials after their failed escape attempt,<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #7</ref> and was known for battling an Incan wrestler.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #12</ref>

Ajak then had another encounter with Thor at the Fourth Host site in Peru.<ref>''Thor'' #284</ref> This time Ajak opposed him, but Thor won their battle. Ultimately, Ajak battled [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] on the behalf of his fellow Eternals, who merely saw the Eternals as the Celestials' pawns.{{issue|date=July 2019}} He was later among the Eternals captured by [[Brother Tode]], who were later set free by [[Iron Man]].{{Issue|date=July 2019}} Ajak joined the space-faring Eternals [[Uni-Mind]],<ref>''Avengers'' #248</ref> later returning to Earth.{{issue|date=July 2019}} A maddened Dr. Damian transformed Ajak into a monster through the use of Celestial technology, sending them to kill [[Thena]] and [[Kro (comics)|Kro]]'s twin children, [[Donald & Deborah Ritter]]. The monstrous Ajak killed many sets of twins along the way. After the Eternals restored Ajak to their true form, suddenly grief-stricken with the deeds that committed as a monster, Ajak committed [[suicide]], additionally disintegrating Dr. Damian himself.{{Issue|date=July 2019}}

[[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]] states that sometime later he used the machineries of [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]] to partially "reactivate" Ajak and [[Zuras]] — and then deceived them into visiting the tomb of the [[Dreaming Celestial]], forming a [[Uni-Mind]] there. This provided Sprite with the power needed to rewrite some aspects of reality, stripping the other Eternals of their powers and memories and removing all records of them from the world. Sprite also stated that Ajak is the only Eternal able to directly speak with the Celestials.{{issue|date=July 2019}} Ajak appeared, seemingly in a normal state, and revived Zuras to their own normal state.<ref>''Eternals'' #1-5 (2006)</ref> 

===''Secret Invasion''===
Ajak left to join [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]' "[[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]]" to battle the [[Skrull]] gods—not only to defend Earth, but, due to the Skrulls, in fact, being Deviants (as their native people were also transformed by the Celestials, but the Deviants won their war), which he believes will allow a greater understanding of the Celestials, and perhaps the means to communicate with the Dreaming Celestial (whom only Makkari can communicate with).<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #117 (July 2008)</ref> Thinking Hercules to be a bad leader, Ajak takes command of the God Squad from him just before they battle the Skrull Gods, causing Snowbird's death due to a lack of planning.{{Issue|date=July 2019}} Ajak is subsequently killed in the confrontation with the Skrull God [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kly'bn|Kly'bn]].<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #120 (August 2008)</ref>

===Post-''Secret Invasion''===
Later, a revived Ajak along with the other Eternals continue their mission of awakening Eternals who no longer remember who they are and are living human lives, thanks to Sprite. During this time Ajak breeds resentment towards Makkari for being the Dreaming Celestial's chosen communicator, warning the other Eternals that the Dreaming Celestial is broken. While Ikaris and Druig's opposing forces race to awaken and convert as many "sleeping" Eternals as they can to their respective sides, Ajak locates the Eternal known as Gilgamesh, "The Forgotten One", in Peru, manipulating them into believing Ikaris' Eternals are actually Deviants. Ajak does not do this out of loyalty to Druig, but out of resentment towards Makkari; Gilgamesh ends up brutally killing Makkari, which Druig and Legba witness. Ajak then goes to Makkari's side and signals Sersi, telling her that it was Druig and his forces that killed Makkari. Ajak then continues to monitor the Dreaming Celestial while Ikaris and Druig's forces go to battle.{{issue|date=July 2019}}

Sometime during these events, Ajak helps the Eternals battle the Young Gods, who have returned from the Celestial's ship. Ajak mainly watches the battle from Olympia, reveling in the Young Gods' defeat of Makkari, but when Makkari is about to be killed, Ajak chooses to intervene, believing even an Eternal such as Makkari deserves better than death at the hands of "these blasphemers." It is assumed Ajak has gone back to monitoring the Dreaming Celestial.{{issue|date=July 2019}}

==Powers and abilities==
Ajak possessed the standard Eternal abilities of cosmic energy manipulation and complete control of one's own cellular makeup. The physical control granted gives Eternals an indefinitely prolonged lifespan and cellular regeneration along with superhuman strength and durability, in addition to cosmic powers granting them flight, teleportation and the ability to fire energy bolts.

It was also revealed in Gaiman's miniseries ''Eternals'' that Ajak possesses the ability to directly communicate with the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] when they are nearby.
