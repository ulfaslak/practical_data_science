'''Ant-Man''' ('''Scott Lang''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], Scott Lang first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #181 (March 1979) and in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #47 (April 1979) as the second superhero character to use the [[Ant-Man]] name in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He is a reformed thief and an electronics expert. He was a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], a featured character in the comic-book series ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'', and in 2015 became the title character in the series ''Ant-Man''.

Scott Lang is an ex-convict and electronics expert hired by [[Stark International]], which enables him to steal the Ant-Man suit from [[Hank Pym]], who had long since given up the name, to help his sick daughter. When Pym finds out, he gives the suit to Lang, allowing him to become the second Ant-Man. As Ant-Man he serves as an Avenger for years, until he is killed during the ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' storyline. Years later he is resurrected in the ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]'' mini series. Following his resurrection, Lang briefly heads the [[Future Foundation]].

[[Paul Rudd]] portrays Scott Lang in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] with the films ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'', ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', and will reprise the role in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref>{{Cite Web|url=https://screenrant.com/robert-downey-jr-avengers-4/|title=Robert Downey Jr Avengers| date = May 2, 2018}}</ref>

==Publication history==
Created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]],{{sfn|Rivera|2015}} Scott Lang first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #181 ([[cover-date]]d March 1979) and as the second Ant-Man in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #47 (April 1979).{{sfn|Lovette|2015}} Michelinie had long been an enthusiast of shrinking heroes, and saw Hank Pym's return to the [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]] guise as an opportunity to take over the discarded Ant-Man identity.<ref name="back71">{{cite journal |last=Brennaman|first=Chris |title=Marvel Premiere|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=29|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> He explained how he came up with the character: {{quote|I wanted something completely different, in both origin and motivation, from Pym. So I came up with the idea of a reformed criminal - not an unjustly accused innocent, which would have been the expected angle. And I figured that, as a burglar, he probably enjoyed the adrenaline rush of his previous 'job,' so the excitement of heroic adventure could fill that need in him, but legally.<ref name="back71"/>}}

Though Ant-Man's two-issue tryout in ''Marvel Premiere'' failed to garner the character his own series, the dynamic of a single father and reformed criminal in the superhero role struck a chord with readers and led to Ant-Man enjoying modest popularity and frequent appearances in Marvel Comics thereafter.<ref name="back71"/>

Ant-Man appeared prominently in the 2012's ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' series by [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Mike Allred]].{{sfn|Beard|2012}}

An ongoing series focusing on Lang, titled simply ''Ant-Man'' written by [[Nick Spencer]] and drawn by [[:ca:Ramon Rosanas|Ramon Rosanas]], began in January 2015.{{sfn|Beard|2014}} After Marvel's Secret Wars event, the series continued with the title ''Astonishing Ant-Man.''

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Scott Edward Harris Lang was born in [[Coral Gables, Florida]].{{sfn|Truitt|2015}} A movie fanatic, he turned to burglary when his occupation as an electrical engineer failed to  provide him with enough excitement in life.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #47 (April 1979); ''Avengers'' #195 (May 1980)</ref> (This was later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] with the statement that he did so because he couldn't support his family.{{sfn|Rivera|2015}}) Apprehended, Lang served his prison sentence and was paroled after four years for good behavior. In prison, he furthered his study of electronics and was soon hired by [[Stark International]] to work in its design department. Under Tony Stark's direction, he helped install a new security system in [[Avengers Mansion]].<ref>''Avengers'' #181</ref>

===The second Ant-Man===
[[File:Marvel Premiere 47 Scott Lang.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #47 (April 1979). Art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].]]
When his daughter [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie]] became seriously ill, Scott Lang sought out Dr. Erica Sondheim, the only person capable of helping her. However, at the very moment he attempted to contact her, Sondheim was forcibly taken away to [[Cross Technological Enterprises]], and in order to get her out, he decided to return to burglary as a final resort.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #47</ref> He broke into [[Hank Pym|Dr. Hank Pym]]'s home and stole the Ant-Man suit and shrinking gas canisters.{{sfn|Enk|2014}} Garbed as Ant-Man, Lang broke into Cross Enterprises and discovered that Sondheim was being held prisoner by [[Darren Cross]]. He rescued the doctor from Cross' clutches and was relieved when Sondheim was able to save his beloved Cassie's life. Upon being confronted by Pym (as [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]]), Lang intended to return the Ant-Man suit to Pym and turn himself in for its theft, but Pym, aware of the use to which Lang had put the stolen goods, offered to let him keep them, provided he only use them to uphold the law.<ref name="MarvelPr47-48">''Marvel Premiere'' #47-48</ref>

===Hero===
Shortly after, Scott Lang donned the Ant-Man costume on various occasions, primarily to assist [[Iron Man]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Scott came to the rescue when Iron Man was trapped in his armor in the aftermath of a system overload.<ref name="IronMan133">''Iron Man'' #133</ref> He also helped Yellowjacket (Hank Pym's alias at the time) attempt to rescue the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] captured by Dr. Parnell Solomon, and alongside the Avengers he first battled [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]].<ref>''Avengers'' #195-196</ref> He then battled Odd John's mutated insects, and encountered Biotron of the [[Micronauts (comic book)|Micronauts]].<ref>''Micronauts'' Vol. 1 #19-20</ref> Alongside [[Spider-Man]], he again battled Taskmaster, exploiting Taskmaster's belief that he was Pym by using his growth capsules on one of his ants as a surprise tactic.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #103</ref> As Lang, he attempted to stop the [[Raiders (comics)|Raiders]] at a Dallas electronics engineers convention.<ref>''Iron Man'' #145</ref> He then battled the malfunctioning GARD computer security system at ''Stark International''.<ref>''Iron Man'' #151</ref> As Lang, he aided Iron Man and [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]] against [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #156</ref> He then met the [[Fantastic Four]], and on their behalf first journeyed to a "micro-world", and joined the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in battle against its denizens.<ref name="MTiO87">''Marvel Two-in-One'' #87</ref>

Scott was instrumental in helping Iron Man discover who possessed copies of his technology during the ''[[Armor Wars]]'' storyline.<ref>''Iron Man'' #225</ref> He also aided the Avengers in infiltrating Taskmaster's henchmen-training facility, battling the Taskmaster alongside [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and visited Henry Pym while he was in prison.<ref>''Avengers'' #223-224</ref> He encountered [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and [[Alpha Flight]], and then battled [[Dire Wraith]]s alongside [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] and [[Starshine (comics)#Brandy Clark|Starshine]].<ref>''Rom'' #58-59</ref> Scott was serving in an Avengers back-up team created when [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil]] took control of the Mansion and captured some of the current team; he even helped the Wasp defeat the [[Absorbing Man]] and [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]] when they attacked a hospital in an attempt to kill a comatose [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>''Avengers'' #275-277</ref> He accidentally shrank Spider-Man and battled the Scarlet Beetle.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #24</ref> He also battled [[Dragonfly (Marvel Comics)|Dragonfly]].<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #12</ref>

Lang was briefly hired by the [[Fantastic Four]] to serve as their technical consultant when Reed Richards was missing and presumed dead.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #384</ref> It was during this period that Lang learned that Cassie had long since found out about his double life as a superhero.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol.1 #405 (October 1995)</ref> Lang later returned to form a temporary Fantastic Four with the [[Human Torch]], [[She-Hulk]] and [[Namorita]] when the other three were temporarily trapped in the [[Negative Zone]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3 #43</ref>

Lang played an important role in helping [[Mister Fantastic]] cure the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], who was suffering from [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's disease]]; using a cure devised by [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], Lang shrank down to microscopic size, entered Hulk's genes, and replaced the damaged genes causing the disease with healthy genes taken from the corpse of Bruce Banner's [[Brian Banner|father]], the energy surge released when Hulk returned to human form integrating the new genes into Hulk's system and curing of the disease.<ref>{{Cite comic

After his ex-wife Peggy Rae gained custody of their daughter, Lang accepted an offer to join the Avengers officially.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #62</ref> His personality clashed immediately with fellow Avenger [[Jack of Hearts]]. However, in ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #76, Jack helped save Cassie from a child-murderer, shortly before committing suicide by traveling into space with the murderer and exploding rather than return to the containment cells required to control his power.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #76</ref>

He also appeared in the series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' by [[Brian Michael Bendis]], where he dated the leading character [[Jessica Jones]], a former costumed superhero named Jewel who left that [[avocation]] to become a private investigator.<ref name="Alias #13-28">''Alias'' #13-28</ref>

He assists her in a matter with [[Mattie Franklin]], one of the many female heroes to take the [[Spider-Woman]] name.

==="Death"===
When [[Jack of Hearts]] reappears on the grounds of Avengers Mansion in a zombified state, Scott Lang rushes to Jack, only for Jack to blow himself up, destroying much of the mansion and seemingly killing Scott. This Jack may have been some type of "apparition" created by an insane [[Scarlet Witch]] rather than the actual Jack of Hearts, starting the crisis known as ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]''.<ref>''Avengers'' #500</ref>

His daughter Cassie Lang subsequently takes the name Stature as a member of the [[Young Avengers]], having apparently taken enough Pym particles over the years to enable Cassie to automatically grow and shrink in size whenever she wants.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #2</ref>

His Ant-Man helmet falls into [[Amadeus Cho]]'s possession for a time with Cassie's blessing, choosing to focus on the insect mind-controlling abilities.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #25</ref>

===Return===
During the events of the limited series ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]'', [[Iron Lad]] takes the Young Avengers and an amnesiac Wanda Maximoff into the past, back to the day that the events of ''Avengers Disassembled'' began. Here, despite Iron Lad's assurance that they could not interact, Scott Lang is hugged by his daughter, and to take him away from the zombified Jack of Hearts who is revealed to be the real Jack of Hearts under the control of an insane Scarlet Witch. When Jack explodes, the Scarlet Witch regains her memories and returns them to the present, including Scott (thus his death is [[retconned]] as having never actually happened, as he was merely taken from his time and brought forward).<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #5</ref> Scott is proud that his daughter followed in his footsteps.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #6</ref> However, a subsequent battle ensues (regarding the fate of the Scarlet Witch) involving the Avengers, Young Avengers, [[X-Men]], [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]] and Doctor Doom. In the course of the fight, Scott is seemingly killed by Doom, although he actually survives relatively unscathed; enraged, Cassie attacks but Doom kills her, much to Scott's grief.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #7</ref>

Afterwards, Scott joins the new Defenders team composed of [[Doctor Strange]], [[Silver Surfer]], [[Namor]], [[Betty Ross|Red She-Hulk]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>''Defenders'' vol 4 #10 (September 2012)</ref> Eventually, he became the second [[Future Foundation]]'s leader replacing Reed Richards when the [[Fantastic Four]] went on a time travel trip.<ref>''FF'' #1 (November 2012)</ref> Still suffering from his daughter's death, he decided to aim all the Foundation's resources towards making Doctor Doom pay for his crime; in the meantime he engaged in a romantic relationship with Darla Deering, aka Ms. Thing.<ref>''FF'' Vol. 2</ref>

After a heated battle, Scott managed to exact his revenge on Doctor Doom by gradually overwhelming and defeating him, and by having him believe he had killed [[Valeria Richards]]. He also determined the true meaning of Pym Particles, and how they operate on three distinct axes determining size, strength and durability.<ref>''FF'' (vol 2) #16</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, a now-heroic and repentant Doctor Doom used Scarlet Witch's powers to resurrect Cassandra Lang, seeking to atone for at least one of his crimes; she turned out alive and well on Scott's doorstep.<ref>''Avengers World'' #16</ref>

Following this, Lang moved to Miami to start a new life as well as to spend more time with his daughter.<ref>''Ant-Man'' vol. 2 #1</ref> Scott later established Ant-Man Security Solutions. When he was attacked by [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], mistaking him for [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Eric O'Grady]] unaware of the latter's death, Scott had to clear up the misunderstanding. Afterwards, Scott offered Grizzly a job in the company.<ref>''Ant-Man'' vol. 2 #2</ref> When Cassie was kidnapped by [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] on behalf of Augustine Cross to use Cassie's Pym-particle irradiated heart could revive the very first villain Scott had fought, Scott was forced to turn to Grizzly and his fellow supervillain [[Machinesmith]] to infiltrate Cross' plant to save his daughter. With Machinesmith disabling all the security Scott was able to get into Cross Technologies and fight his way to Darren Cross, whom Dr. Sondheim was blackmailed into reviving using Cassie's heart.<ref>''Ant-Man'' vol. 2 #3-4</ref> Darren engaged in combat against Ant-Man while the hero tried to buy time for Sondheim to transplant another heart into Cassie. After Cross was forced to flee when the Pym Particles now in his body caused him to shrink down, Scott shrank down to microscopic size, and was guided by Sondheim to attack Cassie's white cells and allow her body accept the new heart's tissue. Even though the procedure was difficult, Scott was finally able to help Cassie survive the experience. When Peggy and Blake arrived, Sondheim told her that Cassie suffered an infraction and Scott took them to her. Although he saved his daughter, Scott decided to distance himself from her so that she could have a normal life.<ref>''Ant-Man'' vol. 2 #5</ref>

Some months ago, Ant-Man helped Giant-Man into rescuing a computer technician named Raz Malhotra from Egghead. Months later after the incident where Hank Pym and Ultron were fused together with Pym seemingly perishing as a result of the fusion, Scott received one of Pym's labs. Recalling his encounter with Raz, Scott sent Raz a present in the form of the Giant-Man suit.<ref>''Ant-Man Annual'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

During the "Last Days" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Ant-Man recovers an unnamed Asgardian artifact from [[Slug (comics)|Slug]] which he won from [[List of Marvel Comics characters: M#Miss Patriot|Mary Morgan]] in a game of contact bridge. Ant-Man delivers the goods to Mary Morgan where he learns that she is Miss Patriot. Mary Morgan revealed that Valhalla Villas is a retirement home for Golden Age heroes and villains where they live out their days in blissful remembrance. Mary Morgan then assembles the residents of Valhalla Villas like [[Golden Girl (Timely Comics)|Golden Girl]], Doctor Fear, [[Thunderer (Marvel Comics)|Thunderer]], Leopard Girl, [[Human Top (David Mitchell)|Human Top]], [[Sun Girl (Marvel Comics)|Sun Girl]], [[American Ace]], Flash Foster, and Wax Master. Using the Asgardian artifact, Mary Morgan rejuvenated the Valhalla Villa residents as Miami sees the unexpected resurgence of characters from the Golden Age. Mary decides to remain elderly since the past was too much to bear the first and only time. Scott then visits his ex-wife Peggy Rae in an attempt to see his daughter [[Cassandra Lang]]. Peggy puts Scott in his place due to him making no effort to visit her since she was in the hospital. Peggy also tells Scott that Cassandra is at a school excursion to Atlanta. While drinking at a nightclub, Ant-Man encounters [[Janice Lincoln]] and tries to take her down, only to get blasted. Janice states to Ant-Man that he should party like there is no tomorrow since it is the last night on Earth. Ant-Man takes in Janice's suggestions as they both hit the dance floor. He wakes up the next morning with Janice in his bed as the final parts of the Incursion occur.<ref>''Ant-Man: Last Days'' #1</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Ant-Man becomes a target of Whirlwind when [[Power Broker]] offers a demonstration of the Hench App to Darren Cross. When Cross was unable to pay $12,000,000.00 to Power Broker, Whirlwind received orders to not attack Ant-Man.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #1</ref> Ant-Man later helped Darla Deering when she was attacked by the second [[Magician (comics)|Magician]] (the son of the original Magician) when he was hired by a publicist named Marlena Howard through the Hench App to pretend to have a grudge against her.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #2</ref>

Scott Lang later reunited with Raz Malhotra and took him to confront Power Broker at his public promotion of the Hench App 2.0. They ended up coming into conflict with a female [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]] who Power Broker hired to guard the event. Due to Raz's inexperience in crimefighting, Blacklash got away. Following the incident, Scott Lang gave Raz an offer come with him to Florida to be trained while looking over Hank Pym's lab there. Raz accepted the offer.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #5</ref>

Scott later recruited Hijacker, Whirlwind, the new Beetle, the Voice and the Magician to his Ant-Man Security Solutions.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #8</ref> As a team, they fought Darren Cross, Crossfire and Augustine Cross to save Stinger, aka Cassie Lang.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #10</ref> After that battle, the NYPD arrested Scott for his crimes, but after a trial, he was released.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #13</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Ant-Man joins the resistance group against [[HYDRA (comics)|HYDRA]] after they takeover the U.S. After seeing footage from [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], explaining Steve Rogers' conversion into HYDRA's supreme leader, Scott is among the heroes who join Hawkeye in the search for the [[Cosmic Cube]] fragments that were scattered around the world, so they could reform the Cube and restore Steve back to normal.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1-2</ref> After he smuggles Cassie out of the country, he offers [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]] to join the resistance but Sam turns it down. Ant-Man then meets him at a bar, with a small group of heroes led by Hawkeye.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #22</ref> Hawkeye and the Tony Stark A.I. manage to convince Sam to smuggle them out of the country so they can find the Cosmic Cube fragments.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #3</ref> It is eventually revealed that HYDRA found and captured Cassie, forcing Scott to become a double agent in order to save her life. He confesses his treachery just as HYDRA's forces arrive and destroy the resistance's hideout.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #6</ref> During the final battle, Scott shrinks [[Bucky Barnes]] down so that he can enter the Cosmic Cube and reawaken [[Kobik]]. This ultimately allows Kobik to bring back the original Steve Rogers, who defeats his HYDRA doppelganger.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #10</ref>

With his reputation tarnished due to his betrayal, Scott joins the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in order to get away from Earth for a while.<ref>''All-New Guardians of the Galaxy''</ref> During a later attempt to coordinate a return to Earth for Cassie's birthday with [[Nadia van Dyne]]'s aid, things go quickly awry, and the two of them experience a series of bizarre adventures in the microverse before returning home. However, in the process the two of them became [[Quantum entanglement|quantum-entangled]] with each other.<ref>''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' #1-5 (June-August 2018)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Using a gaseous form of "Pym particles" kept in a compartment in his belt,<ref name="MarvelPr47-48"></ref> Ant-Man initially had the power to shrink himself (and other people and objects along with himself) to the size of an [[ant]] and return to normal. Over time, he has acquired the ability to change size at will.{{issue|date=August 2018}} He can also shrink to sub-microscopic size, and thereby enter the countless "[[Microverse|subatomic universes]]".<ref name="MTiO87"></ref> He retains his normal strength in ant size.

The [[cybernetic]] Ant-Man helmet allows rudimentary [[telepathy|telepathic]] communication with [[insects]], and is equipped with sound amplification equipment allowing normal-sized humans to hear its wearer. The helmet also has a retractable plexiglass face shield and a limited air supply.

Lang has advanced training and expertise in electronics, having earned an electronics technician certificate, plus additional advanced electronics training he received while in prison. At times, Lang even made his own modifications to the Ant-Man equipment, such as installing the Pym gas dispenser in his helmet rather than leaving it on his belt,<ref name="IronMan133" /> or mounting an electric disruptor into his helmet for offensive purposes.<ref name="IronMan133" />

==Other versions==

===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, Lang appears in two distinct versions. The Lang of the main MC2 continuity has long retired from the Avengers and has acted as a mentor for Cassie, who has taken up the role of the family superhero.<ref>''A-Next'' #1</ref> Also, the Thunder Guard, a group of Nazi Avengers from an alternate universe who fought A-Next, included a mentally highly unstable version of Scott called "Pincer" who had killed that universe's version of Cassie.<ref>''A-Next'' #10</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the character is '''David "Dave" Scotty''', one of the Giant-Men that was utilized on the Ultimates' Reserves.<ref>''Ultimates Annual''</ref> During a legion of [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]]' attack, he was among those that guard the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]. After vampires attack and bit him multiple times, Scotty turned into a vampire. In the ensuing battle, Dave gets killed by Peter, a fellow Giant-Man.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers''</ref>

The actual Ultimate version of Scott Lang is the second major version of '''[[Giant-Man]]'''. Dr. Lang appears as a member of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Ultimates]] during a massive showdown between the [[Ultimates]] and the Avengers. Lang later helps both teams defeat [[Gregory Stark]]'s forces in [[North Korea]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers vs. New Ultimates''</ref> His daughter Cassie later joins the Ultimates.<ref>''Ultimate Comics Ultimates'' #17</ref>

===''What If?''===
In "[[What If (comics)|What If]] Iron Man Lost the [[Armor Wars]]", Lang is captured while spying on [[Justin Hammer]], and taken prisoner along with Cassie. When Hammer is later assassinated and his knowledge over the Iron Man armor claimed by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], Scott and Cassie are taken hostage by them as well, but are eventually freed by Stark clad in the [[Firepower (comics)|Firepower]] armor.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #8</ref>
