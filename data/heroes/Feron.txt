==Fictional character biography==
Feron's ancestor, also named Feron, was born on an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate Earth]]. He was a great [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]]; Feron and [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlyn]] were both students of [[Necrom]], their race's Sorcerer Supreme. Necrom had discovered that aligning [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] would create a matrix of nearly limitless magical energy. He invited his students to help him create such a matrix. They traveled to [[Earth-616]], where Feron contacted the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. He became host to the Phoenix Force and used its powers to project an ancient tower across the omniverse, creating a copy of the tower on every alternate Earth in existence. These towers formed a permanent alignment and the energy matrix. Necrom had other plans though and tried to drain the Phoenix from Feron. Feron retaliated and strengthened by the Phoenix Force, he fought Necrom. Meanwhile, Merlyn had jumped into the energy matrix and took its powers for himself. Necrom fled with part of the Phoenix Force and the Phoenix left Feron. Feron, blaming himself for the pain the Phoenix had suffered at Necrom's hands, stayed on Earth-616 and dedicated his life to seek forgiveness. He told his children to prepare for the inevitable return of Necrom.

Centuries later, Feron's heir was a teenager, also called Feron. He was the student and ward of an unnamed order of monks based in County Sligo, Ireland, and was born in their monastery.  Feron was trained as a mystic, and became a sentinel awaiting the coming of the Anti-Phoenix. Feron had never touched the Earth, always levitating himself with his magical powers and he wore bandages around his feet to prevent contact with the ground. According to his teachers, an order of monks, Feron would become the host to the Phoenix the moment his bare feet touched the ground. Feron felt Necrom returning to Earth-616, but when his feet touched the ground nothing happened; another person, [[Rachel Summers]], had already become the host of the Phoenix. When he first met the superhero group [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], Feron felt that Rachel was unworthy of the force. Still, he assisted Rachel and her teammates battling Necrom.<ref>''Excalibur'' #48-50. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Necrom's defeat, Feron became a part of Excalibur. He waited by the ailing Rachel, hoping to claim the Phoenix Force from her if she died.<ref>''Excalibur'' #51.

Despite his arrogant behavior and social awkwardness, Feron cared about his teammates and when [[Captain Britain]] disappeared, he tried to comfort Captain Britain's girlfriend [[Meggan]], who had become catatonic with grief, transforming her body into water in stupor. Feron's magical attempt to cure her backfired and Feron joined her in suspended animation, the magical link somehow copying Meggan's elemental shapeshifting powers.<ref>''Excalibur'' #70 (October 1993).

His liquid form eventually drained away, forgotten by Excalibur. When he regained his senses, he felt that Excalibur didn't care about him, because they had never searched for him after his disappearance. He discovered the [[Crazy Gang (Marvel Comics)|Crazy Gang]], former enemies of Excalibur, who were just burying one of their own: the Executioner. The Executioner was a robot, completely hidden in green robes, who wielded an axe. Feron stole the robes and the axe and posed as the Executioner to the Crazy Gang, turning them against Excalibur again. They invaded Captain Britain's bachelor party, but when Feron was unmasked, he and Excalibur settled their differences, once he realizes that Excalibur was quite busy dealing with all other manners of threats.<ref>''Excalibur'' #124.

==Powers and abilities==
Feron has extensive magical skills which he inherited from his ancestor, Feron I. He is very adept at levitating himself. He also knows various magical spells that allow him to manipulate magical energy, bind opponents with magical spells and create protective shields. He has mystic senses enabling him to detect the presence of magic. He has admitted that he failed his [[alchemy]] exams though and transmutation is very difficult for him. While Feron's training was extensive, it wasn't until he joined Excalibur that he was forced to use his powers in combat situations, many of which Feron was not prepared for. He does have considerable knowledge and skill in the mystic arts, and was educated by an unnamed order of monks based in County Sligo, Ireland.

Feron was also trained to have the capacity to serve as a host for the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix Force]].
