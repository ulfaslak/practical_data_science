'''Nightmask''' is a name and identity used by several [[fictional]] characters who appear in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first character to bear the name, '''Keith Remsen''', was created by writer [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], and first appeared in ''Nightmask'' #1 (November [[1986 in comics|1986]]), a series which was published under Marvel's [[New Universe]] imprint. Subsequent 
characters bearing the name were introduced in the 2006 series ''[[newuniversal]]'', and as part of Marvel's 2012 rebranding, [[Marvel NOW!]]

==Publication history==
The original Nightmask, '''Keith Remsen''', was created by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]]<ref group="note">''Nightmask'' #1 erroneously credits [[Tony Salmons]] as co-creator. Later publications, such as ''[[The Draft (comics)|The Draft]]'' and ''[[The War (comics)|The War]]'', list Goodwin as Nightmask's sole creator.</ref> and first appeared in ''Nightmask'' #1 (Nov [[1986 in comics|1986]]), a series which was published under Marvel's [[New Universe]] imprint. Remsen is a paranormal, one of the people affected by the "[[White Event]]", and has the ability to manifest himself in other people's dreams. Issue #1 was penciled by [[Tony Salmons]], as lobbied for by editor Eliot R. Brown, who later explained, "I thought Tony was the quentisential {{sic}} dreamscape person because he is the last, best, natural delineator of a [[Steve Ditko|Ditko-esque]] world, aside from Steve himself."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Johnson|first= Dan|date= June 2009|title = Sparks in a Bottle: The Saga of the New Universe|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 34|page= 25|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Goodwin was the initial writer on the series, but left after issue #4. As a consequence, the 'Gnome' storyline was abandoned and subsequently ignored until long after the series' cancelation, finally being resolved in ''Untold Tales of the New Universe: Nightmask'' (published in [[2006 in comics|2006]]). Like most of the New Universe lineup of 1986-87, ''Nightmask'' was unable to secure a stable creative team; one out of every three issues was a fill-in. The series was cancelled after 12 issues, although Remsen continued to feature as a significant New Universe character, with a supporting role (and occasional back-up stories) in other titles.

In 2006, [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Salvador Larroca]] introduced a different version of the Nightmask character when they revived the New Universe concepts in a new series, ''[[newuniversal]]''. '''Izanami Randall''', who first appears in ''newuniversal'' #1 (Feb [[2007 in comics|2007]]), is a young Japanese-American woman living in San Francisco. After the White Event, Izanami discovers that she has been appointed as the Nightmask and has gained the power to manipulate the "superflow", a "transuniversal space" through which dreams, ideas and telepathy interact with the physical world.

==Fictional character biography==

===Keith Remsen===
Keith Remsen is an eighteen-year-old whose parents send him to study with [[Gnome (comics)|Doctor Horst Kleinmann]], an expert on dreams. Kleinmann has perfected a way of entering dreams cybernetically, and is worried that Remsen's parents are trying to steal his research. Kleinmann plants a bomb which kills Remsen's parents, paralyzes his little sister Theodora ("Teddy"), and leaves Keith himself in a coma, where he remains until he is awakened by the [[White Event]] and his sister calling to him.<ref name="debut">''Nightmask'' #1 (November 1986)</ref>

After awaking, he gradually discovers that he has the power to enter people's dreams telepathically, which he uses to assist in psychotherapy. His sister Teddy is able to communicate with him while he is in the dream state and serves as his anchor to reality. He also fights Kleinmann in the dreamscape.<ref name="debut"/>

After the [[Black Event]], in which the city of Pittsburgh is destroyed, Teddy is left in a coma, and Remsen becomes one of the first paranormally gifted people [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the military. His training and abilities earn him a commission and he is assigned to use his abilities to scan paranormal draftees for signs of mental aberration. Without his sister to act as his anchor, his dream self becomes more and more unhinged until he feels he can no longer tell the sane from the insane. This leads him to approve Harlan Mook, a candidate with a dangerously unstable personality. Mook has a mental breakdown and attempts to assassinate the President of the United States (thwarted only because the unnamed President has developed paranormal regenerative abilities himself).<ref>''The Draft'' (November 1988)</ref>

Remsen enters Teddy's dreams in order to release her from her coma. Though initially his Nightmask persona torments Teddy in the same way it had all the dreamers he treated since the Black Event, Keith's love for his sister overcomes the Nightmask persona, freeing Teddy from her coma and restoring the stability of his powers.<ref>''The Star Brand'' #17. Marvel Comics</ref> Remsen stalks Mook in his dreams, baiting Mook to seek him out personally. Remsen kills Mook with a single gunshot.<ref>''The War'' #1-3. Marvel Comics</ref>

==Other versions==

===Exiles===
An alternate version of Keith Remsen attempts to defeat the mutant [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] within his dreams. The attempt fails and Proteus strikes back - Remsen appears to suffer a heart attack, it is unclear whether or not he survived.

===newuniversal===
The re-imagined New Universe called [[newuniversal]] presents two different versions of Nightmask:

* '''Izanami Randall''' is as a Japanese-American girl living in [[San Francisco]], who gains the Nightmask glyph during the 2006 [[White Event]].  Izanami is pulled from the world into a transdimensional space called the superflow by an alien communication station just after receiving the glyph.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Warren Ellis]] | Artist = [[Salvador Larroca]] | Story = Trauma | Title = newuniversal | Issue = 3 | Date =  2007| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> The station informs her that she is one of the heralds of the [[paradigm shift]] which is in progress, sparked by the White Event; specifically, she is this age's Nightmask. It is the purpose of the Nightmask to help smooth the transition period of the paradigm shift due to the inevitable initial chaotic effects.
* '''Trull''' is the first Nightmask of the newuniversal imprint, and is introduced in the ''newuniversal: conqueror'' one-shot, set in the year 2,689 [[Common Era|BCE]] (some years after the first failed White Event).  Trull helped to found Latvian city of Zardath ruled by [[Starr the Slayer]], bearer of the [[Star Brand (newuniversal)#Previous Wielders of the Star Brand|Starbrand]].  It is revealed that Trull, who might have once been good, is a wholly evil man who plots Starr’s death and desires to become king.  Trull hunts down other superhumans and drains them of their minds and powers, a process that causes them to be monstrously mutated.<ref name="newuniversalconq">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Spurrier]] | Artist = [[Eric Nguyen]] | Title = newuniversal: conqueror | Issue = 1 | Date =  October 2008| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>  The character Trull is named after the wizard who appeared as an enemy of the original Starr the Slayer, in Marvel's ''Chamber of Darkness'' series.<ref name="cod4">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Roy Thomas]] | Artist = [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] | Title = Chamber of Darkness | Issue = 4 | Date =  April 1970| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>
