==Fictional character biography==
Erg was a member of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], and was one of the few Morlocks to survive the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]' attack during the '[[Mutant Massacre]]'.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} He was also one of the first mutants to seek a safe haven at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] following [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], when most mutants lost their powers.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} Erg, [[Mammomax]], and [[Peepers (Marvel Comics)|Peepers]] were running from members of the murderous Sapien League. They had the institute in sight when they were taken down by a shock grenade and tasers. The [[Leper Queen]] orders her men to kill them. The League members set up three [[Saltire|St. Andrew's]] crosses (which are "X" shaped) with braces to keep the crosses upright. Erg is tied to one of the crosses. Gasoline was poured on and a lit match tossed. Erg regains consciousness when the lower legs of the cross were blazing. He would have died if he hadn't been yanked off by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. The X-Man had been sitting in the Xavier estate woods, letting [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] sketch him.<ref>"House Of M: The Day After" #1 (Jan. 2006)</ref>

Erg remained at the Xavier Institute with many other mutants, some unwillingly, becoming something of a ringleader for the non-X-Men members of the 198. It was Erg's idea to raise a "198" flag, the number representing what was originally thought to be the number of mutants left in the world after the Decimation.<ref>"X-Men: The 198" #1</ref>  He was also one of a few mutants who attacked [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E]] (Office of National Emergency) because they want to leave the Xavier estate. {{Issue|date=July 2009}}

Erg was also one of the unfortunate mutants who accepted having an electronic tag inserted in order to be allowed to go out on a supervised group trip to Salem Center. [[Valerie Cooper|Dr. Cooper]] told the mutants that the tags were "...a harmless tracking device, inserted under the skin with a simple and painless surgical process." That was not true, as Erg later discovered, as the tags had the ability to generate disabling electronic pulses. Later, [[Mister M (comics)|Mister M]] freed the chipped mutants of their devices.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

===The Extremists===
During "The Extremists" arc, Erg reappeared alongside some of his fellow Morlocks under the leadership of [[Masque (comics)|Masque]]. Besides Erg, this group consisted of [[Bliss (Morlocks)|Bliss]], [[Litterbug (comics)|Litterbug]],  the undercover [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], and the captured [[Leech (comics)|Leech]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' 488-491 (2007)</ref>

===Dark Reign===
Erg is shown as one of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s mutant prisoners after the riots in San Francisco.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #7</ref> He later took refuge on Utopia, and participated in the fight against the attacking [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrods]].<ref>''New Mutants #14</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Erg is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who is able to absorb all forms of energy and project them in blasts from his right eye, which he calls his "electric eye".
