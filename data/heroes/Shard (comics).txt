'''Shard Bishop''' is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
Shard was a Lieutenant in [[Xavier's Security Enforcers]], (X.S.E.) with her older brother [[Bishop (comics)|Lucas Bishop]] in their native timeline in the 2080s.  She is the daughter of mutant [[Aboriginal Australians|Indigenous Australian]] refugees (their ancestor is the mutant [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]]) who fled Australia for America the day before it was devastated in a nuclear attack.  Shard was born and raised in a mutant concentration camp, in which mutants were branded over their right eyes with the letter "M" for recognition.  In [[Uncanny X-Men]] Annual #17, Shard is stated as having the mutant ability of "transubbing ambient light into concussive force".{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Shard became the youngest X.S.E. graduate a year after Bishop attained that position.  She served under Bishop as a member of the Omega Squad (which included Bishop and his officers, Randall and Malcolm), until her promotion.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Together, in the X.S.E. Shard and Bishop were responsible for apprehending criminal mutants.  Shard was partially infected on a mission with her brother fighting a group infected with a vampire-like affliction originating from the present day mutant, [[Emplate]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Although Emplates are considered the "living dead", Bishop took her to the New York Stark/Fujikawa building inhabited by the [[Alternative versions of Gambit#Bishop'future|Witness]] in order to attempt to save her life by transmitting her essence into a holographic matrix (a technology of [[Shi'ar]] origin, akin to that used in the X-Men's [[Danger Room]]).  Here he was said to have made a deal in order for the experiment to even happen in the first place, the price being that he would work for him for a specified period of time.  The experiment was a success, but Shard, already partially infected with the Emplate affliction, died.  Due to the process involved, Bishop considered himself her murderer.{{issue|date=December 2012}}  The extent of, as well as the type of work he did in this deal is still yet to be known, if it ever will be.<ref>''Messiah Complex'' TPB</ref>

Bishop eventually travelled back in time, to the present, in an effort to track down [[Trevor Fitzroy]], one of his time's most-wanted criminals and Shard's ex-lover, where he became stuck in the present day and became a member of the [[X-Men]], his idols.  Shard has also since been recreated in the present, as a computer construct, and became a clandestine member of the government-sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team. There, she began a romantic relationship with her teammate [[Wildchild (comics)|Wildchild]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

After X-Factor disbanded in ''X-Factor #149'', Shard was transported into an alternate future. There she died for the second and apparently final time, saving her brother Bishop.<ref>''Bishop: the Last X-Man #14''</ref> from Trevor Fitzroy, her former paramour who had attempted to seduce her into becoming his consort once again by restoring her body to its original solid form.
