==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=January 2018}}
Toni Ho first appeared in ''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #1 (December 2015), and created by [[Al Ewing]] (writer) and [[Gerardo Sandoval]] (artist).

==Fictional character biography==

Dr. Toni Ho is [[Ho Yinsen]]'s daughter who is an engineer with three doctorates.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4 #1</ref> 

She becomes a member of the rehabilitated [[Avengers Idea Mechanics]] after being bought out by [[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto da Costa]]. As part of the group, she serves as part of a support team for the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Toni also studied [[Aikku Jokinen]], the wearer of the sentient Pod suit. Toni took an interest in Aikku, not only due to the Pod suit but because she sympathizes with Aikku's personal reasons for not wanting to take Pod off. Toni falls in love with Aikku, and Aikku reciprocated these feelings. Both were attacked by the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] and Toni donned her own Iron Man armor to defend Aikku and Pod. When Pod ejected Aikku, Toni helps her love interest with the new undersuit.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4  #13-15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Toni later uses her own Iron Patriot armor as a member of the [[U.S.Avengers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/07/01/marvel-is-creating-an-america-themed-avengers-led-by-a-british-writer-and-a-brazilian-mutant/|title=Marvel is creating an America-themed Avengers — led by a British writer and a Brazilian mutant|first=David|last=Betancourt|date=1 July 2016|accessdate=25 January 2018|website=Washingtonpost.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124005659/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/07/01/marvel-is-creating-an-america-themed-avengers-led-by-a-british-writer-and-a-brazilian-mutant/|archivedate=24 January 2018}}</ref> In their first mission, the team encountered the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] in a floating volcanic island base. They're later approached by a [[Danielle Cage|future equivalent]] of Captain America when the Golden Skull arrived in the present timeline to steal all the world's wealth. In [[Miami, Florida]], the team crashes a charity gala only to discover that the wealthy CEOs were kidnapped and replaced by robots. During the battle, the team manages to defeat and capture the Golden Skull wearing a golden armored suit, and Captain America then goes back to the future timeline with the Golden Skull as prisoner.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the "[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Aikku gets concerned about Toni, since she's been spending too much time upgrading her Iron Patriot armor.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the event, the team arrives in [[Washington D.C.]] to confront Hydra when [[Robert Maverick]] attacks the group due to nanites that were injected by Hydra double-agent Kyle. In an attempt to save the group, Toni used a teleportation device to send Enigma and [[Squirrel Girl]] away, where they ended up in Paris. She and the Red Hulk are then captured and imprisoned, when they see Roberto nearly dead in one of the cells. While adjusting to prison life, Toni manages to save Roberto just in time when Hydra soldiers arrive at their cell. At the prison, Toni helps Roberto to defeat the guards and free Red Hulk from the controlling nanites, enabling them to take control of the prison. She then makes contact with Enigma, after she and Squirrel Girl help the Champions of Europe to defeat Hydra soldiers in Paris, and makes plans to have them return to the US. She also tells Enigma that she'll quit the Iron Patriot mantle so that their relationship can continue. During the course of this imprisonment, Toni lets go of some of her anger towards her father's sacrifice, a heroic act that should be honored. In the aftermath of the event, Toni deactivates Red Hulk's nanites, enabling Maverick to return to normal. She's later approached by some A.I.M. agents who want her to be the organization's new leader after Roberto quits.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #6-10. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

While traveling through space, Smasher and the U.S.Avengers are attacked by space pirates known as warpjackers. After a brief fight, the pirates tell them that Glenbrook is actually the planet Kral X and that its ruler Ritchie Redwood is ruthless. Arriving in Kral X, the heroes manage to help Cannonball and the planet's rebels in overthrowing Ritchie. After restoring order to the planet, the heroes head home.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #11-12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Roberto left the American Intelligence Mechanics, Toni succeeded and allowed the rogue [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] cells to regain their acronym as Toni had her organization rebranded as R.E.S.C.U.E.<ref>''Avengers'' #690. Marvel Comics.</ref>
