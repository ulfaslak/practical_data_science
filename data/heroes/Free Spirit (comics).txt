As a [[graduate student]], Cathy Webster participates in an unsanctioned [[psychology]] experiment involving [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] recordings. She is subliminally programmed to hate all men, and her body is subjected to "mutagenic radiation". The radiation enhances her body to peak physical condition similar to [[Captain America]]. Cathy eventually overcomes her brainwashing and discovers the woman in charge of the experiment, a criminal scientist named [[Superia]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 1 #431</ref> She also crosses paths with the criminal [[Baron Zemo]] and the morally ambiguous [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 1 #432-433</ref> Captain America and Cathy aid another hero, [[Jack Flag]], in defeating the [[Serpent Society]], who had infiltrated Sandhaven, [[Arizona]]. She infiltrated their headquarters and attacked [[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]], defeating her and wearing her costume as a disguise.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 1 #434-436</ref> Captain America then takes Free Spirit and Jack Flag under his wing, where he trains them to be heroes. They join Captain America's network of computer operatives called the "Captain America Hotline", fighting against [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]], [[AIM (comics)|AIM]], and [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]]. When Captain America temporarily loses his powers due to the breakdown of the Super Soldier Serum in his bloodstream, he bequeathed the hotline to Jack, Cathy, [[Fabian Stankowicz]] and [[Moonhunter|Zach Moonhunter]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 1 #437-444</ref>

After Steve Rogers was restored to his prime, he recruited Jack Flag and Free Spirit as part of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in order to combat the growing threat of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]. They went to [[Bagalia]] to deal with [[Baron Zemo]] and his 'New Masters'. However, Jack ignored Captain America's orders to remain with Free Spirit and went after Zemo himself, confronting him on his getaway plane and defeating him. Angry at him, Rogers throws Flag from the airplane without a parachute, before saying "Hail Hydra" at the end of the issue.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #1</ref> Free Spirit manages to find him on the street, unconscious but alive, until all the villains of Bagalia attempt to kill them. They are eventually rescued by Steve Rogers and the S.H.I.E.L.D. squad in time to get Jack Flag medical attention, who fell into a coma as a result of the injury.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #3</ref> She is later seen talking to a comatose Jack on the medical bay when [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] arrives, attempting to cheer her up.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #4</ref> When Steve Rogers attempted to kill Jack, by injecting him with a poison, Free Spirit arrives and tells Steve that Jack's family had decided to disconnect him. During Jack's funeral, Steve tries to help Cathy and Rick, who are still in grief.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #10-11</ref>
