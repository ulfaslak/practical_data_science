Martinex's appearance was redesigned in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #7 (Dec. 1990). Writer/artist [[Jim Valentino]] commented, "No one could draw [Martinex] the same way twice. It was impossible and it was a pain in the butt. What I did was streamline him according to the planes in the body that [[Andrew Loomis]] delineated in his seminal book, ''Figure Drawing for All It's Worth''."<ref name="back65"/>

Martinex appeared along with the rest of the original Guardians of the Galaxy team in the 2014 series ''[[Guardians 3000]]''.  Writer [[Dan Abnett]] described him as "the brain" of the team.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.newsarama.com/21436-marvels-old-guardians-up-to-new-tricks-in-guardians-3000.html|title= Marvel’s Old Guardians Up To New Tricks in ''Guardians 3000''|first= Chris|last= Arrant|date= June 25, 2014|publisher= Newsarama|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160127190938/http://www.newsarama.com/21436-marvels-old-guardians-up-to-new-tricks-in-guardians-3000.html|archivedate= January 27, 2016|deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
In their future, [[Earth]] had colonized several planets in its [[solar system]], including [[Pluto]]. Martinex was born on Cerberus Center, Pluto, although it was later revealed his ancestors were from the continent of [[Africa]] on Earth.

He grew up to become a [[scientist]] and technician. Like the other Pluvians, Martinex's body was completely covered by facets that were crystalline in appearance. This design was so that the Pluvians could withstand the extreme temperatures of their world. Martinex could also emit heat and cold from his hands. Martinex became the last surviving Plutonian after the [[Badoon]] exterminated all the other Plutonians, as he was working on Pluto's moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]]. The Pluvians had been forewarned of the attack, but the ship they were escaping on was destroyed by the Badoon. Martinex escaped the Badoon using a telepod and teamed with [[Vance Astro]], a [[human]] [[astronaut]] from the 20th century with psychic powers, [[Charlie-27]], a [[Jupiter|Jovian]] who was the last of his race as well, and [[Yondu]], from [[Alpha Centauri]], to fight the Badoon as the freedom fighters, the Guardians of the Galaxy.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Arnold Drake|Drake, Arnold]]|penciller= [[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]]|inker= [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]]|story= Guardians of the Galaxy!|title= [[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]|issue= 18|date= January 1969}}</ref> It was later revealed [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]] had manipulated events to bring them together.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

Eventually, Martinex left the team to form a larger version of the Guardians, known as the [[Galactic Guardians]]. This team was summoned to help rescue an imperiled planet full of innocents.

==Powers and abilities==
Martinex is a member of a genetically engineered offshoot of humanity whose traits were designed for survival under the cold conditions of the planet Pluto. He possesses enhanced strength, speed, and stamina, and superhuman durability. His epidermis is composed of a silicon-isotope organic crystal. Martinex has the ability to convert bodily energy into laser-like beams of energy which he can project from his hands. His right hand can project infrared energy, stimulating heat in any object. His left hand can project microwave energy that reduces thermal energies in objects, thereby producing coldness. His body is highly resistant to intense heat and cold as well as other conventional forms of injury. Martinex can only use his superhuman powers to project heat and cold at maximum output for up to one half-hour before having to rest in order to replenish them.

Martinex has earned doctorates in physics and engineering. He possesses expertise in various areas of 31st Century technology, including computers and cyborg design.
