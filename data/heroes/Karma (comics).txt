'''Karma''' ('''Xi'an Coy Manh''') is a fictional [[superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], mostly in association with The [[X-Men]]. The character was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].

Karma is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] endowed with the ability to seize control of another's mind, though she has sometimes been depicted with other more extensive [[psionics|psionic]] abilities. The origin of the character relates to the [[Vietnam War]], as she and her family were among the [[boat people]] fleeing the country shortly after the advent of [[Communism]] and in the wake of violence. Her [[Vietnam]]ese origin contributes to two of her main traits—her [[Catholicism]] and her mastery of the [[French language]], both of which stem from [[France]]'s strong historical [[History of Vietnam#19th century and French colonization|influence in Vietnam]]. Karma, in fact, speaks [[English language|English]] with a French accent rather than a Vietnamese one.

Karma was one of the five founding members of the [[New Mutants]], along with [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Danielle Moonstar|Mirage]], [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]. Being several years older than the others, and the [[legal guardian]] of her siblings from a young age, she was the most mature member, and the only one in the original lineup who was introduced in published comics before the team itself.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Buchanan|first=Bruce |title=The New Mutants: From Superhero Spin-Off to Sci-Fi/Fantasy|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29|page=63 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Karma is one of the first major [[lesbian]] characters in a mainstream comic book.

==Fictional character biography==

===Introduction===
Xi'an (pronounced and nicknamed "Shan") Coy Manh was born in the central highlands of Vietnam. Xi'an's origins are rooted in tragedy. Her father was a colonel in the [[South Vietnam]]ese army who was forced to bring his wife and four children on missions. When Xi'an's twin brother, Tran Coy Manh, was attacked by a [[Viet Cong]] soldier, Xi'an's power of [[Mind control in popular culture|mind possession]] emerged to protect him. Tran soon exhibited the identical power, although he relished using it cruelly. While Tran was rescued from the throes of war by their crime lord uncle, General Nguyen Ngoc Coy, Xi'an's father was shot and killed during the [[fall of Saigon]].{{issue|date=March 2017}} Xi'an escaped on a cramped boat with hundreds of others, including her mother and her younger brother and sister, Leong and Nga. The boat was boarded by Thai pirates on the way to the [[United States]]; Xi'an and her mother were raped by the pirates and her mother died shortly thereafter.

Arriving in [[New York City]], a program to help Vietnamese immigrants run by the [[Catholic]] priest Father Michael Bowen ([[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger's]] uncle) helped Xi'an find work and an apartment. However, General Coy insisted she use her powers in his service, as Tran was already doing, and kidnapped Leong and Nga when she refused. Possessing [[Spider-Man]], she attempted to use him to reclaim the children from a party her uncle was holding. The [[Fantastic Four]] intervened. Tran, not realizing Xi'an was in control of Spider-Man, forced her out of Spider-Man's mind in possessing him long enough for the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to knock him out. With technical aid from [[Professor X]], the Fantastic Four and Spider-Man located Xi'an. After an initial misunderstanding, they agreed to help her reclaim the children, but Tran possessed the Fantastic Four and set them against Spider-Man. Spider-Man was outmatched by Tran's ability to use the Fantastic Four as a single cohesive force due to his greater experience with his powers. Xi'an finally lashed out, absorbing her brother completely and taking the name Karma. Her powers doubled after absorbing her brother.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #100</ref>

===New Mutants===
[[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] refers Karma to [[Professor X]], and she becomes his first recruit for his new team of mutant teenagers, the New Mutants. Karma had been working a full-time job to support herself and her siblings, and so agrees to work as Xavier's secretary to help him run the school in return for a generous salary.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #4: ''New Mutants''</ref>

During an attack by the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], the other New Mutants begin implicitly following Karma as their leader.<ref>''New Mutants'' #2</ref> During a fight with [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] and the [[Silver Samurai]], the mutant psychic entity [[Shadow King|Amahl Farouk]] takes Karma as a host body. She disappears and the rest of the team fears her to be dead.<ref>''New Mutants'' #6–7</ref> Possessed by Farouk, she becomes a crime boss and runs a gladiatorial arena. She becomes grossly obese while possessed, as Farouk was a large eater in life and had continued his voracity when using Karma's body. When two of the New Mutants ([[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Magma (comics)|Magma]]) are forced to participate in the high-stakes gladiatorial competition, she comes into conflict with her old teammates.<ref>''New Mutants'' #30–31</ref>

The New Mutants pursue her and ultimately drive Farouk to flee from Karma's body, and she defeats him in psychic combat.<ref>''New Mutants'' #32–34</ref> The New Mutants and Storm take a vacation on a small Grecian island. There they are abducted by the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]]. [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] attempts to teleport everyone away, but her teleport disc collides with the barrier around the Enchantress's castle, and they are tossed through space and time. Karma ends up in a desert wasteland and, still despondent at her obesity, she decides to lay down and die. However, the [[Norns (Marvel Comics)|Norns]] intervene and place a young child near her, compelling Karma to survive in order to help the child out of the desert. Karma and the child live in the desert for months, using her powers to stun the wildlife for food, and scavenging weapons and shelter from travelers who have perished in the wasteland. By the time she reaches the end of the desert and reunites with the other New Mutants, she has shed her excess weight and her hair had grown to waist-length. When [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] returns the New Mutants and X-Men to Earth, although he undoes most of their transformations — such as Moonstar having become a [[Valkyrie]] and thus inherited a winged steed — he ensures that Karma retains her new slimmer physique.<ref>''New Mutants Special Edition'' #1; ''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #9</ref> After an encounter with — and temporary death at the hands of — the [[Beyonder]], she and her fellow New Mutants are briefly transferred to the [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]] and join the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #38–40</ref>

Father Bowen, Karma's [[Confession (religion)|confessor]], cared for Leong and Nga during Karma's absence, but she resumes caring for the youths upon her return to the New Mutants, living in a small apartment on Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]]. During the [[Mutant Massacre]], Leong and Nga fail to turn up at home after leaving school.<ref>''New Mutants'' #46</ref> The Xavier School's headmaster, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], is unable to locate the missing children, even with the resources of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] at his disposal. Believing her uncle has a better chance of finding them, Karma leaves the New Mutants to return to General Coy's service in exchange for his help.<ref>''New Mutants'' #54</ref>

===Searching for Leong and Nga===
In Madripoor, she works to help her uncle establish himself as one of the nation's two major crime lords. After the X-Man [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] appeals to her conscience, she begins covertly acting against Coy when his actions threaten innocent lives.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #4 (1989)</ref> General Coy strings Karma along for several months with promises of finding the children, but after he and some of his associates orchestrate the massacre of an entire village, she breaks her ties with him.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #28–30 (1990)</ref>

Karma continues her search independently, and learns the children were abducted by [[Shinobi Shaw]] and sold to Viper and [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], intent on sending the children through the "Body Shoppe". With the aid of Cannonball and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], Karma finally locates and frees Leong and Nga,<ref>''Beast'' #1–3 (1997)</ref> while learning that her brother's essence is still alive, though dormant, within her.

Karma reunites with the original New Mutants when they meet their past selves traveling to the present.<ref>''New Mutants: Truth or Death'' miniseries</ref> Karma evidences expanded telepathic powers, specifically removing the memories of the older New Mutants from the minds of the younger ones by briefly possessing them.<ref>''New Mutants: Truth or Death'' #3 (1997)</ref> Karma later meets many New Mutants friends, in the form of X-Force, at a desert rave, where she drastically altered her appearance with dyed hair, body piercings, and revealing clothing; a surprising difference to the image held by many of her former teammates.<ref>''X-Force'' #75 (1998)</ref>

She moves to [[Chicago]] with Leong and Nga and takes a job as a [[librarian]] for the [[University of Chicago]] while attending classes.<ref>''Mekanix'' #1 (1997)</ref> There, she runs into [[Shadowcat]] and assists her in her mission against the anti-mutant hate group, Purity, while also hinting at a same sex attraction to her.<ref>''Mekanix Starring Shadowcat'' #1-6 (2003)</ref> Not long after, she came out as gay.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #4 (2003)</ref>

===Teacher at Xavier's===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Karma (comics).jpg|thumb|right|125px|Karma performing administrative functions. Art by Michael Ryan.]] -->

She is specifically chosen as a mentor by the younger student [[Anole (comics)|Anole]],<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #5–7</ref> and later is mentor to all students less than fifteen years of age (thus too young to be assigned to [[New X-Men#Founding|squads]]). She returns to a more modest appearance and attire to better reflect her new position.

When [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair]] leaves the Xavier Institute due to a romance with [[Elixir (comics)|a younger student]], her position as advisor of the Paragons squad is left to Karma. Upon the (temporary) death of [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], Karma also becomes the advisor to his squad, the [[Alpha Squadron (comics)|Alpha Squadron]]. [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] eventually takes over duties as the advisor of the Paragons, yet that still leaves Karma as the librarian, French teacher, and advisor to the Lower School and Alpha Squadron.

===Reforming the New Mutants===
Karma accompanies Mirage to a small Colorado town to investigate reports of a dangerous young mutant. After they turn up missing, Cannonball obtains permission from [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] to track them down, teaming up with old New Mutants members Magma, Sunspot and Magik, who reappeared at the X-Men's base after teleporting off into the future after the events of "[[X-Infernus]]." Magik informs Cannonball and Sunspot that Karma and Mirage are in danger which would result in their deaths.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #1</ref> As it turns out, Karma's consciousness is trapped inside [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]]'s mind, and she is ultimately rescued by Magik with the aid of her Soulsword.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #4</ref>

Due to their success in reining in the dangerous Legion, Karma and the other former New Mutants on the mission are sanctioned as an X-Men squad by Cyclops.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

===Utopia===
Karma is seen during the riots in San Francisco with Armor, [[Match (Marvel Comics)|Match]], Angel, and [[Bling (comics)|Bling]] trying to keep calm. She tells [[Nekra]] and [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]] to behave when [[Moonstone (comics)|Ms. Marvel]] blasts the duo, taking them out.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia'' #1</ref>

In the aftermath of Utopia, Xi'an goes to see [[Kavita Rao]] with Magik where they inform her of what went on in Legion's mind. When Kavita mistakes Marci for one of Legion's personalities, Xi'an corrects her and reveals that Marci was a real person but when she exited his mind, Legion revealed Marci does not have a body to return to and explains how his powers work. She then reveals that one of Legion's personalities killed her after she bought Legion water and played together when he got back from the Age of Apocalypse. Feeling angry, Illyana offers her soulsword to Xi'an who kills the alternate personality. However Xi'an lies to Kavita about what happened as does Magik, both claiming Magik killed him.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #5</ref>

===Second Coming===
Karma is sent with her teammates to engage [[The Right (comics)|The Right]] and [[Cameron Hodge]] at his facility. During the battle, she attempts to take psionic control of Hodge, but he proves immune to her powers and impales her through the leg with his metal projectiles.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #12 (April 2010)</ref> Hodge is defeated, but as a result of her injuries, Karma's left leg is amputated above the knee.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #524</ref> She then gets a new prosthetic leg from [[Madison Jeffries]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===''Astonishing X-Men''===
Karma joins an ad hoc team of X-Men who find themselves under attack by the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]].<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (vol. 3) #48 (2012)</ref> The Marauders are controlled by Susan Hatchi, a successful weapons developer who wished to test out new nanotechnology that her company had developed.<ref>"Astonishing X-Men" (vol. 3) #52 (2012)</ref>

After seizing control of Karma, it is revealed that Hatchi also had ulterior personal reasons for targeting the mutant. Born Da'o Coy Manh, she is the illegitimate half-sister of Karma. Da'o's mother had sought out their father for protection and for Da'o to be recognized as his daughter. Instead, he shot and killed her mother. He then abandons Da'o to work at a [[sweatshop]].<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (vol. 3) #55 (2012)</ref> Da'o eventually manifested low-level telepathic powers, changed her name and began building her weapons development company. She later discovered that their father had used his influence to smuggle his legitimate family to the U.S., which made her resentment grow. This was further compounded when her powers were lost during [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{issue|date=November 2012}}

In a later confrontation with the X-Men, Hatchi uses her nanotechnology to seize control of the team and orders them to takeover Madripoor or she will use her technology on New York and kill the population.<ref>"Astonishing X-Men #54 (vol. 3) (2012)</ref> She wants to not only demonstrate the effectiveness of her weapon but to draw out their father from hiding by publicly using Karma as bait.<ref>Id. </ref> While she is able to locate her father in Madripoor, the X-Men are able to counteract the technology.<ref>Id. </ref> Karma uses her own mutant abilities to forge a psychic link with her half-sister and show her the struggles she's had in her own life, despite the fact that their father acknowledged her.<ref>"Astonishing X-Men" (vol. 3) #56 (2012)</ref> While the two sisters reach reconciliation, their father takes advantage of their engagement and shoots Hatchi.<ref>Id. </ref> He is arrested by the police for her murder.<ref>Id. </ref> After Hatchi's death, Karma inherits her company as the only eligible relative of age and effectively becomes a billionaire.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (vol. 3) #56 (2012)</ref>

Karma later appears as a member of the Utopians alongside [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]], [[Madison Jeffries]], [[Masque (comics)|Masque]], [[Random (comics)|Random]], and [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]], seeking peace in the former X-Men's base at [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref>''All-New X-Men'' (vol. 1) #40-41 (2015)</ref>

===''Dead Souls''===
In the "New Mutants: Dead Souls" miniseries,  Karma enlists the aid of former new mutants Magik, [[Rictor (comics)|Rictor]], Wolfsbane and Boom-Boom plus [[Strong Guy]] to investigate a paranormal threat, using the Hatchi Corporation resources and influence at her disposal.<ref>"New Mutants: Dead Souls" #1 (2018)</ref> In fact, Karma's brother, Tran Coy Manh, believed to be long dead when absorbed by Karma,<ref>"Marvel Team Up" #100 (1980)</ref>  is revealed to have existed as a psychic being and sought revenge against his sister.<ref>"New Mutants: Dead Souls" #4 (2018)</ref> During the confrontation, Karma, along with Magik, Strong Guy and Wolfsbane, were infected by Warlock's [[techno-organic virus]] and absorbed into a [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]-like construct, which had already infected and absorbed Mirage, in a bizarre attempt for survival and to recreate the likenesses of Warlock's allies in the New Mutants.<ref>"New Mutants: Dead Souls #6 (2018)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Karma is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to take possession of the minds of other people or animals. She projects a psionic energy surge that overwhelms the [[consciousness]] of another; this renders the victim unconscious while placing her own mind in command. It allows her to alter the victim's perceptions and memories, command people to fall asleep or divulge information, and operate their bodies as if they were an extension of her own.

Formerly when Karma first took possession of someone, she could only move her subject's body awkwardly until she acclimated herself to her new host. If she remained in possession of a host for too long she would begin to think and act as her host would, and eventually her own personality would become subordinate to one identical to the host's. Although Karma can possess multiple subjects simultaneously, her control over her subjects is fragmented as she shifts her attention from one to another.

Karma had also begun developing other telepathic abilities that were either latent or triggered by her possession by the [[Shadow King]]. By possessing others remotely, she can mentally "see" through their eyes. She is also able to use her power to disrupt other psi-signatures, protecting her from all manner of psychic assault.<ref>''New Mutants: Truth or Death'' #2</ref>

Karma is also a capable combatant with medieval weapons (particularly swords), due to the extended period of time she spent in Asgard. She is also familiar with [[first aid]] and [[firearm]]s owing to her time in Vietnam.

Karma keeps quiet as long as she can, but when the Shadow King is released on her, she gives away the desired information. She is then discarded outside Apocalypse's stronghold.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' #2 (1995)</ref>

Learning of his assistant's fate, Angel searches for her. He is blinded by rage at the time, and when an Infinite guard calls out to him, he shoots the guard with his gun.
