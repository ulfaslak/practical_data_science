===Origin===

Instead, it turned out that Microbe had unknowingly used his mutant power and "talked" the diseases into acting out the results his father wanted.<ref>''New Warriors'' Vol. 3 #1</ref> Disgraced, his father disowned Microbe, leaving the teen heartbroken and alone. Out of compassion, [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]] adopted him and began training him to be a superhero, making him a member of the New Warriors.{{issue|date=March 2013}}
