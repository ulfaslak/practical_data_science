===Origin===

Instead, it turned out that Microbe had unknowingly used his mutant power and "talked" the diseases into acting out the results his father wanted.<ref>''New Warriors'' Vol. 3 #1</ref> Disgraced, his father disowned Microbe, leaving the teen heartbroken and alone. Out of compassion, [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]] adopted him and began training him to be a superhero, making him a member of the New Warriors.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

While tracking some escaped supervillains with the New Warriors, Microbe, alongside his foster father Night Thrasher, is killed in Stamford, Connecticut as part of the New Warriors reality show.<ref>''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' #1</ref>  This event sparks the need for the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and the ensuing [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]],{{issue|date=March 2013}} as well as making the surviving and former New Warriors members the most hated people in the US.{{issue|date=March 2013}}
