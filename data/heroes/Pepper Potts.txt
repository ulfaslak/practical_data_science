==Publication history==
Virginia "Pepper" Potts first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #45 (September 1963), which was written by [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] with a story plot by [[Stan Lee]] and illustrated by [[Don Heck]]. Though she was named Pepper Potts from the start, Stark addresses her as "Kitty" in one panel, which is thought to be a typo. Heck modeled Potts as [[Ann B. Davis]]’ character of Schultzy from ''[[The Bob Cummings Show]]'', and she is rendered with brown hair done up in a hairdo similar to Schultzy's. Someone on the creative team or in editorial came to feel that the resemblance was too great, and in ''Tales of Suspense'' #50, Potts' look was altered to give her red hair and a different hairdo.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early history===
Potts is originally a member of a secretarial pool, and gets her job by fixing an accounting error made by Stark. She is depicted initially as being infatuated with Stark, and rejects the advances of Stark's chauffeur and assistant [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]], who debuted in the same issue, with acerbic remarks. As Stark's affection for her grows in the ensuing issues, she becomes part of a love triangle between the two men, and eventually falls in love with and marries Hogan, eloping with him in ''Tales of Suspense'' #91.<ref>Cronin, Brian (June 29, 2010).

[[File:Peppervirginiapotts.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Pepper and Happy Hogan.]]
Pepper and Happy eventually leave [[Stark Industries]], settling in the Rocky Mountains and then finally in Cleveland, where they adopt children after being unable to conceive, and disappear from the main Iron Man storyline. After being kidnapped by Stark's rival [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], Pepper tells Tony to stay out of their lives. Pepper and Happy soon divorce after she has an affair with a former college boyfriend. After Tony Stark's return from the [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]] universe, Pepper and Happy join Tony at his new company, [[Stark Industries#Stark Solutions|Stark Solutions]], and once again become core characters. After some time, Happy and Pepper once again became involved and remarry, eventually considering conceiving a child to supplement their adopted children. Stark entrusts Pepper with a special remote that could shut him down. However, Pepper, tortured by the responsibility, is forced to return it, and the trauma causes her to miscarry. Stark is able to deal with the remote, but feels guilty that he has placed her in such danger.

After Happy sustains massive injuries in a fight with [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] during the 2006-2007 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, Pepper requests that Tony turn off Happy's life support. Happy dies in ''Invincible Iron Man'' (vol. 4) #14.

===The Order===
After the events of the "Civil War" story line, Pepper joins the [[Fifty State Initiative]] as a member of [[The Order (comics)|The Order]], a government sanctioned superhero team operating within [[California]]. She assumes the moniker of the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] Hera, and uses advanced computer-hardware and prosthetics to monitor and coordinate the team's missions. Upon the absorption of The Order into the Initiative, Tony Stark offers her a job on the special-projects team at Stark Enterprises, which she accepts.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===2008 – present===
Pepper Potts resumes her activities as personal secretary of Tony Stark. When Pepper is caught in a terrorist explosion caused by [[Zeke Stane|Ezekiel "Zeke" Stane]], she sustains multiple internal injuries, including shrapnel wounds, and rendered unable to withstand a prolonged surgery. In response, Tony embeds a strong magnet (similar in appearance to the arc reactor of the movie) in her chest, essentially turning Pepper into a [[cyborg]] dependent on keeping her chest magnet engaged to stay alive, as he was once.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=The Five Nightmares Part 3: Pepper Potts At the End of the World|title=The Invincible Iron Man|issue=3|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=Sept. 2008}}</ref>

Pepper's body is further enhanced with new cybernetics and upgrades to the magnet, which are based on [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]]'s battery designs, and which afford Pepper new super abilities.<ref name="IronManVol5#4">{{cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=The Five Nightmares Part 4: Neutron Bomb Heart|title=The Invincible Iron Man|issue=4|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=October 2008}}</ref>

When Tony is blamed for the [[Skrull]] invasion of Earth that occurs in the 2008 storyline "[[Secret Invasion]]", [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] is taken over by [[Norman Osborn]], replaced with [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]], and Stark and Maria Hill are fired, along with all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s employees. Tony realizes that Osborn is after the identities of superhumans that registered with the government following the passage of the Superhuman Registration Act that occurred during the "Civil War" storyline, which is stored in a database in his brain. Stark decides to go underground with Hill, and to wipe the knowledge in his own brain. Stark makes Pepper the new [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Stark Industries, trusting only her to shut down the company in his absence. Pepper discovers a secret room in Stark's office which contains a suit of armor that he made especially for her,<ref name="IronManVol5#10"/> which she uses under the name Rescue.<ref name="IronManVol5#14"/> Though Osborn has seized all Stark Industries facilities and equipment, Pepper states that all components of her armor are legal and that the design specifications are available to anyone. Despite Osborn threatening her loved ones with prison if she interferes with his search for Tony or attempts any more heroic actions, after being freed she endeavors to find Tony herself.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Part 7: The Shape of the World These Days|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=14|date=August 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> They are reunited in Russia,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Part 6: Some King of the World|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=14|date=July 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> and consummate a now-sexual relationship, but are subsequently captured and tortured by [[Madame Masque]], who was assigned by Norman Osborn to track Stark down. Stark admits that he had loved Masque in the past,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Part 8: The Danger We're All In|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=15|date=Sept. 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> but when pressed to make a choice, with his own life on the line, Tony chooses Pepper. Pepper decides to engage Masque in a physical altercation in order to provide a distraction for Stark to escape.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Part 9: Titan of the Nuclear Age|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=16|date=October 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

During the 2009 "World's Most Wanted Storyline" (which ran concurrently with Marvel's company-wide storyline "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]"), Pepper, after defeating Masque, disguises herself as the former, infiltrating H.A.M.M.E.R. while presenting the Rescue armor to Osborn as spoils of battle. Pepper reveals herself when she rescues [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Maria Hill]] from Osborn's imprisonment, while the Rescue suit uploads a virus into H.A.M.M.E.R.'s computers, taking control of the Helicarrier's armory of suits.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Part 11: Kids with Guns vs. The Eternal Angel of Death|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=18|date=Nov. 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> They then retrieve the hard drive that Hill was assigned by Stark to get, escaping to give it to [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]] in order to restore Starks' mind.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=World's Most Wanted Conclusion: Into the White (Einstein on the Beach)|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=19|date=Dec. 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> As part of "re-booting" Tony (in a vegetative state), the magnet in her chest is removed and placed into his.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salvador|story=Stark: Disassembled Part 2: Digging in the Dirt|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=21|date=February 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Though Stark's memories are restored from a somewhat years-old backup, he no longer remembers the events of the "Civil War" nor his role in it, its aftermath or his affair with Pepper. Pepper survives the removal of her chest magnet, but demands that a new one similar to Tony's own chest repulsor be re-installed, which is done. Recovered, Stark also gifts Pepper with a new Rescue armor, complete with JARVIS.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|artist=Salvador Larocca|story=Stark Resilient Part 4: Grand Mal Tokyo Moron Party|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=28|date=Sept. 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

During the 2011 "Stark Resilient" storyline, when [[Justine Hammer]] and [[Sasha Hammer]] use their own armored enforcer [[Detroit Steel]] to attempt to sabotage Stark Resilient (Tony's new company) and its design for a repulsor technology-powered vehicle, Pepper joins [[War Machine]] in helping Stark, during which Pepper experiences a [[near-death experience]] in which JARVIS, masquerading as Happy, gives Pepper a cryptic warning of the future.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|artist=Salvador Larocca|story=Stark Resilient Part 8: Drones Scream Down|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=32|date=January 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

In the 2012 storyline "The Future", Pepper returns to her civilian life following her destruction of J.A.R.V.I.S., the [[artificial intelligence]] that helped her control her Rescue armor,<ref name=IronMan526/> after its compromise led it to go rogue and attempt to kidnap her.<ref name=IronMan523>{{cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|artist=Larocca, Salavdor|story=The Future Part 3: Swarm|title=The Invincible Iron Man|issue=523|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=October 2012}}</ref> She became engaged to Marc Kumar, a public relations and marketing consultant, but broke off the relationship after he briefly became a supervillain.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

After Tony undergoes a [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|moral inversion]] following a confrontation with the psychic [[Red Skull]], Pepper attempts to oppose his efforts to release Extremis on a large scale<ref>''Superior Iron Man'' #1</ref> with the aid of an A.I. back-up of Tony's mind he created eight years ago in the event of his mind being attacked in such a manner.<ref>''Superior Iron Man'' #7</ref> Although the A.I. concludes that Tony's mind is irreversibly twisted, and is subsequently destroyed by Tony, Pepper states that she bought one of the largest media companies from under him which she will use to destroy his reputation by broadcasting his plans to the rest of the world. She then proclaims that any attempts he makes to create his 'perfect world' will have to be carried out with people fully aware that he is now nothing but a monster.<ref name="Superior Iron Man #9">''Superior Iron Man'' #9</ref>

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]" brand, Pepper Potts has not been seen in the public life. When Tony Stark (who was no longer inverted) had hired [[Mary Jane Watson]] to work for Stark Industries, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] attempted to recruit Pepper to work for [[Parker Industries]]. Pepper declined the offer.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #12</ref>

Appearing in her Rescue armor following the "[[Civil War II]]" storyline, Pepper Potts confronted [[Riri Williams]] and her Tony Stark A.I. in an attempt to tell Riri the problems of being a superhero only for them to be attacked by Techno Golem and her Biohack Ninjas.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man '' Vol. 3 #3</ref> As Riri flee, Pepper fights against Techno Golem and her Biohack Ninjas as Techno Golem tries to get answers from Pepper on how she knows Riri.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #4</ref> When Techo Golem's armor breaks and Tomoe tries to attack Riri, Pepper fires her Rescue armor's gauntlets at Tomoe which knocked her out. Upon [[Sharon Carter]] formally meeting Riri upon the arrest of Tomoe and the Biohack Ninjas, Pepper states to Riri that they will talk again as she flies off in her Rescue armor.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #5</ref> Pepper Potts was present with Mary Jane Watson, Friday, the Tony Stark A.I., and Tony Stark's biological mother Amanda Armstrong when they are in the Hall of Armor where Riri voices her knowledge of each of the Iron Man armors. When Amanda Armstrong offers to have Riri let Tony Stark's labs be her base of operations, Riri is hesitant as Pepper encourages her.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #6</ref>

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Rescue is among the superheroes that are part of the Underground where she is part of their resistance against Hydra following their takeover of the United States.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1</ref>
