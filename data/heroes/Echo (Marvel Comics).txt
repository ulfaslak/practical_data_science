'''Echo''' ('''Maya Lopez'''), also known as '''[[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[Superhero#Female superheroes|superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has been depicted as a supporting character of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. She makes her first appearance in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' Vol. 2, #9 (Dec. [[1999 in comics|1999]]), and was created by [[David W. Mack|David Mack]] and [[Joe Quesada]]. She is a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and one of the very few [[hearing impairment|deaf]] comic characters.

The "Echo" guise includes a black crop top and a white handprint that covers most of her face.

==Publication history==
The identity of Ronin was an attempt by ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] to create a mystery after the apparently male character was depicted on several comic book covers, including issues of ''New Avengers'', and one ''[[The Pulse (comics)|Pulse]]'' issue. Fan speculation was high, with the most common guess that Ronin was Daredevil (despite Bendis initially denying that this was the case, he eventually revealed this to be the original intention).<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/12/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-159/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #159], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 12, 2008</ref> However, ''Avengers: The Ultimate Guide'', a [[Dorling Kindersley|DK Press]] book, revealed Ronin to be Echo weeks before the slightly delayed release of ''New Avengers'' #13, where Ronin's true identity was belatedly revealed.

While Echo was killed off in 2012 during the Moon Knight series,<ref name="Moon Knight">''Moon Knight'' (vol 4) #9</ref> she is presently set to return in ''Daredevil'' (vol. 5) Annual #1 which was released in August 2016.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/29284-echo-returns-in-august-s-daredevil-annual.html ECHO Returns In August's DAREDEVIL ANNUAL]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:mayalopez1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Maya Lopez. Art by David Mack.]]

While still a young girl, '''Maya Lopez''''s father (known as Willie "Crazy Horse" Lincoln), was killed by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] (Wilson Fisk). As Crazy Horse dies, he leaves a bloody handprint on Maya's face. His last dying wish is that his partner in crime, the Kingpin, raise Maya well: a wish the Kingpin honors, caring for her as his own.

Believed to be mentally disabled, Maya is sent to an expensive school for people with learning disabilities. There, she manages to completely replicate a song on the piano. She is subsequently sent to another expensive school for prodigies. She would soon become a gifted woman.

One day, upon visiting her father's grave with Fisk, Maya asks how he died. Fisk tells her that Daredevil killed him.

===Echo===
Maya is sent by the Kingpin to Matt Murdock to prove Matt's weakness. He tells her that Matt believes he is a bad person, and that she is the only way to prove him wrong. As Maya believes him, it would not appear to be a lie when she tells Matt.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

Matt Murdock and Maya soon fall in love. She later takes on the guise of Echo to hunt down Daredevil. On her face she paints a white handprint, similar to the bloody handprint left by her dying father. Having watched videos of [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and Daredevil fighting, she proves more than a match for Daredevil. After several failed attempts, noticing that Daredevil can easily move through the dark, Maya easily figures out Daredevil's weakness, and exploits this by having him fight in a place where his heightened senses are useless. Maya easily takes him down and nearly kills him, refusing only when she finds out Matt and Daredevil are one and the same. Matt manages to correct the Kingpin's lies. In revenge, Maya confronts Fisk and shoots him in the face, blinding him and starting the chain of events that lead to his eventual downfall (Kingpin would later partially recover his eyesight through reconstructive eye surgery).{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

After realizing the horror of her actions and the lies she has grown up with, Maya flees the United States to do some soul-searching. When she comes back, she tries reuniting with Matt Murdock, only to find out he is now with a blind woman named [[Milla Donovan]], and that the Kingpin is still alive (despite Maya's attempts to kill him). Leaving Matt, Maya visits the Kingpin in prison, who tells her that he doesn't blame her for what she did, and that despite all that had happened, he still loves her like a daughter. Unsatisfied and still needing peace, Maya turns to the Chief, her father's old friend, noted for his wisdom. The Chief sends Maya on a [[Vision quest]] to calm her soul. On her quest, she meets and befriends [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] who helps her recover and passes on his knowledge of Japanese culture and Japanese organized crime. Soon enough, Echo makes peace with her past and is back doing performance art.<ref>''Daredevil'' v2 #51-#55</ref>

===Ronin and the Avengers===
[[File:Echo as Ronin.png|thumb|Echo as Ronin.]] After his recent identity crisis{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} has made him unable to join the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] due to his refusal to tarnish the reputations of heroes such as [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain America]] by working with him, Daredevil recommends Maya to Captain America to aid the Avengers in seizing the [[Silver Samurai]] in [[Japan]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #11</ref> She dons a suit that conceals her identity as well as her gender and rechristens herself ''Ronin''. The word is Japanese for 'Masterless Samurai'.

After joining the Avengers, Maya returns to Japan to keep an eye on [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]], a dangerous assassin rumored to be leading the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], check on the Silver Samurai from time to time, and hopefully solve the conflict between The Hand and Clan Yashida. As Ronin, around the conclusion of the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] between the pro- and anti-registration factions in America, Maya fights Elektra and is killed, but is soon resurrected by the Hand with the same process used to raise Elektra. They take Maya captive with the intent of turning her into an assassin for The Hand. [[Luke Cage]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and the new [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]] rescue her and escape, leaving a furious Elektra to send the Hand after them. During a brief lull in the fight with the Hand, in which Luke Cage tries to negotiate with Elektra to buy time, it is revealed that the Hand has been successful in brainwashing Maya, as she subsequently stabs Dr. Strange with a sword given to her by one of the Hand.<ref>''New Avengers'' #30</ref> She continues to fight the New Avengers until Dr. Strange is able to release his Astral Form, with [[Wong (comics)|Wong]]'s help, and frees Maya from the brainwashing. Maya then charges straight for Elektra, who is fighting Luke Cage, and brutally stabs and slices her with a sword. It is revealed afterwards that Elektra is a [[Skrull]] warrior in disguise.<ref>''New Avengers'' #31</ref> They return to New York, after Spider-Woman's apparent betrayal of them when she steals the corpse of the Skrull Elektra.<ref>''New Avengers'' #32</ref> The Avengers hide in a hotel room, (Strange's magic making it appear that Echo is the only person in the room) before returning to Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum. Echo officially hands the Ronin identity over to Clint Barton after they arrive.<ref>''New Avengers'' #33</ref> After Strange confirms their identities by casting a spell that shows everyone their true nature - Echo appearing dressed in a female variation of Daredevil's costume - the team heads to [[Stark Tower]] to stop the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s attack on the building. There, they encounter the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] locked in battle with an army of invading [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]], one of which latches on to Echo<ref>''New Avengers'' #34</ref> before [[Iron Man]] manages to cure those infected.

===World War Hulk===
Echo attempts to defend [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] from [[Hiroim]] and [[Elloe Kaifi|Elloe]] of the Hulk's Warbound during their attack on the Sanctum Sanctorum to capture Doctor Strange. She, along with Iron Fist and Ronin, is defeated and captured.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #3</ref>

===Avengers/Invaders===
During the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]' appearance in the present due to the manipulations of the villain [[D'Spayre]] after he acquired a [[Cosmic Cube]], Echo proved vital in defeating him as her deafness meant that D'Spayre was unable to manipulate her emotions.<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #8</ref>

===Secret Invasion: The Infiltration===
After the defeat of the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s criminal organization,<ref>''New Avengers'' #37</ref> Echo remains on the team as Doctor Strange departs to the [[astral plane]] to heal himself, setting up base in a building owned by Iron Fist's company but technically leased to [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]] for the year.<ref>''New Avengers'' #38</ref> After a brief run-in with a Skrull disguised as Daredevil, Clint Barton admits being attracted to her, and the two sleep together.<ref>''New Avengers'' #39</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
Echo goes with the rest of the New Avengers to the Savage Land when a Skrull ship crash lands. When the ship opens, it reveals various superheroes in outdated outfits. Echo joins with the Mighty and New Avengers to fight the "old" heroes from the Skrull ship. The battle is then broken up by a dinosaur causing everyone to split up.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #1-2</ref>

Later, she encounters [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], who is actually the [[Veranke|Skrull Queen]] and the force behind the Invasion. "Spider-Woman" incapacitates Echo by repeatedly blasting her with venom blasts and then slams her into a nearby tree trunk.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #3</ref> Echo helps the other Avengers kill all the other Skrull impostors, then heads to New York and confronts an army of Super Skrulls along with various other heroes and villains.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #5-8</ref> She is invited back to Bucky's apartment by Iron Fist but does not show up.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref>

===Heroic Age===
Following the reformation of the New Avengers during the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'', Luke Cage and his wife [[Jessica Jones|Jessica]] seek a nanny for their child. Echo is one of several respondents to the offer, but declines and then angrily asks Cage if he even remembers that she used to be a member of the Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 2) #7</ref>

===Moon Knight===
Echo appeared in the fourth ''[[Moon Knight]]'' series, saving Marc Spector from a [[strip club]] in [[Los Angeles|L.A.]], where she worked undercover under the guise of a [[stripper]]. However, when saving Moon Knight, her cover was blown.<ref>''Moon Knight'' (vol 4) #2</ref> Later Moon Knight proposed that they join forces against the West Coast Kingpin, and invites her to dinner.<ref>''Moon Knight'' (vol 4) #3</ref> Moon Knight is obviously attracted to Echo and it is suggested that Echo feels the same,<ref>''Moon Knight'' (vol 4) #6</ref> despite punching him in the face for kissing her.<ref name="moon-knight-vol-4-num-5">''Moon Knight'' (vol 4) #5</ref> When she meets up with Moon Knight, they get attacked by the Night Shift.<ref name="moon-knight-vol-4-num-4">''Moon Knight'' (vol 4) #4</ref> Although Echo and Moon Knight beat them, the police arrive, and attempt to apprehend the duo as well.<ref name="moon-knight-vol-4-num-5" /><ref name="moon-knight-vol-4-num-4" /> Echo was killed by [[Count Nefaria]], the man trying to become the new West Coast Kingpin.<ref name="Moon Knight"/>

===Resurrection===
Mysterious circumstances later lead to Maya's resurrection. During her first team-up with Daredevil since her return, she helps save New York from a sonic virus created by [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]].<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' (vol. 4) #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Maya Lopez is an Olympic-level athlete possessing "photographic reflexes" or the uncanny ability to perfectly copy other people's movements, similar to that of the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]. Just by watching other people, she has become a concert-level pianist, a strong martial artist, a highly skilled acrobat, and a gifted ballerina (and on one occasion even piloted a Quinjet for a few minutes). In addition, she has also gained Bullseye's uncanny aim and Daredevil's acrobatic abilities after watching tapes of their fights.

Along with great potential, deafness gives Maya Lopez great drawbacks. Her absolute reliance on visual cues renders her helpless in the dark, and her ability to communicate by reading lips prevents her from taking oral commands and communicating with people who are wearing masks or are not in direct visual contact; when she initially meets the Avengers, Captain America has to repeat all of Iron Man's questions for her. However, she has been incorrectly depicted as being able to hear and respond to voices despite not seeing the person's mouth due to standing away from them or the person talking right behind her. It has since been established that Echo actually can read lips from some distance or with the corner of her eye even if the talker is wearing a mask, if the mask is thin enough (as the rather simple fabric masks used by [[Hawkeye (comics)|the new Ronin]] and [[Spider-Man]]), and relay their conversation to closer individuals. She still retains her inability to communicate with people wearing sturdier or thicker masks, or fully covering their mouths.<ref>Avengers/Invaders #5</ref>

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', a woman dressed in Echo's 616 costume appears in a police station shouting "Who can you trust? WHO CAN YOU TRUST?!", referencing Bendis' frequent use of the character in [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and in [[Secret Invasion]] where "Who Can You Trust?" is the major tagline of the event.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Stuart Immonen]] | Inker = Wade von Grawbadger | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Letterer = Cory Petit | Editor = Bill Rosemann, Lauren Sankovitch, Ralph Macchio | Story = The Worst Day In Peter Parker's Life | Title = Ultimate Spider-Man | Volume = 1 | Issue = 122 | Date = July, 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

===Daredevil: End of Days===
Maya appears in ''[[Daredevil: End of Days]]'', now retired from the Avengers and working as a college professor. She is interviewed by [[Ben Urich]] for a story about the death of Matt Murdock.<ref>''Daredevil: End of Days'' #3</ref>
