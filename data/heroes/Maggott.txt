'''Maggott''' ('''Japheth'''), is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was briefly a member of the [[X-Men]].

A flamboyant [[South Africa]]n [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who spoke in exaggerated [[Afrikaans]] [[slang]], Maggott was advertised as one of the strangest X-Men. His digestive system took the form of two [[slug]]s which could eat through practically any substance. After feeding, the slugs reentered Maggott's [[abdomen]] and passed nourishment into him, giving him incredible power.

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Joe Madureira]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #345 (June 1997).

==Fictional character biography==
Maggott was first seen as a mysterious mutant who is searching out the X-Men’s adversary [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] for an unknown reason.<ref>http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/09/15/uncanny-x-men-345-review/ ''Uncanny X-Men #345'' (June 1997)</ref> His search led to [[Antarctica]] where Magneto was holding the X-Men captive. Maggott then joined up with the team and returned with them to their [[Westchester, New York]] headquarters.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

For a short period of time, Maggott believed his companions were going off on their own and killing innocent people. He even tried to turn himself over to the police before being stopped by the X-Men. His companions turned out to be innocent, as the people had been slain by a faction of [[N'Garai]], though they hated to be called so. These entities are a demonic-type race that the X-Men had faced many times, mainly because a regenerating magical portal lies deep in the woods on the mansion's grounds.{{issue|date=March 2013}} A matter which was never resolved was why Maggott's slugs were seemingly related to the N'Garai.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Maggott later was tempted by the entity [[Shadow King]] with promises of a better life in exchange for his loyalty and abandonment of the X-Men. He managed to resist the villain. [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]] and [[Cecilia Reyes]] were also propositioned by the King, but also resisted. [[Psylocke]] then rescues the X-Men after keeping Shadow King in a psionic prison, which forced her in retirement as she could not use her mind powers for anything or else the Shadow King would be released from the prison within Psylocke's mind.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

At first, he kept his past to himself, but Maggott eventually revealed his origin to [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #76 (June 1998)</ref> Maggott had been born a sickly child in [[Apartheid]]-era [[South Africa]] and was named Japheth. He was always very ill and he could not digest solid food. Feeling himself to be a burden on his family, he ran away from home with his younger brother. Having left home, hoping to die, he was found by Magneto who released the slugs from his body and revealed to Japheth his mutant power. This turned his skin blue for the first time, and he named the slugs Eany and Meany. Compassionate at heart, Japheth immediately rejected Magneto's philosophy and his offer to join him after he shortly witnessed later the Master of Magnetism brutally massacre numerous white South African soldiers who were engaged in racist atrocities against black South African civilians (despite the fact that one of these civilians was Japheth's eldest brother who died in the violence). In spite of this, he later sought out Magneto when he got older, for help in easing the pain caused by his unique mutation. After the then-current roster of the team parted ways, the X-Man [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] suggested Maggott transfer to the junior team [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], but his tenure there lasted only one issue and afterwards he fell out of sight. <ref>''Generation X'' Volume 1, No.49, March 1999.</ref>

Maggott reappeared as an inmate at "Neverland," a [[concentration camp]] run by the covert government program [[Weapon X]]. Along with a number of other mutants, he was exterminated there.<ref>''Weapon X'' vol. 2 #5</ref>

One of his slugs, which he gave away to two children at the camp after foreseeing his death (thanks to his psychometric powers) at the camp, was last seen in a container in [[Mister Sinister]]'s laboratory.<ref>''Weapon X'' #14</ref>

Maggott is later resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#Transmode virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants. Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref name ="XMLegacy231">''X-Men: Legacy'' #231, January 2010</ref> Maggott's fate is uncertain as it is unknown if he was among the mutants teleported to [[Genosha]] by [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] to serve as a sacrifice to the newly-deitious Selene or if he was among the mutants that managed to escape Utopia.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Maggott was confirmed to still be alive and powered (though with only one of his slugs) as he was a guest at a superheroes and supervillains-themed costume party of New York branch of the Hellfire Club and was later apparently passed out drunk with other party guests (such as Rocket Raccoon) around an outdoor swimming pool. <ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men Vol. 2'' #10-11</ref>

Most recently, Maggott appeared (along with both of his slugs) along with the other X-Men as part of Cyclops' Million Mutant March in Washington D.C.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #600</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
* Digestive system replaced by a hollow cavity that houses a pair of semi-sentient slugs called Eany and Meany who bore their way out of his torso and then use powerful enzymes to process and digest any solid objects in their path at super speeds, transmitting food energy back to their host to supercharge his physical size, strength, stamina, and sturdiness while turning his skin blue and his eyes red, but the slugs must re-enter through his belly and release their storage internally to feed his body properly.
* Psychometric power enables him to draw psychic imprints from his environment, replaying in his mind's-eye events which once took place or will soon take place in his general vicinity.

==Other versions==
===Age of X===
In the [[Age of X]] alternate reality, Maggott was shown as a prisoner of the prison camp called Camp Gorge. He was killed by that reality's [[Iron Man]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, a version of Maggott made a cameo as a teenage mutant in [[Manhattan]], killed by [[Mister Sinister]] acting on orders from [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #47</ref> An alternate, child version of Maggott later appears in the [[Morlock (comics)|Morlock]] tunnels underneath New York. He and his slug (named Joshua) seek out [[Kitty Pryde]] and her resistance cell after [[Jimmy Hudson]] is injured by [[William Stryker|Reverend Stryker]]'s forces.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #3</ref>
