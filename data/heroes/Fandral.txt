==Fictional character biography==
Fandral is a warrior of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and an adventurer.  He is an irrepressible swashbuckler and romantic. His bravery and optimism often puts the group in highly disadvantageous positions; as perennially pointed out by the gloomy [[Hogun]]. Fandral considers himself the consummate ladies' man and is often depicted with a bevy of young ladies. His actual success with these ladies is intermittent at best, but as such provides numerous opportunities for humorous results. Despite these flaws, he possesses an excessively noble spirit and will do the right thing without thought to his personal safety or prosperity.

Fandral has been involved in a great many adventures and quests, as a member of the [[Warriors Three]], as an ally of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and on his own. Fandral joined in a quest for the power that had cracked the Oversword of Asgard.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #119 (Aug. 1965)</ref> He helped quell a mutiny led by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], despite Loki having been the one to hire Fandral onto the Oversword quest in the first place.<ref name="jim122">''Journey into Mystery'' #122 (Nov. 1965)</ref> He helped repel an attack of the Flying Trolls of Thryheim.<ref name="jim124125">''Journey into Mystery'' #124-125 (Jan. - Feb. 1966)</ref> He helped defeat the forces of Harokin.

Later Fandral was overcome by a mystery plague.<ref name="thor377378">''Thor'' #377-378 (Mar. - Apr. 1987)</ref> He defeated a griffin-like creature.<ref name="thor386">''Thor'' #386 (Dec. 1987)</ref> He helped defend Asgard against the forces of [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]].<ref name="thor393">''Thor'' #393 (July 1988)</ref>

Fandral once set off on a mission to repair mischief done by Loki, and to rescue Mord, a groomsman vital to the security of Asgard. During this, on the Isle of Freya, the Norse Goddess of Love, he learns that his womanizing ways have deeply hurt many women, driving even the latest to near suicide. He is overcome by great shame and declares to Freya, 'for the nonce, I have forsworn philandering'.<ref name="mf36">''Marvel Fanfare'' #36 (Jan. 1988)</ref>

Fandral relates a tale concerning a journey to Earth and his subsequent marriage to a woman named Marian.<ref name="ts18">''Thunderstrike'' #18 (Mar. 1995)</ref>

Once, Thor and the Warriors Three are sent on a quest as penance for accidentally killing an enemy giant during a time of peace: they have to collect sacred items all around the world with the special rule of Thor not being allowed to use his uru hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] in combat. Although the Giants prove to be untrustworthy and not ready to accept the quartet's victory after they've accomplished the tasks, through the use of each warrior's unique capabilities, the adventure eventually comes to a good end.<ref name="thorbo">''Thor: Blood Oath'' #1-6 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006)</ref>

Fandral seemingly perishes early on in the final battle of Ragnarok. The Warriors Three come under arrow attack from the flying ship [[Naglfar]] and Volstagg is the only one of the trio to survive.<ref name="thorv282">''Thor'' vol. 2, #82 (Sept. 2004)</ref> Others who have perished in the same battle, such as Heimdall, have been found alive and well on Earth. Fandral was eventually discovered by Thor in Africa under the human name of Trevor Newley, an Englishman, and restored him to his Asgardian form.<ref name="thorv34">''Thor'' vol. 3, #4 (Dec. 2007)</ref>

Fandral is seen as one of the many defenders of Asgard when it is attacked by Earth's criminal forces.<ref>''Siege'' #1-4 (January 2010 - May 2010)</ref> Fandral and several friends spend time in San Francisco as mortals, pursued by undead cannibals. They are saved by the superhero team called 'The New Mutants'.<ref>''New Mutants'' #42 (May 2012)</ref>

When a younger version of Loki is suspected of betraying his people to the forces of Surtur, Volstagg suggests placing the trickster under arrest. Thor protests, leading directly to him battling the Warriors Three in a non-fatal hand-to-hand battle.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #19 (Nov. 1 2012)</ref> Soon after, with the leadership of the now-Asgardia people in disarray, Fandral accepts the temporary king-ship of Volstagg.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #21 (Dec. 1 2012)</ref>

When Thor vanishes and Mjolnir chooses a female wielder, Hogun and Fandral quest throughout the known galaxy for the Odinson. This is especially important as Odin himself has become irrational. Volstagg chooses to stay behind, having taken on many duties, including the care of Thor's lady love [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], who has become ill.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #3 (Jan. 2016)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Fandral is a member of the race of superhumans known as [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]].  Like all Asgardians, he possesses superhuman strength, speed, agility, stamina, and durability.

Fandral is a master swordsman, and excellent overall battlefield warrior. He is highly proficient in the use of all edged weapons, and his superhuman dexterity, speed, and agility are all significantly greater than the average Asgardian male. Thor himself refers to Fandral as "the best of us with the blade".<ref name="thorbo"/> Like all Asgardians, Fandral's bone, skin and muscle are roughly 3 times denser than a typical human, giving him an extremely high resistance to injury and superhuman strength.

Fandral rides a horse named Firehooves. He can also use the Asgardian Starjammer for transportation.

In the alternate reality of the 1999 miniseries ''[[Earth X]]'', the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]]s were actually aliens that were manipulated by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]s into believing they were the Gods of Norse myth. When the lie was revealed, "Fandral" and the other Asgardians briefly resumed their alien form, but later returned to their Asgardian forms.<ref name="ex12">''[[Earth X]]'' #12 (Apr. 2000).

Also in 2010, a young [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] meets the Warriors Three in ''Thor: The Mighty Avenger''. In this context, Thor is not quite sure of his past or his purpose in life.
