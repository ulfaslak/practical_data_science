'''Deathlok''' (also referred to as '''Deathlok the Demolisher''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #25 (Aug. [[1974 in comics|1974]]), created by [[Rich Buckler]] and [[Doug Moench]]. At least three subsequent Marvel characters have used the "Deathlok" identity since then. A recurring theme among these characters is that a [[undead|dead human]] has been [[reanimated]] with [[cybernetic]] technology.  "Deathlok technology" has also been used thematically by Marvel writers in other stories. The character has also appeared on television in animation and live action. [[J. August Richards]] portrayed him in the [[Television series#Seasons/series|television series]] ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', which is part of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).

==Publication history==
Although initially announced as the new lead feature for Marvel's ''[[Worlds Unknown]]'' comic, under the title "Cyborg",<ref>"Far-Out Fanfare and Infoomation!", ''[[FOOM]]'', November 1973, p. 18</ref> the first Deathlok series ran in  ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #25-28, 30-36 ([[cover-date]]d Aug. 1974 - July 1976). This initial version of the character, '''Luther Manning''', later guest-starred with [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #46 (June 1976), and the story from the cancelled ''Astonishing Tales'' comics was finished in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #33 (April 1977).

Deathlok subsequently appeared with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], a member of the superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]], in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #26, 27, 28, 34 and #54, although one appearance was actually a robot and not the genuine Deathlok. The Luther Manning Deathlok then appeared in ''[[Captain America]]'' #286-288 (Oct.-Dec. 1983).

A new Deathlok, '''Michael Collins''', debuted in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Deathlok'' #1-4 (July-Oct. 1990, reprinted as ''Deathlok Special'' #1-4 the following year). He was the second Deathlok to be created in the modern era and also the second to be created for the traditional [[Marvel Universe]]. This second Deathlok went on to a 34-issue series cover-dated July 1991 to April 1994, plus two [[annual publication|summer annuals]] in 1992 and 1993.

The third Deathlok, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] espionage agent '''Jack Truman''', debuted in an 11-issue limited series (Sept. 1999 - June 2000).

Deathlok has also appeared in four issues of the limited series ''[[Beyond!]]'', and Michael Collins, in human form and not as Deathlok, appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #544-545 (May–June 2007). Multiple unnamed Deathlok units appear in ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' vol. 4, #1-6. Possessing no human sentience, they were automatons created from corpses of soldiers killed in [[Iraq]].

A new Deathlok named '''Henry Hayes''' debuted during the ''[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]'' event from [[Nathan Edmondson]] and [[Mike Perkins]]. While the character was considered to be an adaptation of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] portrayal of Deathlok, Mike Petersen, Edmondson stated that the coincidences were just "happy similarities" and that ultimately they tried to go for a total original concept.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/21378-writer-promises-new-old-deathlok-in-new-ongoing-series.html|title=Writer Promises New & Old DEATHLOK In New Ongoing Series|website=Newsarama|last=Arrant|first=Chris|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref> This Deathlok has his own ongoing series that began in October 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/50984/deathlok_2014_1|title=Deathlok (2014) #1|author=|date=|website=marvel.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Luther Manning===
Colonel Luther Manning is an American soldier from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], who, after being fatally injured, is reanimated in a post-apocalyptic future (originally given the date of 1990) only to discover that what remains of his dead body has been turned into the experimental Deathlok [[cyborg]] by Simon Ryker. He verbally communicates with his symbiotic computer, to which he refers as the abbreviated "'Puter". He escapes from Ryker's control,<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #25 (Aug. 1974)</ref> although he dreams he has regained his humanity.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #4 (Sept. 1982)</ref> He battles the evil corporate and military regimes that have taken over the [[United States]], while simultaneously struggling not to lose his humanity. He battles Simon Ryker and the first [[Warwolf (Marvel Comics)|War-Wolf]], and encounters his wife and son for the first time after becoming a cyborg.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #26-27 (Oct. & Dec. 1974)</ref> He battles Simon Ryker's Super-Tank,<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #28, 30 (Feb. & June 1975)</ref> and then begins a hunt for a "cyborg doctor".<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #32 (Nov. 1975)</ref> He battles Simon Ryker as the Savior Machine, and his mind is ultimately transferred into a Luther Manning clone.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #33-35 (Jan.-May 1976)</ref> He battles mutants alongside a time-traveling [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #46 (June 1976)</ref> He begins working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], encounters Godwulf for the first time, and is then finally sent back in time to the modern era.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #36 (July 1976); final issue of the series</ref>

He battles the [[Devil-Slayer]], but then battles demons alongside Devil-Slayer.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #33 (April 1977)</ref> He later becomes controlled by [[Mentallo]] and the [[Fixer (comics)#Fixer/Techno|Fixer]] and is sent to assassinate the President, but is stopped by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #26-27 (April–May 1977)</ref>  After his capture he becomes catatonic, and is taken to England for treatment by the Thing.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #28 (June 1977)</ref> He is cured by Louis Knort, and Nick Fury takes him into custody.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #54 (Aug. 1979)</ref>

Deathlok is rebuilt by [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]] as a robot and sent to sabotage [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Government agencies|Project Pegasus]]. The robot battles the Thing and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], and self-destructs.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #54</ref> The real Deathlok, now working for the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]], battles [[Captain America]] and a time-traveling Luther Manning clone.  Alongside Captain America, Godwulf, and the Redeemers, he battles Hellinger.<ref>''Captain America'' #286-288</ref>

Some time later, the [[Earth-616|"mainstream timeline"]] Luther Manning begins dreaming that he is Deathlok.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #25-26</ref> He is charged with temporal energy by Timestream.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #27</ref> Timestream recruits this "mainstream" human Manning.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #29</ref> Deathlok, Timestream, and Manning battled the Collins Deathlok, [[Siege (John Kelly)|Siege]], and Godwulf.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #31-34</ref>

The Manning Deathlok eventually returns to his own time and overthrows the megalomaniac who had taken over the country. Manning remains in his near-future alternate reality, searching for a purpose in life and unable to disconnect himself from the machine bonded to him.

Eventually, Manning travels to the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]] and encounters [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. He lives a life of solitude until being apprehended by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], from which he is later kidnapped by the supervillain [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] and, immobilized, put up for auction as a weapon. Before a sale can be completed, he is stolen by the crime lord [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] and sent on a [[kamikaze]] decoy run.

===John Kelly===
Kelly first appeared as Deathlok in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #62. This version of Deathlok was originally controlled by Kelly until its systems determined that Kelly's brain function was detrimental to its completion of the "First Run" program. The Deathlok unit then completed its mission. Kelly's brain was removed from the cyborg and disposed of. One of Ryker's assistants took the brain presumably for use in the SIEGE unit. This version was made for the [[United States Army]] by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s Deathlok-program co-head, Harlan Ryker, after studying Luther Manning's cyborg body. The Kelly Deathlok later became known as [[Siege (John Kelly)|Siege]].<ref>Wright, Gregory; ''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #19 (Jan. 1993)</ref>

===Michael Collins===
Professor Michael Collins was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  He was a pacifist working for the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]] cybernetics corporation Cybertek. Upon discovery of the Deathlok program he was shot with a sedative by Harlan Ryker and his brain was transplanted into the body of the [[Siege (John Kelly)|John Kelly]] Deathlok Cyborg. The machine was used against rebels fighting against Roxxon's influence in the fictional South American country of Estrella. Collins regained his consciousness during that mission and stopped the cyborg programming that would have killed a small child.

Although his brain was intended to serve only as a medium for the robot's programming, he was able to assert his will over it (installing a "no-killing parameter" into its programming).<ref name=one>''Deathlok''  #1 (July 1990)</ref> The computer is fully willing to listen to Collins, though he must take care to present his orders in a way that helps fulfill the mission and keep people from dying. The computer is fully capable of understanding distinct concepts, such as bluffing, as when Collins is forced to pretend to take a hostage.

He met Jesus Badalamente and also battles Mainframe.<ref>''Deathlok'' #2 (Aug. 1991)</ref>

Collins learns that his human body was still alive, and encounters [[Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Deathlok'' #3</ref> Harlan Ryker hides Collins's human body. Collins aids Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. in preventing a nuclear strike on the United States.<ref name=one />

With the [[Fantastic Four]], [[X-Men]], and [[Misty Knight]], Deathlok later battles Mechadoom.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #2-5 (Aug.-Nov. 1991)</ref> He meets the [[Punisher]], and battles [[Silvermane]].<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #6-7 (Dec. 1991 - Jan. 1992)</ref> After that he teams up with [[Spider-Man]] and several other heroes to stop the [[Sinister Six]].<ref>''Spider-Man'' #18-23 (Jan. 1992 - Jun. 1992)</ref> He next meets [[Moses Magnum]].<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #11 (May 1992)</ref> Collins finally reveals his existence as a cyborg to his family.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #12 (June 1992)</ref>

Collins then begins to search for his human body. During this time he fought [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]],<ref>''Sleepwalker'' #8 (January 1992)</ref> and helps [[Silver Sable]] retrieve a purloined Statue of Liberty.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' # 6 & 7 (November & December 1992)</ref> He assists a makeshift team of other heroes in the "[[Maximum Carnage]]" incident, protecting the people of New York from a mass-murdering group of supervillains.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #379 & 380, ''Spider-Man'' #36 & 37, ''Web of Spider-Man'' #103 & ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #203 (July & August 1993)</ref>

During the events of the series ''[[Beyond!]]'', the cosmic being [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] (pretending to be the [[Beyonder]]) transported Collins to an alien planet where he was forced to live for years until being rescued with the aid of several other heroes. However, his rescue required the sacrifice of Greg Willis, the superhero known as [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]]. As an act of gratitude, Collins arranged Gravity's funeral.<ref>McDuffie, Dwayne ''[[Beyond!]]'' #s 2-6 (July-Dec. 2006)</ref>  When Willis' body was later stolen by the cosmic entity known as Epoch, Collins enlisted the aid of the [[Fantastic Four]] in retrieving it.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #544-546 (May–July 2007)</ref>

===Jack Truman/Larry Young===
Jack Truman was an agent of the international espionage outfit [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who was transformed into a cyborg to battle the [[Red Skull]]. Through telepathic means, he eventually swapped his mind into the body of another former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, '''Larry Young'''. Young is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] program.<ref>[[Anthony Flamini|Flamini, Anthony]] & Byrd, Ronald; ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''; March 2007; Page 62</ref>

===Project: Deathlok===
During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, a [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] strikeforce consisting of corpses animated with crude bionics was sent to capture a super-soldier research center known as "[[Weapon Plus|The World]]". These models acted like traditional zombies, craving brains. Their mission was unsuccessful, and as a result, the research group which produced them, "Project: Deathlok", was scrapped.<ref>''Dark Reign The List: Wolverine'' #1</ref>

===Deathlok Prime===
[[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s rogue ops team joins an alternate future Deathlok-Prime - now free from its homicidal human host's brain - to face down invaders from a different possible future where X-Force, and all other superheroes, have been turned into "Deathloks" controlled by worldly authorities with popular support, which produces a crime-free [[utopia]] for everyone else.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #5, 6, 7</ref>

Deathlok appeared later as a guest speaker for one of Jean Grey School for Higher Learning's classes.  Deathlok revealed the potential futures of the students present and the probabilities of them occurring. Notably, Deathlok refused to comment on Genesis' future, revealing to him in private that only he can choose his fate.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #4, March 2012</ref>

===Death Locket===
{{Main|Death Locket}}
In the ''[[Avengers Arena]]'' series as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, a female teenage version of Deathlok dubbed Death Locket is introduced. She is revealed to be Rebecca Ryker, the daughter of Harlan Ryker. After being maimed in an explosion that killed her mother and brother, Rebecca was rebuilt using the Deathlok technology that her father developed.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #2</ref> [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] later kidnaps her alongside the students of the [[Avengers Academy]] and Braddock Academy and forces them to fight other teenage superhumans in his latest version of Murderworld.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #1</ref>

===Henry Hayes===
A new Deathlok debuted during the ''[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]'' storyline. Henry Hayes worked at [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]]. During his duty, he lost a leg in a suicide bomber attack in Kandahar (or was brainwashed into thinking he did), Henry was taken care of by the company Biotek who provided him with a composite fiber prosthesis. Upon being placed under mind-control, Henry Hayes became Deathlok where he was used as an assassin, a soldier, a killer, a fighter, and an operative. He had participated in at least one armed conflict alongside organized troops, and assassinated countless people even in populated areas. He was even once close to being captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. when a mission went bad in Russia. Henry Hayes was often memory-wiped and did not remember his assignments. While at MTA Metro-North station, he tried to engage discussion with another leg amputee and advised him to contact Biotek, as his own prosthesis (plastic ones as it was the only his pension afforded him) forced the man to use crutches. This man left, seemingly displeased with the discussion. Immediately afterward, he met Seth Horne, an off duty S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who was present when the Eye of the Watcher exploded, releasing a blast of energy which revealed deep secrets to anyone in its radius. To Horne it revealed Hayes' true story. This level four agent wanted to congratulate him, stating that S.H.I.E.L.D. would wish to have him in their ranks. As Henry Hayes really did not know what Horne was talking about, he threatened to call the authorities forcing the agent to leave after a last congratulations. Immediately, Henry Hayes was ordered to kill him as the announcement board of the station indicated the words "Whiskey David" triggering Henry Hayes' Deathlok persona. After following Seth Horne into the restroom Deathlok quickly executed him, left, took some medications, and returned to his civilian life heading to the train to join his daughter Aria.<ref>''Original Sins'' #1</ref>

===Jemma Simmons===
{{Main|Jemma Simmons (comics)}}
In the ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' comic book, Jemma Simmons (based on the character from [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|TV show of the same name]]) became the newest Deathlok, though she has yet to actually take the name. She becomes one after getting infected with an unknown substance contained within a "targeted DNA bomb" that begins to deteriorate her condition which also placed her in a coma. With the help of Henry Hayes and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]], she is transformed into a Deathlok which successfully saves her life.<ref>''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #10</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}

===Manning===
Col. Luther Manning's body was rebuilt into a cyborg body by Harlan Ryker. Deathlok's mechanical, cybernetic physiology granted him several superhuman powers including superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and a computer augmented brain. The right arm and left half of his face are armored cybernetic implants. He wears a woven metal-mesh body suit of considerable durability. Deathlok also carried a helium-neon laser pistol designed by the U.S. Army of his time, and a throwing dagger.

Manning was a military academy graduate, and a brilliant military strategist. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, and proficient with knives, daggers, handguns, and laser pistols.

He was later captured and upgraded by 616's S.H.I.E.L.D. and given jet boots that allowed him to leap at great heights and his other abilities were perhaps enhanced to greater levels.

===Collins===
Michael Collins' human brain was transplanted into a cyborg body by a group of scientists at Cybertek. His cyborg body grants him the same powers as Manning, only with much greater strength, speed, and resistance to injury. He possesses a broad spectrum of visual and auditory powers. Deathlok has the ability to interface with virtually any computer system. He is also able to project his consciousness and sensory projections directly into the Net, making him capable of directly hacking computer systems far more efficiently than a traditional hacker. His body can also target (nearly infallibly) multiple objects and track them. He could scan the entire electromagnetic spectrum, as well as enter computer systems. He has learned to use internal nano-bots to repair and alter both his organic and inorganic parts, enabling him to appear as either a humanoid cyborg, or completely human.

He also has a very sophisticated A.I., capable of quickly making complex strategies and evaluating their chance of success. If requested, the A.I. can take control of the body to perform these operations. Collins himself possesses no combat skills, but under computer-guided combat routines, he is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with an extensive database of combat techniques and strategies.

Collins is an excellent computer programmer with an advanced degree in computer science and prosthetics, and helped construct the Deathlok body, along with other Cybertek scientists including William Hansen, Ben Jacobs, Stanley Cross, Dr. Hu, and Jim Dworman.  After becoming Deathlok, Collins later modified his own systems.

Like Manning, Collins wears a woven metal-mesh body suit of considerable durability. He carries a plasma pistol which draws its energy from his internal power source. Thus, the weapon can only be fired if in contact with the outlets in Deathlok's hand. Deathlok also possesses a collapsible plasma rifle capable of greater firepower with the same limitations, a supply of fragmentation plasma grenades, and a molybdenum steel knife. He wears a wrist bracelet that allows Deathlok to override similar cybernetic operating systems, and an [[adamantium]]/[[vibranium]] alloy shock dampening helmet. He sometimes uses a refitted Cybertek Dragonfly fighter with a range of several hundred miles.

==Other versions==
===Mutant X===
In the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' reality, Deathlok is a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Mutant X'' #1</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #70 (Feb. 2005), the [[Ultimates]] fight a person they refer to as Luther Manning, who looks like Deathlok and whom [[Spider-Man]] describes as a "half-robot half-zombie guy". The superheroes take him into custody.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #70</ref>

===X-Factor===
In ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #231 (Apr. 2012), in a version of reality where [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]] declared "no more humans" instead of "no more mutants", Tony Stark is attacked by a mostly-cyborg version of Steve Rogers, who refers to himself as Deathlok.<ref>''X-Factor'' #231</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* In an episode of ''[[Black Panther (TV series)|Black Panther]]'', a team of Deathloks are sent to "assist" Wakanda from an invasion by a neighboring country backed by [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] and his allies with the true objective to coerce or otherwise foster a regime friendly to an American agenda. They arrive in time, but are sent back by the Black Panther.
* The Deathlok concept is adapted for the television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', which is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

* A variation of Deathlok appears in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Deathlok", voiced by [[Mark Hildreth (actor)|Mark Hildreth]].<ref name="Deathlok">{{cite episode|title=Deathlok|series=Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=21|airdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref> In this show, Deathlok is a cyborg from the future in which the Skrulls' plan for Earth succeeded and Deathlok was one of the few remaining humans left. He was turned into a cyborg and sent to the present, but he cannot return to his own time. He teleports into a mall where he targets a woman only to end up fighting the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. where Deathlok claims that she is no girl. She-Hulk discovers that Deathlok was right about the girl who happens to be [[Super-Skrull]] in disguise as the other people in the mall are revealed to be Skrulls preparing for the Skrull invasion of Earth. Deathlok tells the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. that this date on Earth would be the day when the Skrulls eradicate the human race and terraform Earth to settle on it. After Hulk defeats Super-Skrull, Deathlok activates his self-destruct as She-Hulk takes out Deathlok's core which destroys the ship. She-Hulk was able to put a new core made by Iron Man into Deathlok where the mall flier was part of Deathlok's way to inform the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. about the Skrulls' plot. In the episode "Planet Monster" Pt. 2, Deathlok is among the superheroes that help the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and the Avengers in their fight against the forces of the [[Supreme Intelligence]].

===Film===
