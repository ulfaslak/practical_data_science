'''Monica Rambeau''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] and [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Initially known as '''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)#Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]]''', the character joined and eventually became leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for a time. She later used the codenames '''Photon''', '''Pulsar''', and beginning in 2013, '''Spectrum'''.

The character makes her cinematic debut in ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' played by Akira Akbar.

==Publication history==
The character, created by writer [[Roger Stern]] and artist [[John Romita Jr.]], first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man Annual]]'' #16 (October 1982).

Talking about the visual features of the character, Romita noted that, originally, the character was intended to look like actress [[Pam Grier]], but her appearance was changed before publication:

{{quote|I just took some reference on Pam Grier, because I always loved her, and at the last moment somebody said that, "Well, we need to use this woman, here," because they thought maybe Pam Grier wasn't as good-looking as the model they found. It was fine, because by the time she got done by other artists, it ended up looking like the generic black character, anyway.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nolen-Weathington|first= Eric |author2=George Khoury|title=Modern Masters Volume 18: John Romita Jr.|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location=[[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]]| isbn=978-1-893905-95-5 |page=126}}</ref>}}

After her debut, the character appeared throughout the entirety of Stern's five-year run on ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]'', ultimately becoming the team's leader, and later made numerous appearances as a reserve member after her departure from active duty. Still later, she received two [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] titles, both written by [[Dwayne McDuffie]] and illustrated by [[Mark D. Bright]]. She also starred in ''Avengers: Unplugged'' #5. She returned in ''The Avengers'' vol. 3 with sporadic appearances between issues #1-59. During this run, she also appeared in ''Avengers: Infinity'' #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2000), ''[[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]]'' #2-3 (both Jan. 2001), ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' vol. 2 #30 (Jan. 2001) and the ''Avengers Annual'' in 2001.

In 2009, Rambeau appeared in the limited series, ''[[Marvel Divas]]'' (partly inspired by ''[[Sex and the City]]'').<ref name="marveldivas">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960|title=MyCup o' Joe Tea, Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning|date=2009-04-09|publisher=MySpace Comic Books|accessdate=2009-04-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413195242/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960|archivedate=2009-04-13|df=}}</ref> She was one of the main characters, alongside [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Monica Rambeau was born in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] to Frank and [[Maria Rambeau]]. She was a lieutenant in the New Orleans harbor patrol, and operated as a cargo ship captain. Trying to prevent the creation of a dangerous weapon, Rambeau was exposed to extra-dimensional energy. As a result, she was thereafter able to convert her body to energy. After this event, the media dubbed her "Captain Marvel". She decided to use her powers to fight crime under that name, but was later told by [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]] that the name had originally been used by the late [[Kree]] hero [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]]. Grimm assured her that "Marv wouldn't mind. I probably ain't the only 'Thing' in the world either."<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #16</ref>

===Joining the Avengers===
Rambeau sought out the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for help in mastering her new powers and became a member-in-training,<ref>''Avengers'' #227</ref> soon aiding them against [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]].<ref>''Avengers'' #229-230 (March–April 1983)</ref> Befriended and mentored by Avengers veterans [[Captain America]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], Captain Marvel soon graduated to full membership after the battle against [[Plantman]].<ref>''Avengers'' #231</ref> She became their first African-American heroine.{{issue|date=January 2018}}

She assisted [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] in battling [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #60</ref>

Two of Rambeau's enemies are super-powered psychiatrist [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] (Karla Sofen), and Moonstone's powerful pawn [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]] (Marcus Daniels), who wields the Darkforce. Captain Marvel first encountered them when the Avengers opposed the duo's escape from incarceration in [[Project Pegasus|Project: PEGASUS]]. After that, Rambeau temporarily lost her ability to transform back to human form during a battle against Dr. Eric Paulson, in which she fought alongside Spider-Man and Starfox.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #142–143</ref> She was with the team when the Beyonder abducted them and other Earth superheroes for the first Secret Wars saga.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #1 (May 1984)</ref>

Moonstone and Blackout returned as members of [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron (Helmut) Zemo's]] [[Masters of Evil]], participating in an occupation of [[Avengers Mansion]] and trapping Rambeau in the Darkforce dimension. With help from The Shroud, Rambeau was able to escape in time to help retake the Mansion. During the battle, Moonstone was crippled and Blackout died.<ref>''Avengers'' #273-277 (Nov. 1986 - March 1987)</ref> Another of Rambeau's major early foes was the murderous interstellar pirate [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], who shanghaied Rambeau into space for an extended period before she reunited with the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #257-260 (July–Oct. 1985)</ref>

Captain Marvel also took part in battles against the [[Beyonder]],<ref>''Avengers'', #261,265-266</ref> a confused [[Jean Grey]],<ref>''Avengers'' #263</ref> [[Kang the Conqueror]],<ref>''Avengers'' #267-269</ref> [[Attuma]],<ref>''Avengers'' 272</ref> and [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #2; ''Avengers Annual'' #16</ref>

===Leader of the Avengers===
Rambeau later replaced the Wasp as leader of the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers'' #279 (May 1987)</ref> commanding them in battles against the [[X-Men]],<ref>X-Men Vs. Avengers #1-4</ref> the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian Gods]],<ref>''Avengers'' #281-285</ref> and the [[Super-Adaptoid]].<ref>''Avengers'' 286-290</ref> She spent a lot of time refereeing squabbles between Hercules and the Submariner, and dealing with the duplicitous telepath Dr. Druid, who sought to supplant her as Avengers chairman and undermined her authority at every opportunity.

When honorary Avengers member and wife of the Submariner [[Marrina Smallwood|Marrina]] transformed into the gigantic sea monster Leviathan, Captain Marvel led the hunt for the creature. During the battle that followed, Rambeau transformed herself into a massive bolt of lightning to try and stop the beast. She made contact with the water and accidentally conducted herself across the surface of the ocean, dispersing her atoms so widely that she barely regained physical form. She reformed as a frail, withered husk of a woman devoid of super-powers.<ref name=AV293>''Avengers'' #291-293 (1988)</ref>

===Regaining her powers===
After retiring from the team,<ref>''Avengers'' #294 (Aug. 1988)</ref> Rambeau regained first her physical health, and eventually her powers, initially developing the ability to manipulate mechanical energy for various effects.<ref name="CM3 1"/> She resumed crimefighting, facing foes such as Brazilian crime lord Kristina Ramos, Moonstone, and [[Powderkeg]].<ref name="CM3 1"/> At the same time, she served as a cargo ship captain in her friend Ron Morgan's shipping company before starting her own charter business.<ref name="CM3 1"/>

Rambeau stayed connected with the Avengers and served as a reservist, sometimes assuming leadership duties in the absence of the current chair. She helped repel an [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] invasion of the surface world<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #18 (1989), [[Atlantis Attacks]]</ref> and assists in the [[Acts of Vengeance]], which involved a concentrated, multi-villain attack on Earth's superheroes,<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #27 (Dec. 1989), ''Avengers Annual'' #19 (1990)</ref> or in the [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus Factor]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' Vol 1 19</ref> Rambeau led a reserve substitute roster during the team's first United Nations-backed reorganization.<ref>''Avengers'' #329 & 330 (Feb.-March 1991)</ref> She took on another leadership role during the [[Operation: Galactic Storm|Kree-Shi'ar war]] and led an Avengers delegation to the Shi'ar Empire to petition for peace.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

When a group of aliens calling themselves Starblasters tried to push the moon away from Earth, [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] assembled a team with some of the most powerful heroes of the world, recruiting Rambeau, [[Carol Danvers]], [[Black Bolt]], [[Hyperion (comics)#Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Hyperion]], [[Ikaris (comics)|Ikaris]], [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]] and  [[Perun (comics)|Perun]]. During this adventure, her original powers gradually regenerated, fully returning when the alien [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] accelerates the process.<ref>''Quasar'' #55-58</ref>

When [[Genis-Vell|Genis]] became an adventurer, he was known as Captain Marvel like his father before him—which Rambeau resented. After she, [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]] and Genis teamed up to defeat the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]], Genis tried to concede the Captain Marvel title to Rambeau since he felt she was more worthy of it. Rambeau declined out of respect for the Mar-Vell legacy and adopted a new alias: Photon.<ref>''[[Avengers Unplugged]]'' #5 (June 1996)</ref>

===Avengers Return===
After the return of the main avengers from the [[Heroes Return|pocket universe]] created by [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] almost all the current and former Avengers members were trapped in a curse created by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] where they served her as soldiers in a guard called Queen's Vengeance.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #1-3</ref> Due to her strong loyalty to the group Rambeau, under the name Daystar, was one of the first Avengers to recover their will and rebel against the sorceress.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #2</ref>

Later when Photon was attacked by the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] in the [[Mardi Gras]] of New Orleans, she asked the Avengers for help and wound up being involved in an adventure in [[Arkon]]'s world with the group and her old fellow Avenger, [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #16-18</ref>

For a time, Rambeau's mother intercepted her Avengers calls out of fear for her daughter's safety. After discovering this deception, Rambeau led an unofficial force of Avengers against the 'Infinites', who planned on relocating the galaxy.<ref>''Avengers Infinity'' #1-4 (September–December 2000)</ref> Next Photon was involved in the events of [[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]],<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #35</ref> and fought with her former teammates against [[Bloodwraith]], and [[Triune Understanding|Lord Templar and Pagan]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #36-37</ref>

After that, Rambeau helped the team in the deep-space monitoring station with [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] and [[Living Lightning]],<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #38</ref> called into action in [[Kang Dynasty|Kang's War]],<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #46-55</ref> (supporting also her friend [[Janet Van Dyne]] and advising the new recruit [[Delroy Garrett|Triathlon]] on his current issues as the newest member of the team),<ref>''Avengers Annual'' 2001</ref> in the world crisis caused by [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]],<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #58-59</ref> and when the [[Scarlet Witch]] suffered a nervous breakdown and attacked the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #501-503 (October–December 2004)</ref>

===From Pulsar to Nextwave===
When Genis-Vell wanted to establish a new identity for himself, he began calling himself Photon. Rambeau confronted him, but she decided to let Genis keep the Photon alias after she came up with a name she liked better: Pulsar.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #9 (August 2005)</ref>

Rambeau later led the [[Nextwave]] team, part of the [[H.A.T.E.|Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort]] (H.A.T.E.), against Unusual Weapons of Mass Destruction created by the [[Beyond Corporation©]]<ref>''Nextwave'' #1 (March 2006)</ref> where she avoided using a code name and wore a new uniform.

During the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhero Civil War]], Rambeau was a member of [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers and registered as a member of the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]].<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]''</ref><ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>

When Brother Voodoo asked for Rambeau's help in tracking down some evil sorcerers, she revealed a former relationship with [[Brother Voodoo]] to [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]]. Despite her breaking it off, Voodoo still had feelings for Rambeau. She agreed to aid him, rekindling their relationship in the process.<ref>''Marvel Divas'' #1-4</ref>

She later attended [[Emma Frost]]'s birthday party in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] where she helped solve a cosmic crisis involving [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Frankie Raye]].<ref>''Heralds'' #1-5</ref>

The group continued to meet partly over their support of Firestar, who had battled and defeated breast cancer.<ref>''Young Allies'' #1-6 (2010)</ref> She assisted [[Carol Danvers]], in an investigation in the Gulf of Mexico, where Rambeau indicated that she was still fearful of using her powers under the water since her traumatic experience in battle against [[Marrina Smallwood]],<ref name="Captain Marvel 2012"/> and aided [[Iron Man]] in the Avengers' deep-space monitoring station against ancient Viking monsters who claimed to be the Emperor of Mars.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #649 (April 2013)</ref>

===Marvel Now!===
During the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Monica Rambeau took the name of Spectrum as she chased after the criminal [[Blue Streak (comics)|Blue Streak]]. Even the police officers that arrested him were impressed by her latest alias and her new costume. Spectrum returned to a specialist shop in New York where a man named Luc sells designer superhero costumes. He mentioned that someone was waiting for her in the next room. Monica recognized the man, though apparently all he wanted to do was talk and ask for help. Spectrum heard the explosions when [[Proxima Midnight]] began her attack on the city. Her [[Blade (comics)|mysterious guest]] says he cannot be seen in America, and needed her help for a mysterious mission, but she was adamant...he is in a costume shop, and if he wanted her help, he'd put on a costume and come help her.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

Monica became field leader of Luke Cage's new [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] team in the wake of the event.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 2 #4</ref>

During the "Last Days" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Spectrum devised a plan to destroy Earth-1610 to keep it from colliding with Earth-616. In desperation during the two weeks before the end of the world, Spectrum channeled her full power and went to destroy Earth-1610.<ref>''Captain America and the Mighty Avengers'' #8</ref> However, right before she could successfully destroy the other Earth, she spotted a group of children who lived there, causing her to hesitate for only a moment, long enough for Ultimate Reed Richards to capture her.<ref>''Captain America and the Mighty Avengers'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Due to bombardment by extra-dimensional energies, Rambeau can transform herself into any form of energy within the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Among the many energy forms she has assumed and is able to control are [[cosmic ray]]s, [[gamma ray]]s, [[X-ray]]s, [[ultraviolet]] radiation, visible light, electricity, [[infrared]] radiation, [[microwave]]s, [[radio waves]], and [[neutrino]]s. By assuming an energy-form, she gains all of that energy's properties.

She is invisible and intangible in many of her energy forms (the most frequent exception being visible light), and is capable of flight in all her energy forms (reaching velocities up to and including light speed). She also has the ability to project these energies from her body while she is in human form (only one wavelength of energy at a time), usually in the form of energy blasts from her hands. She mentally controls both the type and quantity of energy she wishes to transmit. The maximum amount of energy she can transmit at a given time is unknown. Rambeau can also divert small amounts of various energies for employment as force beams, which have the equivalent to 300 tons of TNT of explosive force. A variation of this ability enables her to project light-based [[holograph]]ic illusions of herself. Rambeau has also shown the ability to split her energy form into several miniature energy forms that are under her mental command, each miniature Rambeau is able to react and fly at light-speed.

When she encounters a new or unfamiliar energy, Rambeau can often duplicate it given enough time for analysis.<ref>''Avengers/JLA'' #2</ref> Rambeau tends to be physically insubstantial in her energy forms, though with concentration and effort she can sometimes perform tasks such as briefly grasping an object, either by partially solidifying or by applying some sort of force to the object in question.

When Rambeau temporarily lost her original powers after a massive energy expenditure,<ref name=AV293/> she developed the ability to shunt any mechanical energy directed towards her through a dimensional interface surrounding her body, granting her increased strength, resistance to impact, and the ability to fly. After Rambeau asked [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] to examine these new abilities, he theorized that she accessed the same dimension from which she derived her energy powers to create the interface.<ref name="CM3 1">''Captain Marvel'' vol. 3, #1 (Nov. 1989)</ref>

Rambeau has strong leadership skills and law enforcement experience due to both of her time as a police officer and former leader of the Avengers. She is an excellent markswoman, unarmed combatant, detective, and swimmer with extensive nautical expertise. She has received Harbor Patrol training, and Avengers training in unarmed combat by Captain America.

===Limitations===
Rambeau is able to retain her energy form for several hours with no ill effects.<ref>''The Avengers'' #253</ref> She can only transform herself into one wavelength of energy at a time, but she can transform between one energy-state and another in a fraction of a second. Extensive energy transformation and manipulation can be physically taxing once she re-assumes her physical form. Rambeau can also be forcibly reverted to her original form by other forces.<ref>''The Avengers'' #263 (Jan. 1986)</ref>

==Other versions==

===Age of Ultron===
During the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, Rambeau appears amongst the superhero resistance against Ultron.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #2-5</ref>

===Earth-A===
Like other inhabitants of this reality, Monica Rambeau would periodically visit [[Earth-616]] for vacations. Due to the nature of the interdimensional travel, she received duplicate powers to her counterpart and would masquerade as her. It is implied that the inexperienced Rambeau appearing around that time in ''Black Panther'' was, in fact, this alternate. Rambeau claimed that the main reason she visited Earth-616 was not because she would gain superpowers but because her parents were still alive in that reality.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol.4, #21</ref>

===Forever Yesterday===
Monica Rambeau is featured in ''[[New Warriors]]'' #11–13, in an alternate reality that is listed as Earth-9105, where she goes under the code-name of Sceptre. She is part of a murderous version of the Avengers, who enforce the will of the tyrannical female [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]].{{issue|date=September 2011}} She briefly makes an appearance in ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' #11–12 when she and several other alternate, evil Avengers are brought forth in order to battle the main protagonists.

===''JLA/Avengers''===
Photon is shown as a reservist member of the Avengers and aids them during the searching of the twelve items of power, fighting against the [[Green Lantern]].<ref>Avengers/JLA #2</ref> After the battle for the last item in the [[Savage Land]], Monica takes part in one annual JLA-Avengers meeting at the [[Justice League Satellite]] in the new merged world that the villain [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] created, being unaware of the changes.<ref>Avengers/JLA #3</ref> After that she appeared fighting along with other Captain Marvels of both universes  ([[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam!]]) in the final battle.<ref>''Avengers/JLA'' #4 (May 2004)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
Monica Rambeau appears in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' issue #3 in her [[Nextwave]] uniform, fighting alongside the rest of the team against a zombified [[Power Pack]].<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' #3</ref>

===MC2===
Although Monica Rambeau has never appeared in Marvel Comics' future-era [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] line, the comics feature her daughter by Derek Freeman, [[Blacklight (MC2)|Blacklight]], who first appears in ''[[A-Next]]'' #9.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicboards.com/spidergirl/view.php?rpl=000705170607 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024513/http://www.comicboards.com/spidergirl/view.php?rpl=000705170607 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref>
