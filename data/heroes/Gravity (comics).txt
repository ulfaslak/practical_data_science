==Fictional character biography==
Greg Willis was born and raised in [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], [[Wisconsin]]. During the summer after his high school graduation, while on board his family's yacht, Greg is sucked into a mysterious black hole. He is found hours later by his parents, unharmed. After the incident, Greg finds that he is able to manipulate the gravitational force around his body and nearby objects.<ref>''Gravity'' #5 (2005)</ref> Looking to take advantage of his new powers, Greg moves east to [[New York City]] to study licensing and merchandising at [[New York University]], and becomes a marketable member of the superhero community known as Gravity.<ref>''Gravity'' #1 (2005)</ref>

On his first outing, Gravity encounters a battle between [[Rage (comics)|Rage]] and [[Black Death (comics)|Black Death]]. Unfortunately, Gravity accidentally mistakes Rage as a villain and allows [[Black Death (comics)|Black Death]] to escape. His confidence begins to waver as life as a superhero proves tougher than he expects. But after he saves the life of a frail old woman, and meets new friends Lauren Singh and Frog, Gravity slowly becomes more confident in his double identity. His later battles prove to be more fruitful, defeating the likes of [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]]. However, Black Death takes a special interest in Gravity, appearing numerous times to humiliate the new hero. Black Death then masquerades as a hero known as the Greenwich Guardian (Black Death's identity before he becomes a supervillain) to further break Gravity's confidence and use him in a plot to destroy the university. Ultimately, his resolve is too strong for Black Death and the villain is defeated. After the battle, Gravity is congratulated by [[Spider-Man]], filling him with confidence. Finally feeling accepted, Gravity begins a relationship with his friend Lauren and continues his superhero career.<ref>''Gravity'' #1-5 (2005)</ref> Gravity later revealed his double identity to Lauren.<ref name="Beyond! #1 2006">''Beyond!'' #1 (2006)</ref>

Eventually, the group battles one another, and Henry Pym emerges as the victor when he seemingly kills the other heroes and villains. He then deceives the Beyonder into revealing his true identity as the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], and restores the rest of the group, who have been shrunk down using Pym Particles. An angered Stranger is about to destroy the group until [[Uatu the Watcher|Uatu]] appears. The presence of a Watcher unnerves the Stranger, who then allows the group to leave peacefully, and disappears. Without the Stranger's power, the planet begins to pull itself apart. Gravity uses his powers to hold the planet together and allows the rest of the group to escape. He uses the last of his power to join the group on the spaceship, but dies shortly afterwards. The remaining heroes and villains attend Gravity's funeral to pay their respects for his actions. Later, Uatu stands by Gravity's grave, waiting to witness a cosmic destiny.<ref>''Beyond!'' #1-6 (2006)</ref>

Following a cosmic residue left behind at the graveyard, the team ventures into deep space to discover that Gravity's body has been stolen and resurrected by [[Epoch (comics)|Epoch]] as the new Protector of the Universe. To protect Epoch from being consumed, Gravity empties his new cosmic-level powers into [[Galactus]] and returns to Earth to see his parents and Lauren once more.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #545-546 (2007)</ref> Later, when the Fantastic Four are fighting alongside [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Silver Surfer]] to save [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] from death, Uatu seeks out Gravity's help to act as a "scalpel" to cut out the infected portions of the universe, fulfilling his cosmic destiny.
