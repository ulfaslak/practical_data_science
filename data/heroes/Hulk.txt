The '''Hulk''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in publications by the [[American comic book|American publisher]] [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in the debut issue of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character is both the Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a vast degree of physical strength, and his alter ego '''Dr. Robert Bruce Banner''', a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, the two existing as independent personalities and resenting of the other.

Following his accidental exposure to [[gamma ray]]s during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will, often leading to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented with other personalities based on Banner's fractured psyche, from a mindless, destructive force, to a brilliant warrior, or genius scientist in his own right. Despite both Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast, including Banner's lover [[Betty Ross]], his friend [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], his cousin [[She-Hulk]], sons [[Hiro-Kala]] and [[Skaar (comics)|Skaar]], and his co-founders of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. However, his uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others.

Lee stated that the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of ''[[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''.<ref name="HulkTIG">{{Cite book| last=DeFalco | first=Tom | title=The Hulk: The Incredible Guide | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2003 | location=London, United Kingdom| page=200 | isbn=978-0-7894-9260-9}}</ref> Although the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout the character's publication history, the most usual color is green. He has two main [[catchphrase]]s: "Hulk is strongest one there is!" and the better-known "Hulk smash!", which has founded the basis for numerous [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Internet meme|meme]]s.

One of the most iconic characters in popular culture,<ref name="HulkIconic"/><ref name="HulkIconic2"/> the character has appeared on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspired real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and been referenced in a number of media. Banner and the Hulk have been adapted in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. The most notable of these were the 1970s ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' television series, in which the character was portrayed by [[Bill Bixby]] and [[Lou Ferrigno]]. The character was first played in a live-action feature film by [[Eric Bana]], with [[Edward Norton]] and [[Mark Ruffalo]] portraying [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the character]] in the films ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

===Concept and creation===
The Hulk first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 ([[cover date]]d May 1962), written by writer-editor Stan Lee, [[penciller|penciled]] and co-plotted by Jack Kirby,<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 85|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Based on their collaboration on ''The Fantastic Four'', [Stan] Lee worked with Jack Kirby.

Lee cites influence from ''[[Frankenstein]]''<ref name="OyVey"/> and ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' in the Hulk's creation:

{{quote|It was patently apparent that [the monstrous character the] [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] was the most popular character in [Marvel's recently created superhero team the] [[Fantastic Four]]. ... For a long time I'd been aware of the fact that people were more likely to favor someone who was less than perfect. ... It's a safe bet that you remember [[Quasimodo]], but how easily can you name any of the heroic, handsomer, more glamorous characters in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''? And then there's Frankenstein ... I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the Frankenstein monster. No one could ever convince me that he was the bad guy. ... He never wanted to hurt anyone; he merely groped his torturous way through a second life trying to defend himself, trying to come to terms with those who sought to destroy him. ... I decided I might as well borrow from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as well—our protagonist would constantly change from his normal identity to his superhuman alter ego and back again.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Stan Lee | last=Lee | first = Stan | title = Origins of Marvel Comics| publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]]/[[Marvel Fireside Books]]|date= 1974|location= New York, New York|page= 75|isbn= 0-671-21863-8}}</ref>}}

Kirby, commenting upon his influences in drawing the character, recalled as inspiration the tale of a mother who rescues her child who is trapped beneath a car.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,999977,00.html |last=Hill |first=Dave |title=Green with anger |date=July 17, 2003 |location=London, United Kingdom |work=[[The Guardian]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5WXHxoJ2k?url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,999977,00.html |archivedate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Lee has also compared Hulk to the [[Golem]] of Jewish mythology.<ref name="OyVey"/> In ''The Science of Superheroes'', Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War<ref name=GreshWeinberg>{{Cite book|last=Gresh|first=Lois|author2=Robert Weinberg|title=The Science of Superheroes|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|date=September 29, 2003| location= Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-46882-0}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}<!-- page=200 | page=27 Again, which is it?? --></ref> and the threat of nuclear attack, an interpretation shared by Weinstein in ''[[Up, Up and Oy Vey]]''.<ref name="OyVey"/> This interpretation corresponds with other popularized fictional media created during this time period, which took advantage of the prevailing sense among Americans that nuclear power could produce monsters and mutants.<ref name="Poole">Poole, W.

In the debut, Lee chose grey for the Hulk because he wanted a color that did not suggest any particular ethnic group.<ref name="CBG">''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' #1617 (June 2006)</ref> Colorist [[Stan Goldberg]], however, had problems with the grey coloring, resulting in different shades of grey, and even green, in the issue. After seeing the first published issue, Lee chose to change the skin color to green.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Murray|first= Will|authorlink= Will Murray|title= The Historic Hulk|journal= [[Starlog]]|issue= 312|page= 73|date= July 2003|url= https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-312JPG/312#page/n72/mode/1up}}</ref> Green was used in retellings of the origin, with even reprints of the original story being recolored for the next two decades, until ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #302 (December 1984) reintroduced the grey Hulk in flashbacks set close to the origin story. An exception is the early trade paperback, ''Origins of Marvel Comics'', from 1974, which explains the difficulties in keeping the grey color consistent in a Stan Lee written prologue, and reprints the origin story keeping the grey coloration.  Since December 1984, reprints of the first issue have displayed the original grey coloring, with the fictional canon specifying that the Hulk's skin had initially been grey.

Lee gave the Hulk's alter ego the alliterative name "Bruce Banner" because he found he had less difficulty remembering alliterative names. Despite this, in later stories he misremembered the character's name and referred to him as "'''Bob Banner'''", an error which readers quickly picked up on.<ref>{{cite news | last = Boatz | first = Darrel L. | date = December 1988 | title = Stan Lee | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 64 | page = 15 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref> The discrepancy was resolved by giving the character the official full name "'''Robert Bruce Banner'''."<ref name=CBR/>

===Series history===
The Hulk's original series was canceled with issue #6 (March 1963). Lee had written each story, with Kirby penciling the first five issues and [[Steve Ditko]] penciling and inking the sixth. The character immediately guest-starred in ''[[Fantastic Four|The Fantastic Four]]'' #12<!-- "The" part of cover logo through issue #15 --> (March 1963), and months later became a founding member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], appearing in the first two issues of the team's eponymous series (Sept. and Nov. 1963), and returning as an antagonist in issue #3 and as an ally in #5 (Jan.–May 1964). He then guest-starred in ''Fantastic Four'' #25–26 (April–May 1964), which revealed Banner's full name as Robert Bruce Banner, and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 (July 1964).<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date = 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 26|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Another important character entered Spider-Man's life in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #14.

Around this time, co-creator Kirby received a letter from a college dormitory stating the Hulk had been chosen as its official mascot.<ref name="OyVey"/> Kirby and Lee realized their character had found an audience in college-age readers.

A year and a half after ''The Incredible Hulk'' was canceled, the Hulk became one of two features in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'', beginning in issue #60 (Oct. 1964).<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 102: "''Tales to Astonish'' #60 ... introduced a new series&nbsp;– The Incredible Hulk&nbsp;– starring the famous character."</ref>

This new Hulk feature was initially scripted by Lee, with pencils by [[Steve Ditko]] and inks by [[George Roussos]]. Other artists later in this run included [[Jack Kirby]] (#68–87, June 1965&nbsp;– Oct. 1966); [[Gil Kane]] (credited as "Scott Edwards", #76, (Feb. 1966)); [[Bill Everett]] (#78–84, April–Oct. 1966); [[John Buscema]] (#85–87); and [[Marie Severin]]. The ''Tales to Astonish'' run introduced the super-villains the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]],<ref name="HulkTIG"/> who would become the Hulk's nemesis, and the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], another gamma-irradiated being.<ref name="HulkTIG"/> [[Marie Severin]] finished out the Hulk's run in ''Tales to Astonish''. Beginning with issue #102 (April 1968) the book was retitled ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2,<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 128: "Hailing 1968 as the beginning of the 'Second Age of Marvel Comics,' and with more titles to play with, editor Stan Lee discarded his split books and gave more characters their own titles ... ''Tales to Astonish'' #101 [was followed] by ''The Incredible Hulk'' #102."</ref> and ran until 1999, when Marvel canceled the series and launched ''Hulk'' #1. Marvel filed for a [[trademark]] for "The Incredible Hulk" in 1967, and the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] issued the registration in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://trademark.markify.com/trademarks/uspto/the+incredible+hulk/72277675|title= The Incredible Hulk|publisher= Markify|accessdate= January 6, 2016}}</ref>

[[Len Wein]] wrote the series from 1974 through 1978, working first with [[Herb Trimpe]], then, as of issue #194 (December 1975), with [[Sal Buscema]], who was the regular artist for ten years.<ref>{{cite book|last = Amash|first = Jim|title = Sal Buscema: Comics' Fast & Furious Artist|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= 2010|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|page = 17|isbn = 978-1605490212}}</ref> Issues #180–181 (Oct.–Nov. 1974) introduced [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] as an antagonist,<ref>[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 167: "Len Wein wrote and Herb Trimpe drew Wolverine's cameo appearance in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #180 and his premiere in issue #181."</ref> who would go on to become one of Marvel Comics' most popular characters. In 1977, Marvel launched a second title, ''[[The Rampaging Hulk]]'', a black-and-white comics magazine.<ref name="HulkTIG"/> This was originally conceived as a flashback series, set between the end of his original, short-lived solo title and the beginning of his feature in ''Tales to Astonish''.<ref>Sanderson, "1970s", in Gilbert (2008), p. 178: "This black-and-white magazine starred the Hulk in adventures set in Europe shortly after his original six-issue series."</ref> After nine issues, the magazine was retitled ''The Hulk!'' and printed in color.<ref>Sanderson, "1970s", in Gilbert (2008), p. 186: "To appeal to the audience of the popular new ''Incredible Hulk'' TV series, Marvel revamped ''The Rampaging Hulk'' magazine, calling it ''The Hulk!''."</ref>

In 1977, two Hulk [[television film]]s were aired to strong ratings, leading to an [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|''Incredible Hulk'' TV series]] which aired from 1978 to 1982. A huge ratings success, the series introduced the popular Hulk [[catchphrase]], "Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry", and broadened the character's popularity from a niche comic book readership into the mainstream consciousness.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|authorlink= Glenn Greenberg |date= February 2014|title = The Televised Hulk|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 70|pages= 19–26|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

[[Bill Mantlo]] became the series' writer for five years beginning with issue #245 (March 1980). Mantlo's "Crossroads of Eternity" stories (#300–313, Oct. 1984&nbsp;– Nov. 1985) explored the idea that Banner had suffered [[child abuse]]. Later Hulk writers [[Peter David]] and [[Greg Pak]] have called these stories an influence on their approaches to the character.<ref>{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Patrick Daniel | date = February 1992 | title = Peter David | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 105 | page = 22 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Taylor | first=Robert | title=Greg Goes Wild on Planet Pak | work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | publisher=Wizard Entertainment Group | date=August 3, 2006 | url = http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001199809.cfm | accessdate=November 15, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070402044123/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001199809.cfm |archivedate = April 2, 2007}}</ref> Mantlo left the series for ''[[Alpha Flight]]'' and that series' writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] took over ''The Incredible Hulk''.<ref>{{cite web| last=Serwin | first=Andy | title=The Wizard Retrospective: Mike Mignola | work= Wizard| publisher=Wizard Entertainment Group | date=July 23, 2007 | url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/005255245.cfm | accessdate=November 13, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080120105210/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/005255245.cfm |archivedate = January 20, 2008}}</ref> The final issue of Byrne's six issue run featured the wedding of Bruce Banner and [[Betty Ross]].<ref name="DeFalcos">DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 227: "Dr. Bruce Banner first met Betty Ross in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962) and finally married her in issue #319 by John Byrne."</ref> Writer Peter David began a twelve-year run with issue #331 (May 1987). He returned to the [[Roger Stern]] and Mantlo abuse storylines, expanding the damage caused, and depicting Banner as suffering [[dissociative identity disorder|dissociative identity disorder (DID)]].<ref name="HulkTIG"/>

In 1998, David killed off Banner's long-time love Betty Ross. Marvel executives used Ross' death as an opportunity to pursue the return of the Savage Hulk.

==Fictional character biography==
During the experimental detonation of a gamma bomb, scientist Robert Bruce Banner saves teenager [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] who has driven onto the testing field; Banner pushes Jones into a trench to save him, but is hit with the blast, absorbing massive amounts of gamma radiation. He awakens later seemingly unscathed, but that night transforms into a lumbering grey form. A pursuing soldier dubs the creature a "hulk".<ref name="Hulk1">{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|inker= [[Paul Reinman|Reinman, Paul]]|story= The Hulk|title= The Incredible Hulk|issue= 1|date= May 1962|page = 8}}</ref> Originally, it was believed that Banner's transformations into the Hulk were caused by sunset and undone at sunrise, but later, after Rick witnessed Banner turn into Hulk at daytime following a failed attempt by Ross' men to shoot the Hulk into space, it was discovered to be caused by anger. Banner was cured in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #4, but chose to restore Hulk's powers with Banner's intelligence. The gamma-ray machine needed to affect the transformation-induced side effects that made Banner temporarily sick and weak when returned to his normal state.

In ''The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #1 (September 1963), the Hulk became a founding member of the title's eponymous superhero team. By ''The Avengers'' #3, overuse of the gamma ray machine rendered the Hulk as an uncontrollable, rampaging monster, subject to spontaneous changing. In ''Tales to Astonish'' #59 (September 1964) the Hulk appeared as an antagonist for [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]]. The series established stress as the trigger for Banner turning into the Hulk and vice versa.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= [[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]]|inker= [[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]|story= The Incredible Hulk|title= [[Tales to Astonish]]|issue= 60|date= October 1964}}</ref> It was during this time that the Hulk developed a more savage and childlike personality, shifting away from his original portrayal as a brutish but not entirely unintelligent figure. Also, his memory, both long-term and short-term, would now become markedly impaired in his Hulk state. ''Tales to Astonish'' #64 (February 1965) was the last Hulk story to feature him speaking in complete sentences. In ''Tales to Astonish'' #77 (March 1966), Banner's and the Hulk's dual identity became publicly known when Rick Jones, mistakenly convinced that Banner was dead (when he actually had been catapulted into the future), told Major [[Glenn Talbot]], a rival to Banner for the affections of Betsy Ross, the truth. Consequently, Glenn informed his superiors and that turned Banner into a wanted fugitive upon returning to the present.

Overcoming the trauma, the intelligent Banner, cunning Grey Hulk, and powerful Savage Hulk personalities merge into a new single entity possessing the traits of all three.

In 2000, Banner and the three Hulks (Savage Hulk, Grey Hulk, and the "Merged Hulk", now considered a separate personality and referred to as the Professor) become able to mentally interact with one another, each personality taking over the shared body as Banner began to weaken due to his suffering from [[ALS|Lou Gehrig's disease]]. During this, the four personalities (including Banner) confronted yet another submerged personality, a sadistic "Devil" intent on attacking the world and attempting to break out of Banner's fracturing psyche, but the Devil was eventually locked away again when the Leader was able to devise a cure for the disease using genes taken from the corpse of [[Brian Banner]].<ref name="HV3:13" /> In 2005, it is revealed that the Nightmare has manipulated the Hulk for years, and it is implied that some or all of the Hulk's adventures written by Bruce Jones may have been just an illusion.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[Lee Weeks|Weeks, Lee]]|inker= [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Palmer, Tom]]|story= Tempest Fugit Conclusion|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 3|issue= 81|date= July 2005}}</ref>

In 2006, the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] decide the Hulk is too dangerous to remain on Earth and send him away by rocket ship which crashes on Planet Sakaar ushering in the "[[Planet Hulk]]" storyline that saw the Hulk find allies in the [[Warbound]], and marry alien queen [[Caiera]], a relationship that was later revealed to have born him two sons: [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] and [[Hiro-Kala]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 3 #92-104.

{{Main|Alternative versions of the Hulk}}
A number of [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s and alternate timelines in Marvel Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on the Hulk, in which the character's origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In some stories, someone other than Bruce Banner is the Hulk.

Like other long-lived characters, the Hulk's character and cultural interpretations have changed with time, adding or modifying character traits. The Hulk is typically seen as a hulking man with green skin, wearing only a pair of torn purple pants that survive his physical transformation. As the character progressed, other outfits were designed that could stretch to accommodate the transformations back and forth.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} As Bruce Banner, the character is approximately 5'9" tall  and weighs 128Ibs, but when transformed into the Hulk, the character can stand between 7–8 feet tall and weigh up to 1,400Ibs.<ref name="BioMarvel"/> Following his debut, Banner's transformations were triggered at nightfall, turning him into a grey-skinned Hulk. In ''Incredible Hulk'' #2, the Hulk started to appear with green skin,<ref name="NewsAramaPg2"/> and in ''Avengers'' #3 (1963) Banner realized that his transformations were now triggered by surges of adrenaline in response to feelings of fear, pain or anger.<ref name="NewsAramaPg3"/> ''Incredible Hulk'' #227 (1978) established that the Hulk's separate personality was not due to the mutation affecting his brain, but because Banner was suffering from [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]], with the savage Green Hulk representing Banner's repressed childhood rage and aggression,<ref name="NewsAramaPg5"/> and the Grey Hulk representing Banner's repressed selfish desires and urges.<ref name="NewsAramaPg9"/>

Banner, a [[physicist]], is sarcastic and seemingly very self-assured when he first appears in ''Incredible Hulk'' #1, but is also emotionally withdrawn in most fashions.<ref name="HulkTIG"/> Banner designed the gamma bomb which caused his affliction, and the ironic twist of his self-inflicted fate has been one of the most persistent common themes.<ref name="OyVey">{{Cite book|last= Weinstein|first= Simcha|title= Up, Up, and Oy Vey!|publisher= Leviathan Press| date= 2006|location= Baltimore, Maryland|pages= 82–97|isbn=978-1-881927-32-7}}</ref> Arie Kaplan describes the character thus: "Robert Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic, always wary that the monster inside him will erupt, and therefore he can't form meaningful bonds with anyone."<ref name=Kaplan>{{Cite book|last= Kaplan|first= Arie|title= Masters of the Comic Book Universe Revealed!|publisher= [[Chicago Review Press]]|date= 2006|page= 58|location= Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1556526336}}</ref> As a child, Banner's father [[Brian Banner|Brian]] often got mad and physically abused both Banner and his mother, creating the [[complex (psychology)|psychological complex]] of fear, anger, and the fear of anger and the destruction it can cause that underlies the character. Banner has been shown to be emotionally repressed, but capable of deep love for Betty Ross, and for solving problems posed to him. Under the writing of Paul Jenkins, Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive, applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him. On the occasions that Banner has controlled the Hulk's body, he has applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning. It was shown after his ability to turn into the Hulk was taken away by the Red Hulk that Banner has been extremely versatile as well as cunning when dealing with the many situations that followed. When he was briefly separated from the Hulk by Doom, Banner became criminally insane, driven by his desire to regain the power of the Hulk, but once the two recombined he came to accept that he was a better person with the Hulk to provide something for him to focus on controlling rather than allowing his intellect to run without restraint against the world.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Aaron, Jason|penciller= Palo, Jefte|inker= Palo, Jefte|story= Hulk: United Part 1|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 4|issue= 13|date= November 2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

;Hulk
The original Grey Hulk was shown as average in intelligence who roamed aimlessly and became annoyed at "puny" humans who took him for a dangerous monster. Shortly after becoming the Hulk, his transformation continued turning him green, coinciding with him beginning to display primitive speech,<ref name="NewsAramaPg2"/> and by ''Incredible Hulk'' #4, radiation treatments gave Banner's mind complete control of the Hulk's body. While Banner relished his indestructibility and power, he was quick to anger and more aggressive in his Hulk form and while he became known as a hero alongside the Avengers, his increasing paranoia caused him to leave the group, believing he would never be trusted.<ref name="NewsAramaPg3"/>

Originally, the Hulk was shown as simple minded and quick to anger.<ref name=Hulk4>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]]|story= The Monster and the Machine!|title= The Incredible Hulk|issue= 4|date= November 1962}}</ref>  The Hulk generally divorces his identity from Banner's, decrying Banner as "puny Banner."<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Milgrom, Al|penciller= Milgrom, Al|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= The Monster's Analyst|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 221|date= September 1972}}</ref> From his earliest stories, the Hulk has been concerned with finding sanctuary and quiet<ref name="OyVey"/> and often is shown reacting emotionally to situations quickly.

Originally, Stan Lee wanted the Hulk to be grey but due to ink problems, Hulk's color was changed to green. This was later changed in story to indicate that the {{anchor|Grey Hulk}}'''Grey Hulk''' and the Savage Hulk are separate personalities or entities fighting for control in Bruce's subconscious. The Grey Hulk incarnation can do the more unscrupulous things that Robert Bruce Banner could not bring himself to do, with many sources comparing the Grey Hulk to the moody teenager that Banner never allowed himself to be. While the Grey Hulk still had the "madder he gets, the stronger he gets" part that is similar to the Savage Hulk, it is on a much slower rate. It is said by Leader that the Grey Hulk is stronger on nights of the New Moon and weaker on nights of the Full Moon. Originally, the night is when Bruce Banner becomes the Grey Hulk and changes back by dawn. In later comics, willpower or stress would have Robert Bruce Banner turn into the Grey Hulk.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Milgrom, Al|penciller= Milgrom, Al|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= The More Things Change ...|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 324|date= October 1986}}</ref> During one storyline where he was placed under a spell to prevent him turning back into Bruce Banner and publicly presumed dead when he was teleported away from a gamma bomb explosion that destroyed an entire town, the Grey Hulk adopted a specific name as {{anchor|Joe Fixit}}'''Joe Fixit''', a security guard for a Las Vegas casino owner, with the Grey Hulk often being referred to as Joe after these events.{{issue|date=April 2018}}

The {{anchor|Gravage Hulk}}'''Gravage Hulk''' is the result of Robert Bruce Banner using the Gamma Projector on himself which merged his Savage Hulk and Grey Hulk personas. This form possesses the raw power of the Savage Hulk and the cunning intellect of the Grey Hulk. While he doesn't draw on anger to empower him, the Gravage Hulk persona draws on dimensional nexus energies to increase his level.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #60. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The {{anchor|Dark Hulk}}'''Dark Hulk''' persona is the result of Hulk being possessed by Shanzar. This form has black skin and is viciously strong.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #271. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Convinced that unaided, the Banner, Green Hulk and Grey Hulk identities would eventually destroy each other, Doc Samson uses hypnosis to merge the three to create a new single identity combining Banner's intelligence with the Grey Hulk's and Banner's attitudes, and the Green Hulk's body. This new or {{anchor|Merged Hulk}}'''Merged Hulk''' considered himself cured and began a new life, but the merger was not perfect, and the Hulk sometimes still considered Banner a separate person, and when overcome with rage, the Merged Hulk would transform back into Banner's human body while still thinking himself the Hulk.<ref name="NewsAramaPg9"/> The Merged Hulk is the largest of the three primary Hulk incarnations and has a higher base line. While in a calm emotional state, the Merged Hulk is stronger than Savage Hulk when he is calm. Unlike the Savage Hulk and the Grey Hulk, Robert Bruce Banner subconsciously installed a type of safeguard within this incarnation. The safeguard is that when the Merged Hulk gets angry, he regresses back to Robert Bruce Banner with the mind of the Savage Hulk.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= David, Peter|penciller= Keown, Dale|inker= Farmer, Mark|story= Hit and Myth|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 379|date= March 1991}}</ref>

The {{anchor|Green Scar}}'''Green Scar''' persona is unleashed on Sakaar and is considered an enraged version of Gravage Hulk. In addition, he is an expert in armed combat like the use of swords and shields. Green Scar is also a capable leader and an expert strategist.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 1 #93</ref>

{{anchor|Kluh}}'''Kluh''' is described as the Hulk's Hulk. This form has black skin, red lines, and a mohawk. Kluh had incredible power where he bested the inverted Avengers and knocked around Nova and has normal intellect.<ref name="Avengers & X-Men: AXIS"/>

{{anchor|Doc Green}}'''Doc Green''' is a variation of the Merged Hulk persona that is the result of Extremis fixing Hulk's brain. This persona is powerful enough to destroy Tony Stark's mansion with one thunderclap.<ref name="Hulk #5"/>

'''Immortal Hulk''' is the result of Bruce Banner and Hulk having been through different deaths and rebirths. This incarnation is articulate, smart, cunning, and does merciless attacks on those who do harm. Unlike the other Hulk incarnations, Immortal Hulk is content with waiting inside Bruce. If Bruce is injured by sunset, the Immortal Hulk will emerge with his transformation being limited to night-time.<ref name="Immortal Hulk"/>

===Supporting characters===
{{Main|List of Hulk supporting characters}}
Over the long publication history of the Hulk's adventures, many recurring characters have featured prominently, including his best friend and sidekick [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], love interest and wife [[Betty Ross]] and her father, the often adversarial [[Thunderbolt Ross|General "Thunderbolt" Ross]]. Both Banner and Hulk have families created in their respective personas. Banner is son to Brian, an abusive father who killed Banner's mother while she tried to protect her son from his father's delusional attacks, and cousin to [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters]], the [[She-Hulk]], who serves as his frequent ally.<ref name="DeFalco197">DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 197: "Stan Lee decided to introduce a female version of the Hulk ...

''The Fantastic Four'' #12<!-- "The" part of cover logo through issue #15 --> (March 1963), featured the Hulk's first battle with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. Although many early Hulk stories involve Ross trying to capture or destroy the Hulk, the main villain is often a radiation-based character, like the [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Yuri Topolov)|Gargoyle]] or the Leader, along with other foes such as the [[Toad Men]], or Asian warlord General Fang. Ross' daughter Betty loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk. General Ross' right-hand man, [[Glenn Talbot|Major Glenn Talbot]], also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing Hulk and trying to gain Betty's love more honorably. Rick Jones serves as the Hulk's friend and sidekick in these early tales. The Hulk's archenemies are the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] and the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. The Abomination is more monstrous and wreaks havoc for fun and pleasure. The Leader is a super-genius who has tried plan after plan to take over the world.

===Analysis===
The Hulk is often viewed as a reaction to war. As well as being a reaction to the [[Cold War]], the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the [[Vietnam War]] raised, and Ang Lee said that the [[Iraq War]] influenced his direction.<ref name=GreshWeinberg/><ref>{{Cite journal| title=Becoming the Hulk | journal=[[The New Yorker]] | date=June 30, 2003 | last=Lahr | first=John | page=72 | url = http://archives.newyorker.com/?iid=15295&startpage=page0000080}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title=The Clash of Symbols | newspaper=[[Sunday Herald]]|location=Glasgow, United Kingdom| date=December 23, 2007 | last=Phelan | first=Stephen | page=42}}</ref> In the [[Michael Nyman]] edited edition of ''[[The Guardian]]'', Stefanie Diekmann explored Marvel Comics' reaction to the [[September 11 attacks]]. Diekmann discussed The Hulk's appearance in the 9/11 tribute comic ''Heroes'', claiming that his greater prominence, alongside [[Captain America]], aided in "stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well-known and well-respected protagonist."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Diekmann |first=Stefanie |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/guesteditors/story/0,14481,1201733,00.html |title=Hero and superhero |date=April 24, 2004 |location=London, United Kingdom |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5WX1zzKKs?url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/guesteditors/story/0,14481,1201733,00.html |archivedate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In ''Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics'', [[Les Daniels]] addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science. He quotes Jack Kirby thus: "As long as we're experimenting with radioactivity, there's no telling what may happen, or how much our advancements in science may cost us." Daniels continues, "The Hulk became Marvel's most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the [[Atomic Age|atomic age]]."<ref name=DanielsMarvel>{{Cite book|last=Daniels|first=Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title= Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics |publisher= [[Abrams Books|Harry N.

In ''Comic Book Nation'', Bradford Wright alludes to Hulk's counterculture status, referring to a 1965 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine poll amongst college students which "revealed that student radicals ranked [[Spider-Man]] and the Hulk alongside the likes of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Che Guevara]] as their favorite revolutionary icons." Wright goes on to cite examples of his anti-authority symbol status. Two of these are "The Ballad of the Hulk" by [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], and the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' cover for September 30, 1971, a full color [[Herb Trimpe]] piece commissioned for the magazine.<ref name="Nation"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Goldberg |first=Jonah |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDMyYTQ4NTc5ZTU1Y2U0ZDc4ZjhmZmIwMmRhZjNjNDg= |title=Spin City |date=May 7, 2002 |work=National Review Online |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5WX9jU6iE?url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDMyYTQ4NTc5ZTU1Y2U0ZDc4ZjhmZmIwMmRhZjNjNDg= |archivedate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Hulk has been caricatured in such [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] as ''[[The Simpsons]]'',<ref name=IAmFuriousYellow>{{Cite episode |series= [[The Simpsons]]|title=[[I Am Furious Yellow]] |airdate= April 28, 2002|season=13|number= 18|credits = [[John Swartzwelder|Swartzwelder, John]] (writer); [[Chuck Sheetz|Sheetz, Chuck]] (director)|network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]}}</ref> ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and ''[[Family Guy]]'',<ref>{{Cite episode | title= [[Chitty Chitty Death Bang]]|series= [[Family Guy]]|credits= [[Danny Smith (writer)|Smith, Danny]] (writer); [[Dominic Polcino|Polcino, Dominic]] (director)|network= Fox Broadcasting Company|airdate= April 18, 1999|season= 1|number=3}}</ref> and such [[comedy]] [[television program|TV series]] as ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]|credits= [[Ben Elton|Elton, Ben]], [[Rik Mayall|Mayall, Rik]], and [[Lise Mayer|Mayer, Lise]] (writers); Posner, Geoff (director)|title= [[Summer Holiday (The Young Ones episode)|Summer Holiday]]|seriesno= 2|number= 6| airdate= June 19, 1984}}</ref> The character is also used as a cultural reference point for someone displaying anger or agitation. For example, in a 2008 ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' review of an ''[[EastEnders]]'' episode, a character is described as going "into Incredible Hulk mode, smashing up his flat."<ref>{{Cite news| title=We love telly: We love soaps | newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] | location=London, United Kingdom | date=February 5, 2008 | last=Quigley | first=Maeve | page=1}}</ref> The Hulk, especially his alter-ego Bruce Banner, is also a common reference in rap music.

The 2003 [[Ang Lee]]-directed ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' film saw discussion of the character's appeal to [[Asian American]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marchetti |first=Gina |url=http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node/68 |title=Hollywood Taiwan |journal=Film International |volume=2 |issue=6 |date=November 2004 |pages=42–51 |issn=1651-6826 |doi=10.1386/fiin.2.6.42 |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5WXGSuwQb?url=http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node%2F68 |archivedate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Taiwanese-born Ang Lee commented on the "subcurrent of repression" that underscored the character of The Hulk, and how that mirrored his own experience: "Growing up, my artistic leanings were always repressed—there was always pressure to do something 'useful,' like being a doctor." Jeff Yang, writing for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', extended this self-identification to Asian American culture, arguing that "the passive-aggressive streak runs deep among Asian Americans—especially those who have entered creative careers, often against their parents' wishes."<ref>{{cite web|last=Yang |first=Jeff |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/gate/archive/2006/06/01/apop.DTL |title=Look ...

There have been explorations about the real world possibility of Hulk's gamma-radiation based origin. In ''The Science of Superheroes'', Lois Grest and Robert Weinberg examined Hulk's powers, explaining the scientific flaws in them. Most notably, they point out that the level of [[gamma radiation]] Banner is exposed to at the initial blast would induce radiation sickness and kill him, or if not, create significant cancer risks for Banner, because hard radiation strips cells of their ability to function. They go on to offer up an alternate origin, in which a Hulk might be created by biological experimentation with [[adrenal gland]]s and [[green fluorescent protein|GFP]]. Charles Q. Choi from LiveScience.com further explains that unlike the Hulk, gamma rays are not green; existing as they do beyond the visible spectrum, gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe. He also explains that gamma rays are so powerful (the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation and 10,000 times more powerful than visible light) that they can even convert energy into matter&nbsp;– a possible explanation for the increased mass that Bruce Banner takes on during transformations. "Just as the Incredible Hulk 'is the strongest one there is,' as he says himself, so too are gamma ray bursts the most powerful explosions known."<ref>{{cite web| last=Choi | first=Charles Q. | title=Gamma Rays: The Incredible, Hulking Reality | publisher=LiveScience | date=June 11, 2008 | url=http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/080611-incredible-hulk.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140409043518/http://www.livescience.com/2590-gamma-rays-incredible-hulking-reality.html|archivedate= April 9, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate=June 12, 2008}}</ref>

==Other Marvel characters by the same name==
Prior to the debut of the Hulk in May 1962, Marvel had earlier monster characters that used the name "Hulk", but had no direct relation.

* Debuting in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #75 (June 1960), was a huge robot built by Albert Poole called the Hulk, which was actually armor that Poole would wear. In modern-day reprints, the character's name was changed to ''Grutan''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/poolealbertst.htm|title= The Hulk (Albert Poole)|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= September 11, 2010 |publisher= The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171213/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/poolealbertst.htm|archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl= no|accessdate= February 12, 2011}}</ref>
* First appearing in ''[[Journey Into Mystery]]'' #62 (Nov. 1960) was ''[[Xemnu|Xemnu the Living Hulk]]'', a huge, furry alien monster.<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 79: "The lead story of [''Journey into Mystery''] issue #62, 'I Was a Slave of the Living Hulk', introduced a giant monster called the Hulk&nbsp;– similar in name only to the future Hulk."</ref> Coincidentally, the character's debut story was also illustrated by Jack Kirby. The character reappeared in issue #66 (March 1961). Since then the character has been a mainstay in the Marvel Universe, and was renamed [[Xemnu]] the Titan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/xemnuthetitan.htm|title= Xemnu the Titan|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= March 15, 2012|publisher= The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171435/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/xemnuthetitan.htm|archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl= no|accessdate= January 23, 2013}}</ref>
* A huge, orange, slimy monster was featured in a movie called ''The Hulk'' in ''Tales to Astonish'' #21 (July 1961). In modern-day reprints, the character's name was changed to the ''Glop''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/hulkgloptta.htm|title= Hulk (Glop)|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= February 8, 2006|publisher= The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171154/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/hulkgloptta.htm|archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl= no|accessdate= February 12, 2011}}</ref>
