'''Black Bolt''' ('''Blackagar Boltagon''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appears in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #45 (December 1965). Black Bolt is the ruler of the [[Inhumans]], a reclusive race of genetically altered superhumans. Black Bolt's signature power is his voice, as his electron-harnessing ability is linked to the speech center of his brain. Speaking triggers a massive disturbance in the form of a highly destructive shockwave capable of leveling a city. Due to the extreme danger posed by this power, the character has undergone rigorous mental training to prevent himself from uttering a sound, even in his sleep, and he usually remains completely silent and speaks through sign language or via a spokesperson.

The character of Black Bolt has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as arcade and [[video game]]s, animated [[television program|television series]], and merchandise such as [[trading card]]s.

He made his live-action debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] with the television series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]'', portrayed by [[Anson Mount]].

Karnak, Gorgon, and Triton covertly join the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] while Black Bolt and Medusa must attempt the [[assassination]] of the Shi'ar ruler [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]] at a ceremony ratifying an alliance between the Shi'ar and the [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#S|Spartoi]].

In the title ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'',<ref>''New Avengers'' #7 (July 2005)</ref> Black Bolt is revealed to be a member of a superhero council called the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]. Via a [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] of Marvel continuity, the group form during the [[Kree-Skrull War]]<ref>''The Avengers'' #88–97 (June 1971 – March 1972)</ref> to deal with threats to Earth. During the "[[Son of M]]" storyline, the mutant [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] steals a canister of Terrigen crystals from Attilan, with Black Bolt and the rest of the Royal Family attempting to retrieve it.<ref>''Son of M'' #1–6 (February – July 2006)</ref>

Black Bolt also rejects the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and refuses to become involved in the ensuing [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. Courtesy of the hero [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]], Black Bolt monitors the situation.<ref>''Civil War'' #1–7 (July 2006 – January 2007)</ref> In the limited series ''[[Silent War]]'', the [[United States armed forces|US military]] attacks the Inhumans to prevent them from retrieving the crystals. Believing the stolen crystals should be returned to Attilan, Black Bolt issues a warning to the [[United States]] concerning further acts of aggression, and eventually launches an offensive against the nation. Gorgon and other Inhumans are captured during the attack, which prompts Black Bolt to personally head a team to rescue his subjects and retrieve the crystals. While the mission is successful, Maximus takes advantage of the situation and overthrows and temporarily incarcerates Black Bolt.<ref>''Silent War'' #1–6 (January – August 2007)</ref>

The Illuminati also collect the [[Infinity Gems]], and—to prevent the [[abuse of power]] by the [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]] [[Thanos]] and others—split the gems between themselves, vowing that they never be used in unison again. Black Bolt is given the "Reality" gem.<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #1–5 (February 2007 – January 2008)</ref>

The character apparently suffers a setback when brutally beaten by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], on a rampage during the "[[World War Hulk]]" storyline and seeking revenge on Black Bolt for his role in the Hulk's exile from Earth.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #1–5 (August 2007 – January 2008)</ref> During the events of the [[Secret Invasion]] limited series it is revealed that this was not in fact Black Bolt, but rather a [[Skrull]], who is killed in battle by members of the Illuminati.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3 (December 2008)</ref><ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #5 (June 2007)</ref> The true Black Bolt is captured by the Skrulls, who intended to use his voice as a weapon of mass destruction.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #1 (October 2008)</ref> The character is rescued when the heroes of Earth defeat the Skrull army and discover the location of their captured teammates.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #1–6 (June 2008 – January 2009)</ref>

Black Bolt, angered by the repercussions caused by the Skrull invasion, changes tactics and embarks on an aggressive campaign against all former persecutors of the Inhumans in the [[War of Kings]] limited series. At his command, the Inhumans attack the Kree and overthrow Ronan the Accuser, with Black Bolt declaring himself supreme ruler of the Kree Empire. This is followed by a preemptive strike against the [[Shi'ar]] empire, now controlled by the usurper [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. Black Bolt intended to release the Terrigen Mist across the galaxy and end the war when, courtesy of the subsequent mutations, all are rendered equal, but the plan was interrupted by Vulcan, the two clashing as the bomb charged up. Although Vulcan was nearly killed by Black Bolt's voice, Black Bolt prepared to abandon his plan when Crystal pointed out that the powers produced by the explosion would only inspire more harm rather than good. However, an enraged Vulcan retained enough strength to stop Black Bolt from teleporting away with Crystal and Lockjaw, which resulted in Black Bolt and Vulcan apparently dying in the subsequent explosion of the Terrigen bomb, as Crystal only negated the Terrigen Mists within the bomb without shutting down its ability to explode.<ref>''X-Men: Emperor Vulcan'' #1–5 (November 2007 – March 2008); ''X-Men: Kingbreaker'' #1–4 (February – May 2009); ''War of Kings'' #1–6 (May – October 2009)</ref>

===2010s===
He in fact survived the explosion. It was revealed that Black Bolt likely represents the anomaly of the Kree Inhuman genetics program that had been predicted hundreds of thousands of years ago. The genetic prophecy was that this anomaly would bring about the end of the Supreme Intelligence. To prevent this outcome, the Kree Supreme Intelligence had ordered the destruction of all the worlds where the genetic experiments took place. Only five colonies escaped, including Earth's: these were the [[Inhumans#Universal Inhumans|Universal Inhumans]]. After his return to Attilan, Black Bolt joined the Universal Inhumans and was presented with four new brides, one from each of the other colonies.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #6–7</ref>

They returned to Earth to help defeat the last four Reeds of the Interdimensional Council.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #8–10</ref> They then faced the Kree Armada, who had been ordered by the resurrected Kree Supreme Intelligence to wipe out Earth and the Inhumans.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #11</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #600–603</ref> After the Kree fled in defeat, the Inhumans followed in pursuit.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #603</ref> Guided by Franklin Richards, Black Bolt confronted the Supreme Intelligence, surviving long enough to surrender and trigger protocols forcing terms of a truce. He convinced them that the prophecy has been broken, and that he was no longer a threat. They parted ways, but Black Bolt had to agree to Ronan (Crystal's husband) returning alone to the Kree domain.<ref>''FF'' #20-21</ref>

During the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Black Bolt was visited by [[Thanos]]' Black Order in order to demand a tribute, the heads of Inhuman younglings between the ages of 16 and 22 or the annihilation of Earth's inhabitants. Using the Terrigen Codex, Black Bolt discovered Thanos used the tribute demand as a cover for his true mission: to kill his secret Inhuman-descendant son whose identity and location were unknown even by his father.<ref>''Infinity'' #2</ref> After the Inhumans denied the tribute to [[Corvus Glaive]], Thanos personally visited Black Bolt in Attilan. Finding the Inhuman city empty with only Black Bolt left, Black Bolt unleashed a powerful scream which tore down Attilan itself and activated a Terrigen Bomb which spread the Mists across the Earth.<ref>''Infinity'' #3</ref> Thanos survived the attack and found Black Bolt still alive in the rubble. Thanos demanded to know the location of his son. Black Bolt refused and continued attacking Thanos with his voice until an enraged Thanos knocked him out.<ref>''Infinity'' #4</ref> Black Bolt was held captive for Thanos to use his power to activate the Illuminati's [[anti-matter]] bombs to destroy the Earth.<ref>''Infinity'' #5</ref> When the Illuminati arrived in the Necropolis, they found Thanos' general Supergiant, with Black Bolt under her control as she uses Black Bolt to defeat them. When Supergiant activated the bombs, Maximus appeared with the trigger. He triggered the bombs, but also used Lockjaw to transport the anti-matter bomb along with Supergiant to a distant uninhabited planet where she died in the explosion. Black Bolt was liberated and left the scene along with Maximus and Lockjaw. In the ancient location of Attilan in the Himalayas, Black Bolt hid the Terrigen Codex and made Maximus understand his survival and that of his brother were to be kept a secret. Maximus also deduced that Black Bolt was always going to activate the Terrigen Bomb irrespective of Thanos' arrival which was to herald a new age of the Inhumans.<ref>''Infinity'' #6</ref> After being examined by Maximus, Black Bolt discovered with his brother that the Terrigen Bomb had greatly diminished Black Bolt's powers. Black Bolt and Maximus agreed to keep this a secret.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #12</ref>

Using exogenetically charged waters, Maximus was able to help Black Bolt recover from the power loss he suffered after the detonation of the Terrigen Bomb.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #18</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Black Bolt takes part in the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. He is taken out by the Children of Tomorrow.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1</ref>

In the aftermath of the Secret Wars storyline, Medusa sends Nur and Auran to find Black Bolt who is forced by Maximus to use his voice against them, killing Auran.<ref>''Inhuman'' #7–8</ref> Black Bolt and Medusa end up separating over his prolonged absence from Attilan.<ref>''Inhuman'' #12</ref> Nonetheless, they team up to battle Kang the Conqueror for their son Ahura (Black Bolt had earlier given Ahura over to Kang for safe-keeping during the incursions). Unwelcome in Attilan, Black Bolt now runs the "Quiet Room," a night club that functions as a neutral zone for metahumans.<ref>''Uncanny Inhumans'' #0–1</ref> At one point, a resurrected Auran steals his voice, but it is restored with the help of Sterilon.<ref>''Uncanny Inhumans'' #16–17</ref>

During the ''[[Death of X]]'' storyline, Black Bolt is framed for the death of Cyclops.<ref>''Death of X'' #4</ref>

When the truce between the Inhumans and X-Men is broken during the ''[[Inhumans vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Black Bolt is subsequently ambushed by Emma Frost and Dazzler in the Quiet Room. A disguised Dazzler is able to absorb the energy from his voice and counterattack him with it.<ref>''IVX'' #1</ref> He is held captive by the X-Men in Forge's workshop in the dimension of Limbo until his rescue by Medusa and the Inhumans.<ref>''IVX'' #5</ref> He helps Medusa neutralize Emma Frost. In the aftermath, there is hope of reconciliation between the Royal couple as she joins Black Bolt in the Quiet Room.<ref>''IVX'' #6</ref>

Black Bolt and a group of Inhumans later tracked down Maximus and captured him for his trial. Black Bolt later spoke to Maximus privately.<ref>''Inhumans Prime'' #1</ref>

Marvel Boy later reveals that there is still hope to restore the Inhuman race on the remains of the Kree Homeworld, so the Royal family and a couple of new Inhumans journey to space to find the secret buried on Hala.<ref>''Royals'' #1</ref>

However, they were soon confronted by two surprises: Medusa's affliction with a mysterious illness, and the revelation of Black Bolt as Maximus in disguise. Maximus had used his psychic powers and an image inducer to switch places with his brother before leaving Earth.<ref>''Royals'' #3</ref> It was Black Bolt that was imprisoned in a deep space torture prison that was meant for Maximus. Upon defeating his fellow inmate [[Absorbing Man]], Black Bolt confronted the as-yet-unidentified jailer. When his quasi-sonic no longer works, Black Bolt was killed and revived.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #1</ref> Black Bolt later made acquaintances with Absorbing Man, Blinky, [[Metal Master (comics)|Metal Master]], and Raava.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #2</ref> After discovering that the Jailer is an Inhuman who was incarcerated in the torture prison and has since taken over it, Black Bolt and his fellow inmates fight the Jailer. Absorbing Man sacrifices himself so that Black Bolt can kill the Jailer and enable his fellow inmates to escape.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #6</ref>

Black Bolt returns to Earth with Blinky. They inform [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] about her husband Crusher's heroic death.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #8</ref> At the funeral, Blinky is kidnapped by Lash.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #9</ref> He forces Black Bolt to surrender and injects him with a poison to prepare his blood to be used as part of a new Terrigen-type bomb that will produce new Inhumans. The pain of the process sends Black Bolt's mind towards Medusa's mind. They interact on a psychic plane, and update each other. He finds out about Medusa's love for Gorgon, and they determine that they cannot go back to their marriage. Instead, they will move forward, and Medusa promises to find them as they get separated. Black Bolt breaks free, only to succumb to the poison. Blinky tries to protect him, but turns into a monster channeling the Jailer.<ref>''Black Bolt'' #10</ref>

After an encounter with the Progenitors, Medusa and Black Bolt meet on the Astral Plane and agreed to continue as partners and not lovers.

In the pages of "[[Death of the Inhumans]]," Black Bolt to call together the four Queens of the Universal Inhuman tribes to respond to this threat. However, the meeting goes far from as planned, as an Inhuman executioner named Vox, a Super-Inhuman created by the Kree, begins his bloody rampage across the place. When Black Bolt and his Royal Family reached the meeting place, they discover the bodies of Oola Udonta, Aladi Ko Eke, Onomi Whitemane and Goddess Ovoe, with the same three words written in their blood on a banner hanging about their corpses and eventually realized that they fell in to a trap as one of the dead Inhumans was wired with an explosive. While most of Black Bolt's group made it out alive, thanks to Lockjaw, Triton was not so lucky and was killed in the explosion. Black Bolt then sent Lockjaw to New Arctilan to retrieve his brother Maximus.<ref>''Death of the Inhumans'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Vox subdues Karnak, Black Bolt arrives where he walks through the halls of the Kree base speaking every name of the fallen Inhumans, making it a song about death. Eventually, it comes down to just Black Bolt and Vox who's holding Karnak as a shield. Black Bolt signs to Karnak to have Vox take him instead. Vox apparently accepts the change as he teleports himself behind Black Bolt. Before Karnak’s very eyes, Vox slits Black Bolt’s throat.<ref>''Death of the Inhumans'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Kree take Black Bolt prisoner and repair the damage done to his throat without using any sedatives or anesthesia to dull the pain which prompted them to think that Black Bolt's great power is gone when he doesn't scream and therefore the prophecy about the Midnight King is no longer a threat to the Kree. However while being transported, it turns out he still has his voice, but its faint. After killing several Kree, Black Bolt secures a firearm and finds Ronan the Accuser alive. However, he is a prisoner of Vox and has been experimented on. At Ronan’s request, Black Bolt enables him a mercy killing.<ref>''Death of the Inhumans'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Black Bolt's Terrigen-mutated physique surpasses the superhuman physique of typical Inhumans: his strength, stamina, durability and reflexes are all well above typical Inhuman or human levels. His speed and agility are also highly enhanced. He also possesses superhuman senses.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Bolt(2017-2018) #1|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> An organic mechanism in his brain's speech center produces an unknown particle that interacts with ambient electrons, enabling him to produce certain mentally-controlled phenomena. The most devastating of the effects is Black Bolt's "quasi-sonic scream". Because his electron-harnessing ability is linked to the speech center of his brain, any attempt to use his vocal cords triggers an uncontrollable disturbance of the particle/electron interaction field. Because of this limitation, Black Bolt must be constantly vigilant of even the softest of utterances lest he destroy anything or anyone in his path. At full strength, his voice has the capability to destroy planets,<ref>''Inhumans'' vol. 2 #6 (April 1999)</ref><ref>''Inhumans'' vol. 3 #4 (October 2000)</ref> while a whisper can rock a battleship. When Black Bolt was captured and experimented on by the Skrulls, it was shown that his "Sonic Scream" is triggered by, and at least partially dependent on, his emotional state.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3</ref>

The fork-like antenna worn upon his forehead helps Black Bolt control his power. He can channel his powers inward to increase his strength and speed, and can focus it through the focusing tool or his arms as concussive blasts. Black Bolt is capable of channeling all available energy into one devastating punch called his Master Blow, which renders him extremely vulnerable subsequently. By concentrating his electrons into anti-electrons, he can fly at speeds up to {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}} for a period of six hours, protected by an [[anti-graviton]] field. Black Bolt can create a nearly impenetrable force field by focusing his energy around himself, and can use his electron abilities as extrasensory probes, highly sensitive to electromagnetic phenomena, and he can also jam certain electromagnetic mechanisms. Though exhausting, he can create particle/electron interaction fields solid enough to be traversed upon.

Black Bolt also is at least partially resistant against telepathy and shares a semi-telepathic bond with those of his blood (such as the Inhuman royal family and certain others), as was evident when he was able to resist the mental abilities of his telepathically powerful brother, Maximus, and on different occasions, use his own abilities to overpower and take control of Maximus' mind. One of Black Bolt's main uses for his telepathic ability is to communicate his wishes to his wife, Medusa the Queen, who then acts as his mouthpiece to the rest of his subjects. He can also use this limited telepathy to communicate his destination wishes to the royal family's teleporting dog, Lockjaw.

* Black Bolt appears in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'', season 1, episode "Inhuman Nature", voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]. He is the King of the Inhumans and cannot speak without using his sonic scream, despite having his antenna in this show. Because of this, Medusa speaks for him and his only line being "Smash" is what destroys the barrier put up by Maximus. In the season 2, episode "Planet Monster" Pt. 2, Black Bolt (alongside Gorgon and Lockjaw) are among the superheroes that help the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and the Avengers fight the forces of the Supreme Intelligence. When Black Bolt quotes "Stop", it disables the Kree warship's shields.

* Black Bolt appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', in season 3, episode "Inhumanity", voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].<ref>{{cite episode|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4600934/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_11|series= Ultimate Spider-Man |title= Inhumanity| season= 3 | number= 18| date= August 4, 2015}}</ref> Maximus had taken control of the Inhuman Royal Family and declared war upon humans by using Attilan. Spider-Man and Black Bolt's younger cousin Triton are able to free the Inhuman Royal Family from Maximus' control, as Maximus had sent the city into a collision course with Manhattan. After webbing up his own ears for protection, Spider-Man webs Black Bolt to a radio tower, allowing Black Bolt to be firmly anchored to permit him to powerfully speak the word "Peace", sending Attilan gently skywards away from Manhattan Island, ending Maximus' threat against Manhattan. In season 4, episode "Agent Web," Black Bolt and the rest of the Inhuman Royal Family appear to confront Spider-Man and Triton outside of the abandoned Inhuman city of Ataron. When Spider-Man begs forgiveness for trespassing while explaining why they did it, Medusa interpreted for Black Bolt stating that they have just arrived to give Spider-Man and Triton a ride back to the Triskelion while thanking them for protecting Atarog.

* Black Bolt appears in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' episode "Crystal Blue Persuasion", voiced by [[Trevor Devall]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Crystal Blue Persuasion|series=Guardians of the Galaxy|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=12|airdate=February 28, 2016}}</ref> He was among the Inhumans that were in stasis due to a Terrigen Plague that caused crystals to form on their bodies. Maximus the Mad used mind-control technology to control Black Bolt into attacking the Guardians of the Galaxy, Medusa, and Lockjaw. When Ronan the Accuser confiscated the mind-control helmet to control Black Bolt into having Lockjaw teleport Black Bolt and Star-Lord into the Terrigen Crystal caverns beneath Attilan, Star-Lord had to evade Black Bolt's attacks until he used the CryptoCube to eliminate the plague on the infected. Once that was done, Black Bolt flew toward Ronan the Accuser's ship and quotes "Never" (rejecting Ronan's control and orders) which wrecks Ronan the Accuser's ship. Through Medusa, Black Bolt thanked the Guardians of the Galaxy for their assistance. In the episode "Inhuman Touch", Black Bolt and the Inhuman Royal Family assist the Guardians of the Galaxy when Maximus tricks his way out of imprisonment.

During the fight between the Avengers and the Inhumans, Black Bolt and Thor engaged each other in battle where Thor tries to reason with him due to both of them being royalty. Black Bolt even quoted "Enough" which did knock Thor down. When Inferno emerges from his Terrigen cocoon, Thor tells Black Bolt that the Avengers and the Inhumans need to work together to stop Inferno. Black Bolt agrees. After Hulk and Lockjaw obtained a Terrigen Crystal which is needed for a device to clear the Terrigen Fog, Black Bolt helped to disperse it into the sky by quoting "Go" to break the antidote compound. In the episode "The Inhuman Condition," the Inhumans come to the aid of Black Bolt, Lockjaw, and Seeker when Ultron invades Attilan and captures the Inhumans. During the fight against Ultron, Black Bolt quoted "No More" where his voice attack had no effect on Ultron who then hooked Black Bolt up to a larger version of the machine that's similar to Seeker's Terrigen Mist Dispenser. The effects of the machine caused Black Bolt to moan enough to shake Attilan. Black Bolt was later freed from the machine prior to Attilan safely landing in the waters near Manhattan. In the episode "Mists of Attilan," Black Panther and [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]] visit Attilan in order to obtain the key fragment that T'Challa's grandfather entrusted to the Inhumans before the Shadow Council does.
