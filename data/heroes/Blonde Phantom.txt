'''The Blonde Phantom''' ('''Louise Grant Mason''') is a fictional masked crime fighter appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created for Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]], she [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[All Select Comics]]'' #11 ([[cover-date]]d Fall 1946), during the 1940s period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].

==Publication history==
As [[superhero]]es began to fade out of fashion in the post-war era, [[comic book]] publishers scrambled to explore new types of stories, characters, and audiences. In an attempt to appeal to young female readers, comics companies began introducing some of the first significant [[Superhero#Female superheroes|superheroines]] since [[Wonder Woman]]. Those of [[Marvel Comics]]' 1940s predecessor, [[Timely Comics]], included [[Golden Girl (Timely Comics)|Golden Girl]], [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]], [[Namora]], [[Sun Girl (Marvel Comics)|Sun Girl]], and [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]], and its teen-[[humour|humor]] star [[Millie the Model]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nolan|first= Michelle|url=http://www.cgccomics.com/news/enews/cgc_enews_0408aug.htm#a4 |title=The Super Women of Timely|work= CGC|publisher= newsletter| volume= 3| number=8 |date=August 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716131244/http://www.cgccomics.com/news/enews/cgc_enews_0408aug.htm#a4 |archivedate=July 16, 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> Other companies' included [[Fox Feature Syndicate|Fox Comics]]' revival of [[Quality Comics]]' [[Phantom Lady]]; and DC's [[Black Canary]].

The creator of the Blonde Phantom is disputed. [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] says the character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Syd Shores]],<ref name="DonMark"/> but Al Sulman claimed to have created the character during his time as script editor for Timely Comics: "Wonder Woman was popular, so Stan [Lee] thought we should have a heroine, too. So I created a character called 'The Blonde Phantom', and I wrote those strips myself."<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Amash|first1= Jim|last2= Morris|first2= Brian K.|date= August 2011|title= I Had a Liking for the Comic Magazine Business|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 50|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The Blonde Phantom debuted in ''[[All Select Comics]]'' #11 (Fall 1946),<ref name="DonMark">[http://www.toonopedia.com/blondeph.htm The Blonde Phantom] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

The series lasted a little over two years (from #12–22, Winter 1946 to March 1949), during which time the crime fighter also appeared as a backup feature in:

*''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #84–91 (Oct. 1947 – April 1949)
* ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' #1 (Aug. 1948)
* ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner Comics]]'' #25–28 & 30 (Spring – Oct. 1948 & Feb. 1949)
* all three issues of ''[[Blackstone, the Magic Detective|Blackstone the Magician]]'' (#2–4, May–Sept. 1948)
* ''[[Namora]]'' #2 (Oct. 1948)
* ''[[Sun Girl (Marvel Comics)|Sun Girl]]'' #2–3 (Oct.-Dec. 1948).<ref name=gcd />

The character was the province of no one artist, and aside from originator Shores, her adventures in this wide variety of comics were [[penciller|pencilled]] by [[Vince Alascia]], [[Ken Bald]], Allen Bellman, [[Carl Burgos]], Vernon Henkel, [[Mike Sekowsky]], [[Ed Winiarski]], the pseudonymous [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas]], and others. When not [[inker|inking]] themselves, the pencilers were embellished by inkers including [[Al Avison]], [[Jack Binder (comics)|Jack Binder]], and [[Harry Sahle]].<ref name=gcd />

''Blonde Phantom Comics'' changed titles and formats completely to become the [[anthology|anthological]] [[romance comic]] ''Lovers'' with issue #23 (May 1949).<ref name=gcd />

===Concurrent Blonde Phantom===
Comics historian [[Jess Nevins]] notes that the Timely Comics teen-humor character [[Millie the Model|Millie Collins]] wore a mask and veil and posed as the "Blonde Phantom" for a cosmetics company's publicity campaign in a story in ''Millie the Model'' #2 (Oct. 1946), published near the same time as the superheroine Blonde Phantom's debut in ''All-Select Comics'' #11 (Fall 1946). Acknowledging the shared [[Marvel Universe]], Nevins writes that the famous model's stunt "perhaps inspired Louise Grant to put on a costume and fight crime".<ref>[http://www.reocities.com/jjnevins/phantom.html The Blonde Phantom (I)"] at [[Jess Nevins|Nevins, Jess]], [http://www.reocities.com/Athens/Olympus/7160/gaguide.html A Guide to Golden Age Marvel Characters].

===Revival===
The character's civilian identity, Louise Mason, was reintroduced in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #2 (June 1989). Two issues later, she was revealed to be the retired former superhero. Mason remained a series cast-member through the final issue, #60 (Feb. 1994).<ref name=gcd-ssh>[http://www.comics.org/series/3858/ ''The Sensational She-Hulk''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> She was featured in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] adventures in ''[[All Select Comics]] 70th Anniversary Special'' (Feb. 2009)<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/38845/ ''All Select Comics 70th Anniversary Special''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> and the five-issue [[miniseries]] ''[[Avengers 1959]]'', beginning with issue #1 (Dec. 2011).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/61425/ ''Avengers 1959''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

In 2011, ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' ranked the Blonde Phantom 98th on its list of the "100 Sexiest Women in Comics."<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 60| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin and Golden Age adventures===
[[File:AllWinners1-1948.jpg|thumb|left|''All Winners Comics'' vol. 2, #1 (Aug. 1948), cover artist(s) unknown]]
Louise Grant, born in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], was secretary to [[private investigator|private detective]] Mark Mason. Enamored with her boss and wanting to help him break cases, she surreptitiously donned a black [[domino mask]] and a sexy, skintight, slit-leg red [[evening gown]] and [[high-heeled footwear|high heels]], and ventured out at night fighting crime. Highly athletic and seemingly trained in martial arts, the Blonde Phantom also carried a .45-caliber pistol. In a distaff echo of [[Superman]] and [[Lois Lane]], Mason had a crush on the Blonde Phantom, but not on Louise. At an unspecified point, the Blonde Phantom fought alongside the [[All-Winners Squad]]<!--hyphen OK--> superhero team for an adventure.<ref>[http://www.marveldirectory.com/groupsandteams/allwinners.htm All-Winners Squad] at MarvelDirectory.com, reprinted from ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Teams 2005''</ref>

===Modern Age===
Louise Grant had left crimefighting to marry her employer, Mark Mason, in 1949 and takes his last name. She gave birth to their daughter Wanda and, later, to son Earl. After her husband's death, she began working as a legal secretary for [[district attorney]] Blake Tower in the 1989–1994 series ''The Sensational She-Hulk'', acting as the general voice-of-reason for both Tower and Jennifer Walters / [[She-Hulk]].

Mason would often find herself more or less willingly pulled into the She-Hulk's surreal adventures, and occasionally vice versa. They would confront many menaces, from [[Stilt-Man]] in issue #4 (Aug. 1989) to a town where stepping out of line, even swearing, was fatally punished. Mason would even accompany She-Hulk into outer space, where the pair become allies of the space-faring hero [[Razorback (comics)|Razorback]] and his compatriots U.S. Archer and Al the alien. After being taken prisoner by the subterranean ruler the [[Mole Man]], she was restored to a more youthful version of herself by a mysterious chemical process in issue #33 (Nov. 1991).

Mason, affectionately nicknamed "Weezi", began a romantic relationship with Jennifer's father, Morris Walters in #36 (Feb. 1992). Mason later found herself trading physical stature and powers with a none-too-pleased She-Hulk in issue #48–49 (Feb.-March 1993), becoming so enamored with her new form and abilities that she only changed back when Morris revealed he wanted Weezi the way she had been.

==Powers and abilities==
The Blonde Phantom had no superhuman powers.  She was an athletic woman, a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and a fine markswoman with the conventional handgun she carried.  She also had excellent secretarial skills, as the secretary for the Mark Mason Detective Agency, and later as the secretary of New York City District Attorney Blake Tower.

==Phantom Blonde==
Louise's daughter, Wanda Louise Mason, introduced in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #21 (Nov. 1990), briefly followed her mother's crime-fighter legacy, becoming the costumed Phantom Blonde two issues later,<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/phantomblonde.htm Phantom Blonde] at The Appendix to The Handbook of Marvel Universe</ref> in a story by writer [[Steve Gerber]] and penciler Buzz Dixon. She was later considered a "potential recruit" for the US government's superhero-training program, the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]].<ref>''Civil War: Battle Damage Report'' (March 2007)</ref>

==Other versions==
The Louise Mason version of Blonde Phantom appears as a recurring character in ''[[Marvel Adventures Spider-Man]]'' and its follow-up series, ''Spider-Man Marvel Adventures'', both published as part of the young-readers [[Marvel Adventures]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], taking place in a non-canonical [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] from mainstream Marvel continuity. Here, she is portrayed as a famed private detective who often works as a confidant to [[Spider-Man]] and his girlfriend [[Sophia "Chat" Sanduval]].<ref>''Marvel Adventures Spider-Man'' #58</ref>
