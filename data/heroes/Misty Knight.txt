==Publication history==
Misty Knight was first mentioned in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #20 (January 1975) and was created by writer [[Tony Isabella]] with artist [[Arvell Jones]].  A later [[retcon]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (1st series)  #64 by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] would reveal she had previously appeared as an unnamed character in ''Marvel Team-Up'' (1st series) #1 (March 1972), written by [[Roy Thomas]] and penciled by [[Ross Andru]]. Comics in which Knight and [[Colleen Wing]] have starred include a storyline first printed in ''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #32–33 (January — February 1977) and ''Bizarre Adventures'' #25 (March 1981) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and penciller [[Marshall Rogers]]. The original depictions of Knight, a bionically enhanced [[African American|black]] female [[detective]] with [[martial arts]] skills, were strongly influenced by the [[blaxploitation]] and [[Kung Fu]] [[fad|craze]]s of the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Misty Knight and Iron Fist had the first interracial kiss between super heroes in mainstream comics in 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2017/03/iron-fist-marvel-comics-facts/misty-knight|title= Everything You Need to Know About 'Iron Fist'|author= Khal|date= March 14, 2017|publisher= Complex|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Misty Knight is a highly skilled combatant who, in addition to her police-combat training, is proficient in [[martial arts]] and possesses near-perfect aim with firearms. She is a superb detective, having graduated at the top of her class at the police academy and earned a degree in criminology from the [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]].<ref>''Iron Fist'', vol. 1 #7</ref> Her bionic arm is superhumanly strong, and she can punch a target with incredible force, or crush objects as tough as steel in her vise-like grip. Since the rest of her body is not cybernetically enhanced, she cannot lift objects heavier than her back, shoulders, and legs can physically support. Her arm's advantages as a weapon are limited to kinetic crushing and impact forces.

Her original bionic right arm was constructed from steel, and designed by Stark International. Her new arm was built by [[Stark Industries]] and is an alloy of [[vibranium|Antarctic vibranium]] and [[diamond]]; at close range it can liquefy all known metals, including [[adamantium]]. It is now able to generate a wide anti-gravity repulsor field similar to [[Iron Man's armor]].<ref>''Daughters of the Dragon'' #6</ref>  It can apparently release a concentrated beam of cryogenic energy, which can cover a target in a blanket of ice from a distance. This cold seems to make the target much more fragile, allowing otherwise durable materials to be broken or rended when frozen.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #7 (2007)</ref> Iron Man revealed the arm also displays technopathic capabilities, teaching Misty how to control a horde of robots.<ref name="World War Hulk: Aftersmash #1"/> Following her "pregnancy", Danny Rand spent money on additional features to the arm, including magnetism and a concussive blast.<ref>''Shadowland: Blood on the Street'' #1–3</ref>

===MC2===
In the alternate future of the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, Misty eventually settled down and married Iron Fist. Unfortunately, at some point in the past, she died of cancer.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Misty eventually became Luke's lover, after some time has passed since the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]'s murder of Tigra.
