'''Mayhem''' ('''Brigid O'Reilly''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

[[Emma Lahana]] portrays the character's live appearance in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television series ''[[Cloak & Dagger (TV series)|Cloak & Dagger]]''. 

==Publication history==
The character of detective Brigid O'Reilly first appeared in ''[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]'' #1 (Oct 1983), and was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Rick Leonardi]]. She subsequently appeared in issues #2-4 (November 1983-January 1984) of the same series, and issues #1-5 (July 1985-March 1986) of the second ''Cloak and Dagger'' series.

In ''[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]'' Vol. 2 #5 (Mar 1986), Brigid underwent a drastic transformation and became known as Mayhem. The character subsequently appeared, as Mayhem, in ''Cloak and Dagger'' #6-9 (May–November 1986), ''Strange Tales'' #13-15 (April–June 1988), #19 (October 1988), ''The Mutant Misadventures of Cloak and Dagger'' #1-2 (October, December 1988), #5-6 (June, August 1989), #8 (November 1989), #10-18 (February 1990-June 1991), ''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #9 (1993) and #10 (1994).

Mayhem received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #8. However, some of the color plates were reversed in that issue; those pages, including Mayhem, were re-printed correctly in issue #9.

==Fictional character biography==
Brigid O'Reilly was originally a police detective in Manhattan when she learned that [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] were attacking criminals in her precinct. At first she wanted to bring the pair to justice,<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' #1</ref> but eventually she learned to trust the young crime-fighters.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' #4</ref>

Later, she took a squad of police officers to investigate a warehouse belonging to the same pharmaceutical company that was responsible for giving Cloak and Dagger their powers. Some corrupt policemen, led by Roger Falcone, exposed the other police officers to a gas to asphyxiate them.  With her dying breath, Brigid swore vengeance on Falcone. As Brigid lay dying, Cloak and Dagger found her, and though they were too late to save the other police, Cloak surrounded her and Dagger with his darkness, while Dagger tried to revive her with her light. When this appeared not to work, the pair abandoned her body to search for those responsible.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' Vol. 2 #1-4</ref>

Though Brigid O'Reilly died, she was reborn as Mayhem. In this new form, Mayhem helped Cloak and Dagger find and fight the corrupt police. She then killed Falcone as promised.<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' Vol. 2 #5</ref> She then became a vigilante, showing no mercy to the drug dealers and other criminals she pursues.

Brigid was considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.<ref name="civilwarbattledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mayhem exudes a green, venomous gas from her pores. If this gas enters another person's bloodstream, it paralyzes the person for a varying amount of time. Hence, Mayhem attacks people by raking their skin with her talon-like fingernails so that the gas will enter their bloodstreams.

The gas can also act like a [[truth serum]], forcing a victim of Mayhem to tell her the truth.

Dagger's "light-knives" dissipate upon contact with this gas.

Mayhem can levitate herself and fly.

==Other version==
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Brigid O'Reilly is a NYPD officer who is hunting down teenage criminals [[Styx and Stone]] in an effort to trace the [[Serpent Society|Serpent Skulls]] gang. Her partner [[Terror Inc.|Terry Schreck]] is critically injured and soon dies in the hospital.<ref>''All-New Ultimates'' #1-2</ref> She later speaks to her informant [[Bart Rozum]] before learning that Terry's body had disappeared from the morgue.<ref>''All-New Ultimates'' #3</ref>

In the second season, it is revealed that the green-fingernailed O'Reilly (Mayhem) is a physical copy of Brigid; Mayhem has all of Brigid's knowledge and memories but is a ruthless vigilante without compunction about murder. In the opening episodes, Mayhem proceeds to kill a number of New Orleans underworld figures, and later assumes Brigid's identity to take a criminal investigation into her own hands. In the meantime, Tyrone finds Brigid tied up at home, then teleports with Brigid to Tandy, who is at a crime scene with Mayhem<ref>{{cite episode|title=White Lines|series=Marvel's Cloak & Dagger|credits=Woolnough, Jeff (director); Peter Calloway & Niceole R.

Mayhem then starts looking for Connors, in the process killing his partner. Mina Hess' examination of Brigid proves her theory about the separation of O'Reilly's fearful side (Brigid) from her aggressive side (Mayhem), following an experiment with some rats. During the ongoing criminal investigation into the disappearance of a number of girls into a sex trafficking ring,  Mayhem crashes a battle with a criminal gang and shoots nearly all the gang members. To save the last member's life, Cloak uses his powers to send her into the Darkforce Dimension. <ref>{{cite episode|title=Shadow Selves|series=Marvel's Cloak & Dagger|credits=Hastings, Matt (director); Kate Rorick & Marcus J.

Together Mayhem and Tandy find evidence of Connors' presence and endeavor to leave the Dimension, but Tandy accidentally exits the Dimension with Connors, leaving Mayhem behind. While in the Darkforce Dimension, Mayhem finds despair demon [[D'Spayre|Andre Deschaine/D'Spayre]] (who stores his victims' despair in the form of records in a record shop) and Voodoo priestess Chantelle Fusilier in the record shop. Chantelle sees Mayhem and signals her not to interfere. Later, while Andre is busy in the outside world, Mayhem starts smashing the records, releasing Tyrone from Andre's spell and giving him the motive to find the Viking Motel where Tandy is being held captive by Andre and his prostitution ring.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Vikingtown Sound|series=Marvel's Cloak & Dagger|credits=[[Joe Pokaski|Pokaski, Joe]] (director); [[Joe Pokaski]] (writer)|network=[[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]|airdate=May 10, 2019|season=2|number=7}}</ref> When in the Loa dimension, O'Reilly runs into Mayhem.
