'''Namor the Sub-Mariner''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|m|ɔːr}}) ('''Namor McKenzie''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Debuting in early 1939, the character was created by writer-artist [[Bill Everett]] for comic book packager [[Funnies Inc.]]. Initially created for the unreleased comic ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'', the character [[first appearance|first appeared]] publicly in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d Oct. 1939), which was the first comic book from [[Timely Comics]]; the 1930s–1940s predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]].

During that period, known to historians and fans as the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], the Sub-Mariner was one of Timely's top three characters, along with [[Captain America]] and the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]].

The [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] son of a human sea captain and a princess of the mythical undersea kingdom of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]], Namor possesses the super-strength and aquatic abilities of the ''[[Homo mermanus]]'' race, as well as the mutant ability of flight, along with other superhuman powers. Through the years, he has been portrayed as an antihero alternately from a good-natured but short-fused superhero or a hostile invader seeking vengeance for perceived wrongs that misguided surface-dwellers committed against his kingdom. The first known comic book [[antihero]], the Sub-Mariner has remained a historically important and relatively popular Marvel character.  He has served directly with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]], the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], the [[X-Men]] and the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] as well as serving as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to them on occasion.

So when Funnies Inc. packaged Marvel Comics #1 for Martin Goodman, Everett added four pages to his story, which finally saw print in color."}}</ref> The only eight known samples among those created to send to theater owners were discovered in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974.

===Golden Age===
[[Image:Marvel Mystery Comics 4.png|199px|left|thumb|Namor's first cover appearance: ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #4 (Feb. 1940). Art by [[Alex Schomburg]].]]
In his first appearances Namor was an enemy of the United States. Comics historian [[Les Daniels]] noted that "Namor was a freak in the service of chaos. Although the Sub-Mariner acted like a villain, his cause had some justice, and readers reveled in his assaults on civilization. His enthusiastic fans weren't offended by the carnage he created as he wrecked everything from ships to skyscrapers."<ref>{{harvnb|Daniels|1991|p=27}}</ref> Everett's antihero would eventually battle [[Carl Burgos]]' [[Android (robot)|android]] superhero, the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], when in 1940 Namor threatened to sink the island of Manhattan underneath a tidal wave.<ref>{{harvnb|Maslon|Kantor|2013|p=136}}</ref> When the U.S. entered [[World War II]], Namor would aid the [[Allies of World War II]] against [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Axis powers]].<ref>{{harvnb|DeFalco|Brevoort|Manning|Sanderson|2008|p=18|loc=chpt. "1940s"|ps=: "Alex's Schomburg's powerful cover [to ''Sub-Mariner Comics'' #1] significantly showed Namor employing his incredible strength to overturn a German submarine full of Nazi soldiers."}}</ref> Supporting characters included Betty Dean, a [[New York City Police Department|New York City policewoman]] introduced in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #3<ref>{{harvnb|DeFalco|Brevoort|Manning|Sanderson|2008|p=16|loc=chpt.

Namor starred in the Golden Age comic book ''Sub-Mariner Comics'', published quarterly, then thrice-yearly, and finally bimonthly, from issues #1–32 (Fall 1941 – June 1949).<ref>{{cite web |title=Sub-Mariner Comics |url=https://www.comics.org/series/239/ |publisher=[[Grand Comics Database]] |accessdate=August 31, 2019 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20190902171855/https://www.comics.org/series/239/ |archivedate=August 31, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> A backup feature each issue starred the detective-superhero the [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]]. Along with many other Timely characters, Namor disappeared a few years after the end of World War II and the decline in popularity of superhero comics.<ref>{{harvnb|DeFalco|Brevoort|Manning|Sanderson|2008|p=41|loc=chpt. "1940s"|ps=: "This final issue [#32 (June 1949)] of the 1940s ''Sub-Mariner Comics'' series presented [Bill] Everett's new retelling of [the character's origin].}}</ref> He briefly fought crime as a member of the post-war superhero team the [[All-Winners Squad]], and, through a 1970s [[retroactive continuity|retcon]], was given a history of having fought with the Allies during World War II in the superhero team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]. Both these super-groups were built around the core of Namor, Captain America, and the original Human Torch.

The Sub-Mariner experienced a brief revival in the mid-1950s at [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s iteration of Marvel. Along with Captain America and the original Human Torch, he was revived in ''Young Men'' #24. Soon afterward, ''Sub-Mariner Comics'' was revived with issues #33–42 (April 1954 – Oct. 1955).<ref>{{cite web |title=Sub-Mariner - 1954 series |url=https://www.comics.org/series/1052/ |publisher=[[Grand Comics Database]] |accessdate=September 2, 2019 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20190902174336/https://www.comics.org/series/1052/ |archivedate=September 2, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|DeFalco|Brevoort|Manning|Sanderson|2008|p=58|loc=chpt.

A planned live-action television program starring Namor did not appear and the revival of the comic book series was cancelled a second time.<ref name="Brevoort61">{{harvnb|DeFalco|Brevoort|Manning|Sanderson|2008|p=61|loc=chpt. "1950s"|ps=: "Martin Goodman had been in talks with television executives about turning Namor's adventures into a live-action TV series, reportedly to star actor Richard Egan.

===Silver Age===
Namor returned in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #4 (May 1962), where a member of the titular superhero team, Johnny Storm, the new [[Human Torch]], discovers him living as an [[amnesia]]c [[homelessness|homeless]] man in the [[Bowery]] section of [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{harvnb|DeFalco|Brevoort|Manning|Sanderson|2008|p=86|loc=chpt.

Finding it destroyed from [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear testing]], Namor assumes his people are scattered and that he will never find them. He again becomes an [[antihero]] during this period, as two elements – a thirst for vengeance and a quest for identity – would dominate the Sub-Mariner stories of the 1960s. He was both a villain and a hero – striking against the human race who destroyed his home, but showing a great deal of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' to individuals.<ref>{{harvnb|Benton|1991|pp=17–18}}</ref>

Initially, Namor variously finds himself allied with the [[supervillain]]s [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], but his royal nobility and stubborn independent streak make these alliances-of-convenience short-lived. Namor's revival was a hit with readers, but Marvel could not give him his own title due to publication and distribution restrictions that would not be lifted until 1968.<ref name="Back27"/> Instead, Namor was given numerous guest-appearances – including in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #7 (April 1965), a rare superhero story drawn by comics great [[Wally Wood]] – and a starring feature in the split-title comic ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' (beginning issue #70, Aug. 1965).<ref>{{harvnb|DeFalco|Brevoort|Manning|Sanderson|2008|p=109|loc=chpt. "1960s"|ps=: "Prince Namor replaced Giant-Man as the lead feature in ''Tales to Astonish'' #70. The Sub-Mariner series was written by Stan Lee and drawn by Gene Colan, who was using the pen name Adam Austin at the time."}}</ref> By now, during a period fans and historians call the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], he is more authoritative, arrogant and solemn than the impetuous youthful character of the 1940s and mid-1950s, speaking in neo-[[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] dialogue rather than the more [[colloquialism|colloquial]] speech of his youth, often shouting his battle cry, "Imperius Rex!".

===Bronze Age===
He was spun off into his own title, the 1968–74 series ''Sub-Mariner''.<ref name=gcd1968>{{cite web |title=Sub-Mariner - 1968 series |url=https://www.comics.org/series/1874/ |publisher=[[Grand Comics Database]] |accessdate=September 3, 2019 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20190903232500/https://www.comics.org/series/1874/ |archivedate=September 3, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The super-villain [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]] was introduced in issue #5 by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[John Buscema]]<ref>{{harvnb|DeFalco|Brevoort|Manning|Sanderson|2008|p=131|loc=chpt.

By now more of a reluctant superhero "the Sub-Mariner was perfect for the Marvel Age of angst-ridden protagonists. Noble yet misunderstood, powerful yet thwarted ... [he was] portrayed as a regal monarch – a king without a country."<ref>{{harvnb|Benton|1991|pp=100}}</ref> The final issue,  #72 (Sept. 1974), was written by [[Steve Skeates]] and featured an unofficial [[intercompany crossover]] with the last issue of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Aquaman]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web |last1=May |first1=Michael |title=CCI: That '70s (Creators) Panel |url=https://www.cbr.com/cci-that-70s-creators-panel/ |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |publisher=Valnet Inc. |accessdate=September 3, 2019 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20190903233158/https://www.cbr.com/cci-that-70s-creators-panel/ |archivedate=September 3, 2019 |date=August 1, 2012 |quote=[Mark] Evanier asked what work from that period the writer is most proud of. Skeates replied that he was pleased with the experimentation he'd started doing in the last four issues of ''Aquaman'' and talked a little about the unofficial Aquaman/Sub-Mariner crossover he'd been allowed to write for Marvel. Since ''Aquaman'' had been cancelled abruptly on a cliffhanger, Roy Thomas let Skeates wrap up the story in a fill-in issue of ''Sub-Mariner''. |url-status=live}}</ref> A five- to six-page backup feature, "Tales of Atlantis", chronicling the undersea kingdom from its ancient origins, appeared in issues #62–66 (June–Oct. 1973), written by Gerber, with penciling by [[Howard Chaykin]] and later [[Jim Mooney]].<ref name=gcd1968 /> After the cancellation of ''Sub-Mariner'', Namor co-starred with Doctor Doom in the ''[[Super-Villain Team-Up]]'' series.<ref>{{harvnb|DeFalco|Brevoort|Manning|Sanderson|2008|p=168|loc=chpt.

Marvel published a four-issue [[miniseries]] a decade later, ''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' (Sept.-Dec. 1984), by scripter/co-plotter [[J. M. DeMatteis]], penciler/co-plotter [[Bob Budiansky]], and inker Danny Bulanadi.<ref name="back91">{{cite magazine |last1=Lantz |first1=James Heath |date=September 2016 |title=Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner: Scion of the Deep or Royal Pain? |format= |language= |magazine=[[Back Issue!]] |location=[[Raleigh, North Carolina]], [[United States]] |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |volume=1 |issue=91 |pages=50–62 |via= |subscription= |quote=}}</ref>

===Modern Age===
The 12-issue [[maxiseries]] ''The Saga of the Sub-Mariner'' (Nov. 1988 – Oct. 1989) provided a retrospective of Namor's past adventures while tying up loose plot threads and resolving contradictions that had accumulated over the character's decades of published history.<ref name="Back27"/> Namor again received an ongoing series in 1990. ''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'', which ran 62 issues (April 1990 – May 1995), was initially written and penciled by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] who took over the inking as well from issues #4–21.<ref>{{harvnb|DeFalco|Brevoort|Manning|Sanderson|2008|p=248|loc=chpt. "1990s"|ps=: "Comics superstar John Byrne revamped the classic Marvel character Namor in this new series that he both wrote and drew."}}</ref> Unlike all of Namor's previous series, the cover logo emphasized the character's name rather than the "Sub-Mariner" epithet.<ref name="back91"/> From #26–38, the series' penciler and eventual penciler-inker was then-newcomer [[Jae Lee]], with [[Bob Harras]] scripting from #33–40. After three fill-in issues, the remainder of the series was written by [[Glenn Herdling]] and pencilled by [[Geof Isherwood]]. This series followed Namor as CEO of Oracle, Inc., a corporation devoted to reducing pollution, particularly in the oceans, and provided the stage for the return of the 1970s [[martial artist]] superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], who had been presumed dead. Whereas J. M. DeMatteis saw his series as an opportunity to explore Namor much more deeply than he had been able to in the team book ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', John Byrne felt that the character did not work well outside of a group context and accordingly gave ''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' a massive supporting cast.<ref name="back91"/>

The 12-issue miniseries ''Namor'' (June 2003 – May 2004), credited to co-writers [[Bill Jemas]] (then Marvel's president) and [[Andi Watson]], and penciled initially by [[Salvador Larroca]] and later by [[Pat Olliffe]] and others, explored Namor's youth, charting his teenage romance with a young American girl in the early 20th century. A six-issue miniseries, ''Sub-Mariner'' vol. 2 (Aug. 2007 – Jan. 2008), by co-writers Matt Cherniss and Peter Johnson and, primarily, artist Phil Briones, introduced Namor's heretofore undisclosed son, Kamar.

Namor was featured in his own ongoing series, ''Namor: The First Mutant'', in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=Marvel Announces Namor Ongoing Series |url=https://www.newsarama.com/5278-marvel-announces-namor-ongoing-series.html |website=[[Newsarama]] |publisher=[[Purch Group]] |accessdate=September 4, 2019 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20190904151054/https://www.newsarama.com/5278-marvel-announces-namor-ongoing-series.html |archivedate=September 4, 2019 |date=May 13, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The series was cancelled after less than a year into its publication.<ref name="Tramountanas">{{cite web |last1=Tramountanas |first1=George A. |title=X-Position: Stuart Moore Swims with ''Namor'' |url=https://www.cbr.com/x-position-stuart-moore-swims-with-namor/ |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |publisher=Valnet Inc. |accessdate=September 4, 2019 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20190904151250/https://www.cbr.com/x-position-stuart-moore-swims-with-namor/ |archivedate=September 4, 2019 |date=April 12, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Namor was born in 1915 in the capital city of the initially unnamed Atlantean empire, then located off the [[Antarctic]] coast. His mother was Emperor Thakorr's daughter, Fen, and his father an American sea captain, Leonard McKenzie, of the icebreaker ''Oracle''; they had fallen in love and married aboard ship while she was, unbeknownst to him, spying on the human intruders. When Fen did not return, Atlantean warriors attacked the ''Oracle'', evidently killing McKenzie, and returned Fen to her kingdom. The pink-skinned [[mutant (comics)|mutant]] Namor was subsequently born among the blue-skinned Atlanteans. He became the Prince of Atlantis, and a warrior for his people against the "surface-dwellers".<ref>{{cite comic |cartoonist=[[Bill Everett]] |story=The Sub-Mariner |title=[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=October 2, 1939 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location= |page= |panel= |id=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Roy Thomas]] & [[Dann Thomas]] |penciller=[[Rich Buckler]] |inker=[[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]] |colorist=Michael Higgins |letterer=[[Joe Rosen]] |editor=[[Terry Kavanagh]] & Mike Rockwitz |story=A Legend A-Borning |title=Saga of the Sub-Marine |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=November 1988 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location= |page= |panel= |id=}}</ref>

At some point, when Namor was a child, the people of Atlantis relocated and built a new kingdom near the [[Pacific Northwest]]. There, Namor would befriend a young girl named Sandy Pierce, the daughter of wealthy businessman Henry Pierce.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Andi Watson]] |penciller=[[Salvador Larroca]] |inker=Danni Miki |colorist=J.

====''The Best Defense''====
The maddened Namor would venture to seek other avenues of consolidating a solid war power while defending the oceans from surface dwellers. While the Defenders of the Deep deal with Hydropolis, Namor would seek out a long defected splinter sect of Atlanteans known as the Vodani to fortify his war on the hated airbreathers, but they had long since sequestered themselves far from the Earth's oceans and onto another planet. Something Namor wouldn't find out til after he went searching for them, unknowingly stumbling onto a plot by demons to destroy the earth for profit. Namor would seek to make an alliance with the Atlantean castaways to bolster his armies. He was lead to believe by vanquishing an old foe of their society, they would consider Namor's proposal. But the task of slaying a creature to gain their trust was a snark hunt. A ruse set up by the Vodani King Okun to leave him more vulnerable to a sneak attack they had in store for Namor whether he succeeded or failed. As the Vodani and Okun had grown to despise anything related to what they came to see as impure Atlanteans, opting to kill them on sight rather than parley with them. A furious Namor would do battle with Okun, but found himself to be quickly outmatched and was on the verge of dying. Until he took advantage of certain insights he learned using a portal which lead to the Vodani's homeworld from Earth, flying his hateful adversary into the vacuous depths of space where he would suffocate and die, as would have Namor himself if not for the unexpected arrival in the form of a [[Silver Surfer|cosmic godsend]]. Finding aid in an old colleague from his days on the Defenders, Namor learns from Silver Surfer about an old enemy having become a universal threat which is now heading towards the Sol Star System. To feed a cosmic entity known as the Conductor's engine of destruction [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]] who has parasitically latched onto it via a devils deal conducted by rogue agents of hell, is directing its cosmic furnace towards Vodon to use it to stoke its fire.<ref>''Namor: The Best Defense'' (Dec, 2018) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Unbeknownst to Namor however, a time-tossed Doctor Strange and Hulk were also involved with the calamity sparked by hell and the demon possessed adversary. While on their end, Namor would make a sacrifice to Okun's daughter Kataw he had killed. Both to save the planet after it was hurled from its orbit as well as undermine its new queen and forge the alliance he had sought in the first place. But the scorned Kataw rebuked his request and uses her power over bio-electricity to fuel the Silver Surfer for the purpose of sending the planet Vodan into a star system with no planets to keep it from freezing to death. His plan now despoiled by his exile from their world, Namor returns to Earth to resume his war with the land dwellers after jokingly citing how the Non-Team up of the Defenders had saved it from annihilation. He then quotes to Silver Surfer that they should all get together and eat shawarma sometime.<ref>''Defenders: The Best Defense'' (Feb, 2019) Vol. 1 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====''Invaders''====
Namor would again prep to assimilate Atlantean outliers into his military outfit, this time seeking a sect of shock-troopers known as the '''Sea Blades''' whom defected from Atlantis over a decade ago due to their future king's surface heritage. They found yet another separatist sect whom they had intermingled with while sequestered away from the main city. As the Sea Blades prepped to assail their returned leader, Namor showcased his newfound water-shifting abilities by parting the oceans and leaving the Sea Blades and their leader to asphyxiate unless they ceded leadership to him. After said altercation, he would go over his war plans with the ingratiated marine admiral Karris as the rest of his forces made their pilgrimage back to Atlantis. So awestruck was the once disavowing naval enforcer that he immediately signed on with Namor's plan to change the world.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Chip Zdarsky|penciller= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|inker= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|title= Invaders|Volume= 3|issue= 1|date= January 16, 2019}}</ref>

Revealing that in secret with his guide Marchen which only Namor can see and interact with. Namor's Atlantean technicians have been fabricating some kind of bomb that will target specific human DNA.

When his former friend Captain America presented himself to the Atlanteans to broker an agreement with Namor, he attacked Captain America in a rage while ranting about how Atlantis has taken the heat of the surface world's battles time and time again. Once more showcasing his power over the water by parting the oceans after shattering Roger's breathing helmet, Namor lets Steve go while telling him the next time they met, there would be no mercy.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Chip Zdarsky|penciller= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|inker= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|title= Invaders|Volume= 3|issue= 2|date= February 27, 2019}}</ref>

The now deranged sea king is further coaxed by his mental instability, secretly conversing with Roman Peterson; Nay Peterson's only son, both of whom are working as a covert agents in Namor's employ. Deploying his long secreted biochemical weapon transforming countless homo sapiens into homo mermanus genetics through private channels.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Chip Zdarsky|penciller= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|inker= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|title= Invaders|Volume= 3|issue= 5|date= May 8, 2019}}</ref>

He immediately went on the warpath dispatching Cap by tossing him into the deep ocean, simultaneously dealing with Hammond whom went to save him, but as he Saw Randall dying of geriatric complications the two had a short conversation before the senior citizen passed away. Causing the former to fly away in tears.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Chip Zdarsky|penciller= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|inker= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|title= Invaders|Volume= 3|issue= 3|date= March 27, 2019}}</ref>

With everything prepped and ready Namor's plan begins to unfold, intercepting Hammond over the skyline of Boston, Maine where he summarily decapitates the android to so Roman can launch a missile strike against Atlantis.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Chip Zdarsky|penciller= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|inker= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|title= Invaders|Volume= 3|issue= 4|date= April 27, 2019}}</ref>

Captain America makes it onto the scene too late while the Avengers make a failed incursion attempt on the sunken city, while battling his former friend Namor reveals this was all part of his grand plan however. Using Atlantean spies within the American government to instigate a retaliatory response, Atlantis launching their own missile strike as an intended consequence.<ref name="Invaders #5">{{cite comic| writer= Chip Zdarsky|penciller= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|inker= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|title= Invaders|Volume= 3|issue= 5|date= May 8, 2019}}</ref>

Unleashing the chemical dispersal he and other's had been working on for decades turning many across the seaboard into water breathers while the Avengers act in defense of the kingdom in his absence.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Chip Zdarsky|penciller= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|inker= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|title= Invaders|Volume= 3|issue= 6|date= June 12, 2019}}</ref>

Namor sits alone with his thoughts while the world assembly debates the threat his kingdom and their latest designs presents. Machan continues to push the addled ocean lord to pursue his demented quest, but Namor is baffled by news of transformed Russian citizens into Atlanteans making their way to his domain as he never sanctioned it.<ref name="Invaders #5"/> 

The weary Namor questions Machan as the mental manifest was working without Namor's consent again, Namor argues with his mania just as an emissary of the search team return with an item of interest his liege might require. The latter saying that the [[Serpent Crown]] will stabilize the fragility in his fractured psyche as they prepare to strike down approaching enemies before they can attack.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Chip Zdarsky|penciller= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|inker= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|title= Invaders|Volume= 3|issue= 7|date= July 17, 2019}}</ref>

Feeling uncomfortable in his own skin, Namor would make contact with his former associate Bucky. Inviting him to meet at a local tavern to discuss things. The latter is naturally untrusting, given that Namor's infiltrators shot Barnes in the back of the head with his own gun, all while stealing necessary components for his latest doomsday project. Namor comes clean about his mental problems and how he's barely in control of his actions anymore, revealing to the Winter Soldier that for the longest time. The psychic apparition of Thomas Marchen has been indirectly pushing his latest agenda for decades since his abrupt falling out with Charles X. Using the DNA of a mutant gene morph to fabricate the chemical agent which he and his soldiers used to convert people across the globe in various cities into Atlanteans whom he'd suborn into his underwater nation. But after Namor had another violent episode, Bucky reveals he'd brought support in the guise of Susan Storm of the Fantastic Four to subdue him. Namor then revealed his newfound power bestowed by his latest acquisition, using the Serpent Crown to weaken Sue's hold on him with her powers. He would regain a second wind, telekinetically flinging the Invisible Woman aside while snaring Bucky in a water bubble. Whispering the full extent of his plan before flying off to parts unknown.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Chip Zdarsky|penciller= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|inker= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|title= Invaders|Volume= 3|issue= 8|date= August 14, 2019}}</ref>

Somewhere in the Atlantic Trench, Namor has his forces tear into seaside cliffs in order to extract tons of rock for an unknown purpose. After sending his faithful ward Roman back to Atlantis for wartime preparations Marchen shows his increasing distaste in his liege's way of doing things particularly when the master plan is so close to fruition. But the submariner rebukes his mental haze stating that he is king and so long as he has the Serpent Crown, his war ghost will continue to do as he is told. While attacking a Roxxon oil rig, he questions why Atlantean forces are slaughtering indiscriminately when he'd only ordered them to dismantle the mining facility. To his shock & agitation, Marchen has been secretly using the Crown broadcast other orders behind Namor's back again. After fighting against the Invaders for a little bit Namor retreats back into the sea in order to confront his apparition, but is surprised to find Roman Peterson waiting for him instead. The hallucination of Thomas reveals to his lesser half that he was no longer a manifestation of Namor's guilt and rage but was now his own entity. Despite his influence however he could not completely subsume Namor's humanity which is why he secretly ordered the acquisition of the Serpent Crown, so he could transfer himself from Namor's mind into that of his protege; Roman Peterson, to act upon what his king will not.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Chip Zdarsky|penciller= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|inker= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|title= Invaders|Volume= 3|issue= 9|date= September 11, 2019}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Because of his unusual genetic heritage, Namor is unique among both ordinary humans and Atlanteans; he is sometimes referred to as "Marvel's first mutant" because, while the majority of his observed superhuman powers come from the fact that he is a hybrid of human and Atlantean DNA, his ability to fly cannot be explained by either side (Atlanteans are an offshoot of "baseline" humanity); though, in terms of in-continuity chronology, there were many mutants in existence before Namor. Namor possesses a fully amphibious physiology suited for extreme undersea pressures, superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, flight, and longevity. Namor has the ability to survive underwater for indefinite periods, and specially developed vision which gives him the ability to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean.

Bill Everett, in his first Sub-Mariner story, described the character as "an ultra-man of the deep [who] lives on land and in the sea, flies in the air, [and] has the strength of a thousand [surface] men". No other powers were mentioned. When the series was revived in 1954<!--issue #33 cover-dated April 1954-->, Namor lost his ankle wings and with them the power of flight; they, and his full strength, were restored in ''Sub-Mariner Comics'' #38 (Feb. 1955), in which Everett additionally wrote a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] story, "Wings on His Feet", detailing their appearance on Namor at age 14. This story was twice reprinted during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #17 (Nov. 1968), and in the book ''Comix'' by [[Les Daniels]].

Namor has the ability to swim at superhuman speeds, even by Atlantean standards.

Namor has greater longevity than a normal human being. He is nearly 100 years old as he was born in 1920 in the Marvel timeline, but has the appearance of a male in his prime. His identity as a pre–World War II superhero is well-established, making him less subject to the [[floating timeline|sliding timescale]] of the Marvel universe.

During Namor's original fight with the Human Torch in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #8 (June 1940, and the first fight between superheroes to appear in any media), Namor was able to forcibly expel water from his body to extinguish fires, although it proved useless against the Torch.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Bill Everett|Everett, Bill]]|penciller= Everett, Bill|inker= Everett, Bill|story= The Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner Meet|title= [[Marvel Mystery Comics]]|issue= 8|date= June 1940}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= [[Carl Burgos|Burgos, Carl]]|penciller= Burgos, Carl|inker= Burgos, Carl|story= The Search For Sub-Mariner|title= Marvel Mystery Comics|issue= 8 |date= June 1940}}</ref>

After he was revived yet again in the 1960s by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, Namor demonstrated powers of various sealife that had not been shown in earlier stories.  An editorial note in ''[[Marvel Tales]]'' #9 (July 1967), stated explicitly that "nautical Namor has since lost his power to imitate the characteristics of fish..." According to one of Sub-Mariner's scripters, Roy Thomas: "As for Namor's electrical and other sea-creaturely powers. They were used in one or two stories in ''F.F.'' and the Human Torch series in ''Strange Tales'', then dropped – as one of Stan [Lee] and Jack [Kirby]s early (and quite forgivable) mistakes. The explanation, given in a reprint of a Torch/Namor bout a few years later, was that he had these powers only for a short time and then lost them."<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy|story= Okay, Axis, Here We Come! (text article)|title= The Invaders|issue= 35|date= December 1978}}</ref> He sporadically showcases enhanced senses having eyesight that enables seeing in the deepest ocean depths, hear when a school of fish turn a corner from a world away and even feel when the deepest currents change by the slightest degree.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Jonathan Maberry|penciller= Ken Lashley|inker= Paul Neary|story= Prelude to Doomwar|title= Black Panther|Volume= 5|issue= 11|date= December 2009}}</ref>

In all his incarnations, Namor possesses superhuman strength and, with the possible exceptions of [[Orka (comics)|Orka]] and [[Tyrak]] at their full sizes, is the strongest Atlantean ever known. The exact level of his strength is dependent upon his physical contact with water, in which he needn't be submerged. It has been shown as sufficient to effortlessly toss a water-filled ocean-liner, despite the underwater [[viscosity]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Christian Cooper|Cooper, Chris]]|penciller= [[Doug Wheatley|Wheatley, Doug]]|inker= Wheatley, Doug|story= Lifesblood|title= Hulk / Sub-Mariner '98 |issue= 1|date= 1998}}</ref> His strength diminishes slowly the longer he is out of contact with water, though an extended period on land does not result in his death, as it would for a typical Atlantean, and his power is retained in full as long as he keeps himself wet. Namor possesses superhuman stamina and resistance to injury due to his hybrid nature. Namor's strength level is such that he has held his own in hand-to-hand combat with beings as powerful as the [[Hulk]] in the past.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Herb Trimpe|Trimpe, Herb]]|inker= Trimpe, Herb|story= A Clash of Titans|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 118|date= August 1969}}</ref>

Some stories have mentioned that Namor has gills for breathing underwater, e.g., in ''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #5, Namor thinks "this New York river water burns my gills and scalds my lungs".<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Byrne, John|story= All the Rivers Burning!|title= Namor, the Sub-Mariner|issue= 5|date= August 1990}}</ref> and artists such as [[Salvador Larroca]] have drawn him with gill slits on either side of his neck.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/10988/ ''Namor''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> In ''The Sub-Mariner'' #18–22 (1969–70), beings from outer space surgically closed Namor's gills for a time, leaving him with the ability to breathe air but unable to breathe underwater. Other sources have stated that his lungs contain oxygen diffusing membranes that allow him to breathe underwater.

Namor possesses a telepathic rapport with all forms of marine life. He is able to mentally communicate with most forms of Ichthyoid, Cephalopod, Plankton, Anthozoa, Csnidarian, etc; and can mentally persuade them to do his bidding. Namor can mentally communicate with other Atlanteans and give mental-telepathic orders to all his men.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Everett, Bill|penciller= Everett, Bill|inker= Everett, Bill|story= The Serum Must Get Through!|title= [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]|issue= 4|date= Spring 1941}}</ref>

Due to a unique aspect of his hybrid nature, not shared by [[Namorita]], it was theorized that Namor is vulnerable to oxygen imbalances in his blood that trigger manic-depressive mood swings; he can prevent imbalances by regular immersion in water.

Namor gives off a sense of charisma which most women tend to find captivating.  Many of the ladies that have entered his life made clear their attraction to his masculine, slightly alien personality in ways both subtle and blatant.  He reacts to such advances with gratitude tinged with a slight distance born of monarchical etiquette.

Namor is a natural leader, trained by the royal family of Atlantis as befitting an heir to the throne.  He has historically led troops into battle with expert success.  His typical interpersonal behavior with both subject and friend borders on the aloof; this is more a sense of regal ''noblesse oblige'' rather than snobbishness.

Namor was given possession of the [[Infinity Gems|Time Gem]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael; Reed, Brian|penciller= [[Jim Cheung|Cheung, Jim]]|inker= [[Mark Morales (comics)|Morales, Mark]]|story= This...is an Infinity Gem|title= New Avengers: Illuminati|issue= 2|date= March 2007}}</ref> This gem allows the user total control over the past, present, and future. It allows time travel, can age and de-age beings, and can be used as a weapon by trapping enemies or entire worlds in unending loops of time. After the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] attempted to steal the Gems, Namor briefly helped Thor recover the Gem from the bottom of the ocean to prevent the Hood acquiring it, before being entrusted with the Power Gem as the Gems were divided amongst the new Illuminati – Steve Rogers replacing Black Bolt – once again.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Romita Jr., John|inker= [[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]]|story= My name is Thanos|title= The Avengers|volume= 4|issue= 12|date= June 2011}}</ref>

Later publications depict Namor being vastly more powerful than ever before. He is shown to be physically strong enough and tough enough to battle the all-new roster of Avengers and win singlehandedly.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Jason Aaron|penciller= David Marquez|inker= David Marquez|story= Defenders of the Deep|title= Avengers|Volume= 8|issue= 9|date= October 10, 2018}}</ref> Easily able to physically match the might of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Iron Man]], take a direct cosmic charged blow from [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]], survive a point blank gamma blast from the newly empowered [[She-Hulk]] and recover from getting run over by the Hellcharger of [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Ghost Rider]] almost instantly. Another addition to his abilities is his power over water itself, having somehow absorbed the abilities of Hydro-Man and put them to better used than he ever did. Using his hydrokinesis to flood a prison cell of Roxxon enforcers miles away from the ocean through the facility complex's sewage line,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Jason Aaron|penciller= David Marquez|inker= David Marquez|story= Defenders of the Deep|title= Avengers|Volume= 8|issue= 9|date= October 10, 2018}}</ref> and again when he went to conscript a long since defected Atlantean sect in preparation for war on the surface world, literally parting the seas around their own kingdom only to drop the waters back into place.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Chip Zdarsky|penciller= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|inker= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|title= Invaders|Volume= 3|issue= 1|date= January 16, 2019}}</ref>

Namor was educated by the royal tutors of the Atlantean court, and speaks English, Atlantean, and Lemurian. He is a highly skilled business executive. On top of having a slew of vast Atlantean technologies available to him and his forces,<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 3 #44 (September, 2006)</ref><ref>''Sub-Mariner'' Vol. 2 #1-6 (2007-2008)</ref><ref>''X-Men: Red'' Vol. 1 #44 (Apr, 2018)</ref> Namor also has a slew of powerful mystical relics in his national treasury he regularly makes use of; like the Trident of Neptune, patron weapon of his kingdom's founding sea god Poseidon.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' Vol. 1 #70 (Aug, 1965)</ref> 

The weapon supposedly comes with many replicas as an adversary whom held the sea king in resentment due to prior infractions he had in the past utilized a true oceanic scepter while Namor held only a ceremonial copy.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' Vol. 1 #75 (Jan, 1966)</ref> Said recipient would study up on the lore of Atlantis's mythical, mystical background and discovered a hidden treasure cove pertaining to numerous magical relics in the ocean deity's possession.

In the past Namor has interacted with the [[Serpent Crown]] throughout his adventures, in later publishing he has regained access to all of its supernatural facilities in order to augment his own powers.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Chip Zdarsky|penciller= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|inker= Carlos Magno, Butch Guice|title= Invaders|Volume= 3|issue= 7|date= July 17, 2019}}</ref>

===Formerly depicted abilities===
In ''The Fantastic Four'' #9 (Dec. 1962), Namor states, "I have the powers of all the creatures who live beneath the sea! I can charge the very air with electricity – using the power of the electric eel!"  In the same issue, "the radar sense of the cave fish from the lowest depths of the sea" enables him to sense the presence of Sue Storm when she is invisible. He uses "the power to surround himself with electricity in the manner of an electric eel" again in ''[[Strange Tales]]''  #107 (April 1963), and #125 (Oct. 1964); in the former he manifests the power to inflate his body like a puffer fish. These extra powers were ignored, when Marvel gave Namor his own feature beginning in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #70 (Aug. 1965).

Another ability unknown in the Golden Age and rarely displayed is his empathic rapport with many forms of marine life. He had a limited empathic rapport with Namorita, but only as a result of being given one of her "magic earrings" (which has long since disappeared).

An editorial note in ''[[Marvel Tales]]'' #9 (July 1967), which reprinted the story from ''Strange Tales'' #107, stated explicitly that "nautical Namor has since lost his power to imitate the characteristics of fish..."  His electrical abilities were seen out of comic continuity in 1991's ''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game]]''. Furthermore, Namor employed these "lost" powers semi-regularly in his 1990s series, under John Byrne's pen. In ''[[Marvel Mystery]]'' #2 (Dec. 1939) Namor once boasted a personal hydration function of his physiology, once extinguishing a pedestrian had been set on fire by cigarette light. His body excreted water from his individual pores, dousing the flames.

=="Marvel's first mutant"==
Marvel has repeatedly identified Namor as "Marvel's first mutant", which is true with regard to the order in which the character appeared in print.  He is not the oldest mutant within the fictional [[Marvel Universe]] timeline. A number of mutants predate him, including [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] (active since at least 10,000 BC), [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] (born in the 30th century BC), [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] (born in the 12th century AD), [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] (late 19th century AD), [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] (dates of birth unknown, but known to have been active at the "Dawn of the 20th century"), the demonic mutant [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]], and a group of mutants known as the [[Externals]].

In ''X-Men'' #6<!-- W:MOS: vol. 1 not labeled, only subsequent volumes --> (July 1964), [[X-Men]] leader Professor Xavier and antagonist Magneto each suspect Namor is a mutant and make efforts to recruit him. Later writers in the 1960s and 1970s described him as a hybrid, not a mutant, to distinguish him from the mutant X-Men.<ref>As explained in the letters page of ''Sub-Mariner'' #31 (November 1970)</ref> When the series was revived in 1990, the series title logo carried the subtitle "Marvel's first and mightiest mutant!".

Namor is actually a hybrid of Atlantean and human physiology, although he has principal characteristics that neither Atlanteans (''Homo mermanus'') nor humans (''Homo sapiens'') possess. These include his ability to fly, and possibly his durability and strength (which is several times that of an Atlantean).

In the first issue of the five-part ''Illuminati'' miniseries, after being experimented on by the Skrulls, it was confirmed that Namor is not only an Atlantean/human hybrid but also a mutant.

==Enemies==
* [[Attuma]] – Leader of the Atlantean barbarians, Attuma would threaten Atlantis repeatedly; conquering it on several occasions, and became Namor's nemesis.
* [[Byrrah]] – Childhood friend and rival to Namor, Byrrah was Atlantean royalty that lost the throne to Namor and observed him as unfit for the position.

* [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] – Using Namor as a pawn on several occasions, such as against the [[Fantastic Four]] and in obtaining funds, the Puppet Master would garner the ire of the sea king. On one occasion, when Namor considered befriending the [[Hulk]], Puppet Master took the green behemoth over and forced him to battle Namor.
* [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]] – An Olympic swimmer transformed by Doctor Dorcas into a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of Namor's DNA and a [[tiger shark]]. He battles Namor repeatedly over the years, at one time an ally to the sea king, though today he has again chosen to be his enemy.

* [[Krang (Marvel Comics)|Warlord Krang]] – One-time military leader of Atlantis' forces, Krang tried to usurp Namor's power and became an enemy to the kingdom. He would return repeatedly to challenge Namor.

==Other versions==

===Marvel Noir===
In the ''[[Marvel Noir]]'' reality, Namor is a captain of a ship named "Dorma".<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|penciller= [[Manuel Garcia (comics)|Garcia, Manuel]]|inker= [[Lorenzo Ruggiero|Ruggiero, Lorenzo]]|title= [[Marvel Noir|Iron Man Noir]]|issue= 1|date= June 2010}}</ref> '''Captain Namor''' is a widely infamous pirate of the seven seas and an associate of [[Tony Stark]], who pays him for the numerous voyages on his adventures. Namor considers himself as a man of the sea and doesn't share any allegiances to any countries or nations. As part of his tradition as a pirate, Namor marks himself and his crew by slicing their ears to look like shark's fins. He is the captain of the Dorma, an advanced submarine while taking the guise of a fishing trawler.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Snyder, Scott|penciller= Garcia, Manuel|inker= Ruggiero, Lorenzo|title= Iron Man Noir|issue= 2|date= July 2010}}</ref>

In May 1939, Stark hired Namor to find the location of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]]. He traveled with Stark, [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], and [[Pepper Potts]] on the submersible, the "Happy Hogan", in locating Atlantis and finding the valuable Orichalcum. Upon returning to the surface, Namor and his friends were immediately captured by the [[Nazis]] led by [[Baron Zemo]] and [[Baron Strucker|Von Strucker]], and the Orichalcum stolen by them. Namor and his allies were then left to die on his trawler by torpedo; Namor took action in having everyone quickly board the Dorma and escape before the torpedo destroyed the trawler. Namor later rescued Stark following the destruction of Von Strucker's airship fleet, as (in Namor's words) Stark owes him a boat for the destruction of his.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Snyder, Scott|penciller= Garcia, Manuel|inker= Ruggiero, Lorenzo|title= Iron Man Noir|issue= 4|date= September 2010}}</ref>

===MC2===
Namor is still active in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] future timeline, and still uniting occasionally for battle alongside the [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#MC-2|Hulk]] and Doctor Strange as "Defenders". His appearance, while slightly older looking, is unchanged save for growing a goatee. In ''[[Fantastic Five]]'' vol. 2 #1 it was revealed that he had held [[Alternative versions of Doctor Doom#MC2|Doctor Doom]] captive for over ten years after the mad monarch destroyed Atlantis. Doom subsequently escaped, and in #4, Namor is seen being tortured by him.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #24, the team is surveying the ruins of Atlantis and finds an estimated 9,000-year-old tomb containing the hibernating Namor – an imprisoned Atlantean criminal, considered the worst villain of his time.

His extreme intelligence allows him to become fluent in English in a matter of minutes merely by listening to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents and the Fantastic Four talking. Confronting the human, Namor withstands full-strength flares from the [[Alternative versions of the Human Torch#Ultimate Marvel|Human Torch]] and is strong enough to fight the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], withstand [[Invisible Woman#Ultimate Marvel|Sue Storm]]'s [[force shield|force fields]], and stretch Richards (Mr. Fantastic) to near-breaking. He destroys machinery designed to contain the Hulk. Though beaten by the Fantastic Four, he creates a tidal wave in the shape of [[Poseidon]], threatening to destroy [[Manhattan]] with it. He is appeased when he demands, and receives, a meaningful kiss from Sue Storm. He then returns to the sea.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Millar, Mark|penciller= Land, Greg|inker= Ryan, Matt|story= Tomb of Namor Part 2 of 3|title= Ultimate Fantastic Four|issue= 25|date= January 2006}}</ref>

When the characters arrive in his realm he is arguing with his cousin [[Namorita#1602|Rita]] (Namorita) about her reluctance to marry. She suggests that this is because he refuses to find a consort himself. Upon meeting the Four from the Fantastick, he is attracted to [[Invisible Woman#1602|Susan Storm]], and attempts to woo her, unsuccessfully. He later plots with [[Alternative versions of Doctor Doom#1602|Otto von Doom]] to win her, while "disposing" of [[Alternative versions of Mister Fantastic#1602|Sir Richard Reed]]. Doom turns against him, and Numenor is stabbed with his own [[trident]] and dies.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= Alixe, Pascal|inker= Livesay, John|title= Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four|issue= 4|date= February 2007}}</ref> Because Bensaylum is not underwater, its inhabitants are portrayed as basically human although they retain the pointed ears.
