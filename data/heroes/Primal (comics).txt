==Fictional character biography==

===The Fourth Light===
After rescuing Transonic, Velocidad, and Oya, Hope brought the group to the Ukraine to find the next Light.  However, by the time they arrived he had already moved on.  The group tracked Teon through Europe and eventually found him in Miami Beach.<ref name=GH8/> Like the others, Hope's touch stabilized his powers.<ref name=UXMEN529>''Uncanny X-Men'' #529</ref>  After his activation, he imprinted on Hope, following her commands.<ref name=UXMEN529/>  He typically communicates in single words that convey his desires - notably "fight," "flight," and "mate."

Teon accompanied the Lights to Tokyo to subdue Zero, whose powers had gone crazy.<ref name=GH1></ref> Soon thereafter, Teon and the other Lights followed Hope in moving to [[Asteroid_M#Fifth_version.2FUtopia|Utopia]]<ref name=GH4>''Generation Hope'' #4</ref> Upon arrival, he immediately began sparring [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], by whom he was eventually bested; Teon conceded that Wolverine was the "alpha."  Wolverine continues to spar with Teon.<ref name=GH6>''Generation Hope'' #6</ref>

Like the rest of the student-aged population, Teon takes classes taught by more experienced X-Men.<ref name=GH5>''Generation Hope'' #5 (2011)</ref>  However, he is more concerned with following Hope, and follows her after she abruptly walks out of an ethics class being taught by [[Emma Frost]]. He also trains with Hope and the rest of his new team in weapons and tactics.  [[Kavita Rao]] conducts intelligence tests on Teon and comes to believe that he is of low intelligence.<ref name=GH8>''Generation Hope'' #8</ref> Hope, however, demonstrates that he has normal if not high intelligence if given the correct incentive, but simply lacks the desire to complete his tests.

When Hope and the Lights went to retrieve the Sixth Light, Teon (along with Zero) seemed uniquely immune to the infant telepath's abilities, as he is able to move freely about without any protection. Additionally, he is the only one able to convince the infant child, via telepathy, that it should embrace life and be born. Hope touches the newborn child, and is able to suppress its X-Gene until it becomes older. The Lights' celebration is cut short, however, as their liaison [[Shadowcat]] reveals that Teon's parents have sued for custody of the boy.<ref>''Generation Hope'' vol. 1 #7</ref>

While both [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Evangeline Whedon]] both initially believe that Teon's case is hopeless, Teon surprises everyone by rushing the stand, and giving an eloquent, well-thought-out speech about how he has changed. He explains that the Teon his parents knew died when his X-Gene was activated, and asks his parents to find solace in the fact that he is now happier with Hope on Utopia than he would be at home. This speech wins Teon the right to stay on Utopia. Later, Zero wonders if Teon truly is happy, or if he is faking it to remain close to Hope.<ref>''Generation Hope'' vol. 1 #8</ref>

===Schism===
As Hope and Gabriel prepare to go on their first date, Teon is initially protective of Hope; she tells him to calm down, implying she can handle herself if Gabriel isn't a perfect gentleman.<ref>''Generation Hope'' vol. 1 #10</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Teon has a primal mutation that enhances all of his physical abilities.<ref name=GH4/>  Teon also possesses a type of "hyperinstinct" which allows him to process the world in the most efficient manner.<ref name=GH8/> He has competently demonstrated that he is fully capable of parsing effectively complex ideas (even being able to appear at a legal hearing and give a dramatic speech about his own personal desires and happiness in an instinctive form of protection when those are both threatened by his being returned to the custody of his parents in his native home country) but he has little to no interest at all in the mannered niceties of polite society.<ref name=GH8/>  His animalistic mind seems possessed of a natural protection against telepathic probing or assault.<ref name=GH6/>
