'''Jeffrey Solomon''' "'''Jeff'''" '''Mace''', also known as the '''Patriot''' and '''[[List of incarnations of Captain America|Captain America]]''', is a fictional character, a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created during the 1940s, a period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. As the [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]], he [[first appeared]] in ''[[Human Torch (android)|The Human Torch]]'' #4 (Spring 1941; mis-numbered #3 on cover), published by Marvel's 1940s precursor, [[Timely Comics]].

In 1976, Marvel revealed via [[retroactive continuity]] that Mace had become [[List of incarnations of Captain America|the third Captain America]] some time after his World War II era adventures. He is also the uncle-by-marriage of [[Thunderbolt Ross]].

The character has been adapted into the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] on ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' played by [[Jason O'Mara]].

==Publication history==
The superhero the Patriot debuted in ''[[Human Torch (android)|The Human Torch]]'' #4 ([[cover-date]]d Spring 1941; mis-numbered #3 on cover),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=1363 ''The Human Torch'' #4] at the [[Grand Comics Database]], with cover blowup [http://www.comics.org/coverview.lasso?id=1363&zoom=4 here]</ref> with both a two-page text story by writer [[Ray Gill]], with a spot illustration by artist [[Bill Everett]], and a 10-page comics story by writer Gill and artist [[George Mandel]]. The character went on to appear in the first of two ''Human Torch'' issues both inadvertently numbered #5, and known to collectors as #5<nowiki>[a]</nowiki> (Summer 1941),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=1519 ''The Human Torch'' #5<nowiki>[a]</nowiki>] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> in a story by Gill and artist [[Sid Greene]]. Concurrently, the Patriot began as regular feature in the superhero anthology ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'', appearing in issues #21–44 (July 1941 – June 1943) and #49 -74 (Nov. 1943 – July 1946), making him one of Timely's most popular characters in the second tier beneath stars [[Captain America]], the Human Torch, and the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]. The Patriot story "Death Stalks the Shipyard", from ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #29, was reprinted during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #16 (Sept. 1968).

A [[simulacrum]] of the Patriot was temporarily created from the mind of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], along with those of the [[Blazing Skull]], the [[Fin (comics)|Fin]], and the Golden Age [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]] and [[Vision (Timely Comics)|Vision]], to aid the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] during the [[Kree-Skrull War]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/24943/ ''The Avengers'' #97 (March 1972)] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

The Patriot first appeared in modern times in a four-part [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] story running through ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #5–6 (March & May 1976) and ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #29–30 (April & June 1976), set during [[World War II]] which [[retcon]]ned him as a member of a newly created superhero team, the [[Liberty Legion]]. That team later appeared alongside [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Ben Grimm|Thing]] in a two-part [[time travel]] story, set during World War II, in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #20 (Oct. 1976) and ''Marvel Two-in-One Annual'' (1976).

When Marvel Comics had revived the character Captain America in 1964, the story explained that he had been [[missing in action]] and in [[suspended animation]] since 1945. This discrepancy with his postwar comic-book appearances was later explained as the result of replacement heroes taking on the mantle. As the third Captain America, Jeffrey Mace would have been behind the mask in ''Captain America Comics'' #59–75 (Nov. 1946 – Feb. 1950) and other comics during that period. Mace succeeded the second Captain America, [[William Naslund]] (formerly the [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|Spirit of '76]]), who was shown in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]?'' vol. 1, #4 (Aug. 1977) as having been killed in 1946.

Mace appeared briefly in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #215 (Nov. 1977), then as a guest-star in ''Captain America Annual'' #6 (1982) with his death depicted in #285 (Sept. 1983). In a flashback, the Patriot co-starred in a World War II adventure with Captain America in ''Captain America Annual'' #13 (1994) and in a post-war adventure with the All Winners Squad in ''All Winners Squad 70th Anniversary Special'' (2009).

A retelling of Jeffrey Mace's origin and time as Captain America is told in the 2010 mini-series ''Captain America: Patriot''. This was collected with the ''All Winners Squad 70th Anniversary Special'' and ''What If?'' #4 in 2011. ''What If?'' #4 was also collected that same year in a ''Captain America Legacy'' volume collecting the debuts of the Captain America replacements.
