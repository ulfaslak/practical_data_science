'''Barnell Bohusk''', currently known as '''Blackwing''', formerly known as '''Beak''', is a [[fictional character]], a superhero appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as being associated with the ''[[X-Men]]'' and its spinoff the ''[[Exiles (comic book)|Exiles]]''. Beak first appeared in ''[[X-Men: Legacy|New X-Men]]'' #117 and was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Ethan Van Sciver]].

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Newxmen125.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Beak's original appearance]]
Born in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]], Beak started developing his powers at [[puberty]]. His body changed into that of a humanoid-bird form, with a beaked face, bulbous eyes, wing-like arms that give him the ability to fly (albeit clumsily), [[Talon (anatomy)|talons]] on his hands and feet, and [[double-jointed]] knees. He also possesses heightened agility, and he may possess heightened senses and a lighter [[skeleton|skeletal structure]] like the avian X-Man formerly known as the [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]]. Feeling disgusted and ashamed because of his appearance, Beak ran away from home and went into hiding. He tells [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]<ref>off-panel in ''New X-Men'' vol. 1 #117</ref> that his [[nickname]] originated from other teenagers in Rotterdam, who would find him hiding behind beer barrels.

===Xavier Institute For Higher Learning===
{{main|New X-Men}}
After the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute For Higher Learning]] publicly revealed that the school was a training ground and [[sanctuary]] for [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], Beak traveled to the [[United States]] and enrolled there. There, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] helped him with his powers. Tragically, the fledgling relationship between Beast and Beak never got a chance to fully develop because of the evil tamperings of [[Cassandra Nova]]. While in the body of [[Professor X]], Cassandra Nova took control over the Beak's mind, leaving him just enough sentient thought to realize what he was doing but not have any control over his actions. She then ordered him to beat Beast almost to death with his prize [[titanium]] [[baseball bat]], which he intended to give as a gift to Beast as a token of gratitude. At the institute Beak fell in love with another classmate, [[Angel Salvadore]] (not to be confused with [[Angel (comics)|Angel]]). Though Angel originally started the relationship on a bet, she later fell in love with him too. They slept together, and Angel became pregnant. Fearing that the X-Men would kick them out, and what their babies would be like (due to their drastically different mutant physiologies; Angel's mutation is [[house fly]]-related) they didn't know what to do. Luckily, the X-Men weren't angry with them and the babies turned out fine. Angel had taken over Wolverine's old shack and laid six eggs which hatched healthy babies with wings. Angel and Beak were given a small house next to the mansion to raise their family. Beak was put into the 'Special Class', taught by the new X-Man [[Xorn]]. At one point Xorn leads his class in an overnight camping trip. An attack by the [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]] happen, who wish to take mutant organs. Separated from their teacher, the students look to Beak for leadership, a role he reluctantly accepts.<ref>Grant Morrison (w), Frank Quitely (p), New X-Men vol. 1 #135-136 (February–March 2003)</ref>

Once again, Beak's trust in those around him would be shaken when Xorn reveals himself to be [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] (originally intended to be Magneto and later [[retcon]]ned by Marvel. It has been subsequently written into the storylines that this may have been caused by the effective Xorn). He had Beak join his [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] along with the rest of the Special Class. The children also came with him. Beak had looked up to Xorn and was happy at first, but when the "Xorneto" started marching humans into [[crematorium]]s, Beak rebelled and nearly lost his life as a result. Xorneto launched him high into the air in a car. Beak leaped out, tried to fly and plunged into the street below, barely surviving. He later joined a resistance group of X-Students led by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]. Among the members of the group were the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] and Dust. The Cuckoos scan Beak's mind, learning he had been influenced by one of the telepaths under Magneto's control and had not been fully responsible for his actions in the takeover of New York. Later, he was the first to strike in the X-Men's last-ditch assault on the Brotherhood. He was able to enter because no one had thought to take his key before trying to kill him. He attacked Magneto with the Titanium baseball bat and was taken out of action early on. His seemingly pointless and 'laughable' stand was a distraction for the attack launched by Fantomex.

===Exiles===
After helping Cyclops depose Magneto, Beak became "unhinged" from time and was forced to join the reality hopping group known as the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]. This has caused him to be separated from Angel, who now thinks he left her. The person who gives the Exiles their missions, the [[Timebroker]], says Beak is destined in the future to save the lives of everyone he knows. Beak saved the lives of everyone in the Marvel multiverse by coming up with the strategy to beat the seemingly invincible evil version of [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]]. He was then sent home, but returned during the [[House of M]] and was present when the second change wave hit.<ref>''House of M'' #7</ref> As a result of the effects of the [[House of M]] event, Beak, his wife Angel and their children (except for Tito, which is also the name of Beak's future grandson) have lost their powers and thus their "hideous" appearance, and are now finally able to live happily.

===New Warriors===
[[Image:Barnellbohusk.jpg|Beak in his depowered form. Art by [[Ramon Bachs]].|right|thumb|150px]]Barnell (under the alias Barry) has been, for months, visiting a restaurant where [[Wind Dancer|Sofia Mantega]] works, under the pretense that he was attracted to her and wished to take her on a date. This was revealed to be a test, in regards to both Sofia's determination and trust toward the recently active, and anti-registration, [[New Warriors]]. Barnell reveals on their "date" that he had been working for these New Warriors, and that he had no attraction to her other than the friendship they had maintained back when she knew him as Beak. After revealing who he is and who he is working for, he then leads her to the New Warrior's Headquarters, where his boss is revealed to be someone dressed as [[Night Thrasher]].<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #1</ref> Barnell has joined the New Warriors under the guise of Blackwing. Blackwing is shown to have the power of flight and energy blasts, which are derived from a power suit.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #3</ref> Angel is also a member of the group under the name Tempest. Both stay with the team until it disbands.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #20</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Currently, Beak wears an advanced body suit that gives him the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and energy blasts, as well as giving him enhanced protection. 

Beak's abilities had probably not fully developed when he lost his mutant powers. However, it is known that he had hollow bones, enhanced agility, and that his entire body was covered in feathers. He had demonstrated a limited ability to glide, but had not mastered controlled flight. His durability appeared to be enhanced as he had fallen several stories without sustaining significant injury. He also had the ability to use his beak as a weapon and peck his opponents.

==Other versions==
==="Here Comes Tomorrow"===
Beak's grandson, '''Tito Bohusk Jr''', the child of his son [[Tito Bohusk]], was shown as a member of the X-Men in the "[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]" future timeline. He was shown to carry his grandfather's titanium bat, and to have fully developed his grandfather's mutation, possessing an actual beak, claws, and feathers that cover all of his body—as well as flight-capable wings that folded along his arms. He saw his grandfather as an inspiration, and upon dying said he believed that the original Beak would be laughing down at him. As a comfort, Wolverine stated that he stood three feet taller than his grandfather.

Created at the end of [[Grant Morrison]]'s run on the ''[[New X-Men]]'' line, Tito was a mutant with an eagle-like head, fully feathered chest and wings and carrying his grandfather's titanium bat.  Tito was shown as a member of the X-Men in the "Here Comes Tomorrow" future timeline. He died in [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine's]] arms during a battle with the Beast (who was taken over by [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|Sublime]]), stating he would never be a great hero like his grandfather. His father Tito Sr. is the only member of the Bohusk clan to retain his mutant X-gene following [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], leaving the possibility for a mutant Tito Jr. to be born eventually. Tito Sr. is the son of the ex-[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] Beak (Barnell Bohusk) and [[Angel Salvadore]] who met at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] when both still had their powers. He has five siblings, only two of whom have names that are known to the reader (Kara and Axel), and all of whom, except Tito, lost their mutant powers to the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] along with their parents.

===''Marvel Zombies 3''===
A zombified version of Beak appears in issue 2 of ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'', assaulting, [[Machine Man]] and [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] as soon as they arrive on Earth-2149 along with other infected wing-laden characters: [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]].<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #2 (2008)</ref>
