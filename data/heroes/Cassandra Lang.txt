==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
Created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], Cassie Lang first appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #47 (April 1979). She first appeared as Stature in ''[[Young Avengers]]'' #6 (May 2006), and adopted the identity of Stinger in ''The Astonishing Ant-Man'' #6 (May 2016).

==Fictional character biography==

===Ant-Man's daughter===
Cassie Lang is introduced to the Marvel Universe as the ill daughter of [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]]. Her congenital heart condition forces her father to steal [[Hank Pym]]'s Ant-Man equipment and Pym Particles, which he uses to rescue Doctor Sondheim, the only doctor able to cure Cassie's condition, from [[Cross Technological Enterprises]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #47</ref>

After the divorce of her parents, Cassie lives for most of her childhood with her father, whom she loves and admires greatly. Although Scott tries his best to keep his superhero life secret, Cassie gradually finds out that he is Ant-Man, and secretly experiments with his Pym Particle supplies on her own.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #3 (2005)</ref> She is fascinated by her father's life as a superhero, and generally has a good relationship with her father's colleagues; when she was younger, she even called Tony Stark "Uncle Tony". However, her mother and stepfather fear that his life with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] is unsafe for a child, and they claim custody over Cassie.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Scott's time as an engineer for the [[Fantastic Four]] brings Cassie to the team's then-headquarters of [[Four Freedoms Plaza]]. In the spectacular environment Cassie calls home, she forges a strong friendship with the former ward of [[Doctor Doom]], [[Kristoff Vernard]]. During the time they share a home with the Fantastic Four, Cassie helps Kristoff adjust to life outside of Doom's castle, and she develops a [[puppy love|crush]] on him.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} It is also during this time that she meets her father in his Ant-Man identity, and confesses that she had known about it for a long time.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol.1 #405 (October 1995)</ref>

After the Fantastic Four go missing and Cassie's father finds himself without a job, Scott takes employment at Oracle, Inc. with the [[Heroes for Hire]] (H4H).{{issue|date=March 2013}} While working with the Heroes for Hire, Cassie has further adventures, accidentally activating the [[Super-Adaptoid]] and receiving horrifying visions of things to come.{{issue|date=March 2013}} The H4H easily defeated Super-Adaptoid, and Cassie's participation in these dark events help her father and his allies defeat [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]] in a battle for the fate of the Earth.{{issue|date=March 2013}} All of these adventures give Cassie a taste for the action-filled life of a superhero, but it causes her mother to take sole custody from Scott.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

As a result of Cassie being kept away from her father Scott, she grows more and more bitter toward her mother, and even more so toward her stepfather Blake Burdick. As a police officer, he cannot stand the world of superheroes the young girl loves, and he unsuccessfully tries to keep Cassie and Scott apart. For years, Cassie visits her father whenever possible, much to her mother and stepfather's chagrin, until the events of "[[Avengers Disassembled]]", when Scott is killed due to the actions of an insane [[Scarlet Witch]].<ref>''Avengers'' #500</ref>

Cassie retreats into herself, blaming Blake for being unable to understand her as her father always did. Blake tries unsuccessfully to be a caring stepfather, despite being sometimes distant toward her, seeing his stepdaughter as a "less than brilliant" girl. Some time after her father's death, and after another confrontation with her mother and stepfather, Cassie decides to run away to Los Angeles to join the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], but after seeing the "Young Avengers" on television just before leaving, she subsequently changes her plans, as she later tells [[Jessica Jones]].<ref>''Young Avengers'' #2-3 (May–June 2005)</ref>

===Young Avengers===
[[File:Stature.png|thumb|left|Cassandra Lang in her first costume from ''[[Young Avengers]] Special'' #1 (December 2005). Art by [[Neal Adams]].]]
[[Iron Lad]], a younger version of classic Avengers foe [[Kang the Conqueror]], desperate for help against his future self after learning what he will become, uses the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]'s database to track and recruit young superpowered individuals connected to the Avengers' history; however, Cassie Lang is not one of the individuals on the list. Wishing to join the Young Avengers, she and [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]] meet the young heroes at the Avengers Mansion; when they refuse to let them join or to let her take her father's gear, she angrily rebukes them, only to discover much to her own shock that by doing so she had increased her size. She later confesses that she had repeatedly stolen [[Hank Pym|Pym particles]] from her father for years, but until then it seemed they never had any effect on her. Cassie later displays the ability to also shrink.<ref>''Young Avengers'' Vol. 1 # 2-5</ref>

Iron Lad assures her that if Vision had known she had developed powers, she would have been part of his plans for the Young Avengers, thus accepting her as a teammate; she then takes part in the battle against Kang, which ends in the villain's defeat. However, as the altered timeline causes several of them to disappear, Iron Lad realizes that he must return to his own time and accept the fact that he will become Kang, much to Cassie's sorrow, as she had fallen in love with him.<ref>''Young Avengers'' Vol. 1 # 5-6</ref>

While [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Man]] order the team to disband, both Cassie and Kate refuse and convince the others to keep the team active; after initially considering '''Ant-Girl''' or '''Giant-Girl''', she ultimately adopts the codename Stature, along with a new costume based on her father's. Despite this, she feels guilty when overhearing her mother and stepfather discussing the possibility of her being a member of the team, also showing that rage or guilt make her respectively grow or shrink, metaphorically reflecting her being a ''[[wiktionary:shrinking violet|shrinking violet]]'' about her family issues.<ref>''Young Avengers'' Vol. 1 # 6-7</ref> After deciding to continue her life as a superhero, Cassie overhears her stepfather talking to her mother. They suspect that she is secretly Stature, but refuse to believe it. Later, Jessica Jones talks to Cassie's mother and confirms Cassie's dual identity. Cassie's mother is overwhelmed by this news and begs Jessica not to tell her husband about this due to his hatred of superheroes; she also worries that although Cassie was cured of her heart condition, her heart might not be able to handle the strain of continuous size-changing.<ref>''Young Avengers'' Vol. 1 # 7</ref>

When Jessica Jones asks Cassie if there isn't even a small part of her wishing for a normal life, Cassie replies, "Ms. Jones, my dad was Ant-Man. I never had a normal life." <ref>''Young Avengers Special'' #1</ref>

In the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' limited series, Cassie, along with her fellow Young Avengers, join Captain America's resistance to the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhero Registration Act]]; she and the rest of her team stay at a [[wiktionary:safe house|safe house]], while [[Nick Fury]] arranges new secret identities for them. During this time, she participates in a rescue effort, which turns out to be a trap laid by Iron Man: during the subsequent battle, [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]] is killed by a [[Ragnarok (comics)|clone]] of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and her teammate [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] is captured. Afterwards, Cassie opts to leave Captain America's side and to register, citing her reasons as wishing to fight villains rather than cops and other heroes.<ref>''Civil War'' #4</ref>

===The Initiative===
Cassie Lang joins the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]], as a trainee. Along with fellow Initiative members [[Dusk (comics)#Cassie St. Commons|Dusk]], [[Tigra]], [[Silverclaw]], and [[Anya Corazon|Araña]], she is ensnared by the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]].<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol 2 #18</ref> Although she (along with the others) is mentally controlled into fighting [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], she is eventually freed from the mind control.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #20</ref>

Her time at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]] brings her in to contact with her father's successor as Ant-Man: [[Eric O'Grady]]. O'Grady makes several disparaging remarks about her father, not realizing that she is within earshot; this causes a literally giant-sized brawl between the two as both grow to their giant forms. After O'Grady picks up a bus and hits Lang with it, [[Henry Pym]] intervenes. [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] breaks up the fight by attacking their now giant-sized [[Achilles tendon]]s, bringing all three crashing to the ground.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #8</ref>

Later, the [[Vision (Jonas)|Vision]] visits Cassie, disguising himself as Tony Stark in order to take her out on a date. After fighting off an attempt by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] to steal the Vision, he confesses that because he was programmed based on Iron Lad's mental patterns, he shares Iron Lad's attraction to her, and hopes that she can love him; Cassie is unsure, but does not reject him, telling him to give her time to sort things out.<ref>''Young Avengers Presents'' #4</ref>

Cassie accidentally injures her stepfather Blake while stopping the [[Growing Man]]. Her guilt causes her to continue shrinking down, and the other Young Avengers attempt to snap her out of it before she shrinks into non-existence. With the help of [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]], she comes to terms with the responsibilities and risks of her position as part of the Young Avengers and the Initiative, reasoning that Blake also faces the risks as a policeman.<ref>''Young Avengers Presents'' #5</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
Stature fights against the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] of Manhattan as part of the Initiative.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #3</ref> She grows larger than the Skrull Yellowjacket and punches him out.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7</ref>

===Dark Reign===
In the aftermath of the Skrull invasion, Cassie Lang leaves the Initiative at the start of the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline and rejoins the Young Avengers. Cassie and Vision (now seemingly in a relationship) fly to the Avengers Mansion ruins, having been summoned by Wiccan with warnings of a great magical threat. After finding their teammates turned to stone, they encounter the Scarlet Witch transporting them away to be a part of the [[Mighty Avengers]], led by Hank Pym.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 1 #21 (March 2009)</ref> Despite her evident and vocal distrust of Scarlet Witch, whom she holds responsible for her father's death, she remains on the team. During a confrontation with the Fantastic Four for a device of the late Bill Foster, she refuses to participate in the attack and instead warns them about what was really happening, citing her reluctance to fight those she feels are like family to her.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #25-26 (July, August 2009)</ref> Eventually, Cassie's distrust of Scarlet Witch leads her to expose her as [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] in disguise.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #27-30 (Dec. 2009)</ref> While part of the team, Lang also fights a demi-god at [[Mount Wundagore]]<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 1 #23 (May 2009)</ref> and a homicidal ancient [[Inhumans|Inhuman]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 1 #28 (October 2009)</ref>

[[Norman Osborn]] later mounts a [[Siege (comics)|full-scale attack]] on [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]]. Teaming up with the rest of the Mighty Avengers one last time, Cassie and Vision help stop the Thunderbolts from delivering Odin's Spear (an Asgardian weapon of virtually limitless power) to the Iron Patriot; in the battle, she also fights the new Ant-Man again.<ref>''Siege'' #1-4 (January 2010 - May 2010)</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 1 #141-143</ref>

===Heroic Age===
At some point, Cassie applies for a babysitter job with [[Jessica Jones]] and [[Luke Cage]], though more in the hope of eventually finding her way into the ranks of the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] rather than any dedication to babysitting itself; she is dismissed in favor of [[Squirrel Girl]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #7</ref>

===The Children's Crusade and death===
When Wiccan's uncontrolled magical energy nearly kills several members of the [[Sons of the Serpent]], the Avengers begin to fear that he might become another Scarlet Witch; they explain to the Young Avengers how the Scarlet Witch went insane after the loss of her twin boys, resulting in the death of the original Vision and Scott Lang, and rendering nearly all of the world's mutants powerless. When Wiccan feels unsure about what to do, Cassie suggests that they try to find the Scarlet Witch, believing that if they can show her that her children are alive, she may be able to reverse everything she has done, including her father's death.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = [[Allan Heinberg]]| penciller = [[Jim Cheung]]| inker = [[Mark Morales (artist)|Mark Morales]]| story = Avengers: The Children's Crusade| title = Avengers: The Children's Crusade| volume = 1| issue = 1| date = July 2010| publisher = Marvel Comics| location =New York City}}</ref>

During the team's search in Latveria, Cassie is reunited with Iron Lad, and, when he takes the team back to the period of [[Avengers Disassembled]], she is able to bring her father forward in time to the present, avoiding his original death from the attack by [[Jack of Hearts (comics)|Jack of Hearts]]. After she manifests her powers in front of him, Scott tells her he's proud of her.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer =Allan Heinberg| penciller = Jim Cheung| inker = Mark Morales| story = Avengers: The Children's Crusade| title = Avengers: The Children's Crusade| volume = 1| issue = 6| date = August 2011| publisher = Marvel Comics| location =New York City}}</ref>

After the Scarlet Witch is found, Dr. Doom steals her reality warping powers and fights the combined forces of the Avengers and X-Men. As Doom seemingly kills her father (who actually managed to shrink down and escape with minor wounds), a distraught Cassie charges the super-powered dictator, gaining time for Scarlet Witch and Wiccan to prepare a joint spell to remove his new powers; however, Doom retaliates by blasting Cassie with an explosive spell, killing her.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer =Allan Heinberg| penciller = Jim Cheung| inker = Mark Morales| story = Avengers: The Children's Crusade| title = Avengers: The Children's Crusade| volume = 1| issue = 8| date = 2011| publisher = Marvel Comics| location =New York City}}</ref> Although Iron Lad offers to take her into the future to save her, his offer is rejected by the other Young Avengers, as it is more in line with what Kang would do than what an Avenger should do. While contemplating rebuilding the Vision (who Iron Lad destroyed in rage when he protested against his plans to save Cassie), the Young Avengers realize that they would have to tell a restored Vision about Cassie's death, and thus decide not to follow through with the rebuilding. Kate expresses her desire to believe that Vision and Cassie are somehow together in the afterlife. The team disbands and a statue of Cassie and the Vision's is built in their honor in the gardens of the mansion.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer =Allan Heinberg| penciller = Jim Cheung| inker = Mark Morales| story = Avengers: The Children's Crusade| title = Avengers: The Children's Crusade| volume = 1| issue = 9| date = 2011| publisher = Marvel Comics| location =New York City}}</ref>

===Resurrection===
[[File:Cassie Lang resurrected.png|100px|thumb|left|A resurrected Cassie Lang from ''Avengers World'' #16 (December 2014). Art by Ramon Rosanas.]]
Bentley 23 (a clone of [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]) of the [[Future Foundation]] later postulates that, due to the unstable nature of Pym Particles, Cassie's body could conceivably regenerate into an ionic form similar to the resurrection of [[Wonder Man]]; he suggests digging up the corpse to check, stating that he is sure his classmates are thinking the same thing.<ref>''FF'' (vol. 2) #16</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Doctor Doom is transformed into a more heroic, altruistic form as a result of the battle with the [[Red Skull]] that involved a spell that inverted heroes and villains' personalities.{{issue|date=April 2015}} Seeking redemption for his past crimes, but only able to draw on enough power to alter one key event, Doom chooses to use that power to resurrect Cassie. She is then seen tearfully reuniting with her father and his new girlfriend Darla Deering.<ref>''Avengers World'' #16</ref>

In the ''Ant-Man'' ongoing series, she is shown living a normal life as a middle-school student. Worried that Scott's lifestyle and actions might attract more danger to her, Cassie's mother decides to relocate to [[Miami]] despite Cassie's reluctance. Scott nonetheless decides to relocate there as well to stay near his daughter.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> She is later kidnapped by [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] on behalf of Augustine Cross of Cross Technological Enterprises; Cross believes that Cassie's Pym Particle-irradiated heart can sustain [[Darren Cross]]'s sickly body.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #3-4</ref> Scott didn't arrive in time to prevent the transplant of Cassie's heart (which caused the revived Darren Cross to shrink uncontrollably) and so Dr. Sondheim was forced to transplant another one in Cassie's body, with Scott slowing down her immune system enough to make sure it is not rejected. While Cassie survived, not knowing herself what had happened to her, Scott was so shaken up by that experience that he decided to leave her, reasoning that he cannot risk to put her in harm's way again and that she deserves a normal and happy life he cannot provide.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #5</ref>

A now depowered Cassie struggles with her everyday activities, while feeling frustrated by her current status; feeling resentful over Scott's seeming disappearance, she is later shocked and outraged to find out that he was secretly following her around, watching over her. One day, she is reunited with Kate, who has found out about her resurrection; despite her lack of powers, she follows her friend to a [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] hideout, but almost gets killed, which further fuels her frustration, despite Kate's assurances that she is still special her own way. However, Cassie ultimately decides to turn to the new [[Power Broker]] to regain her powers; although he realizes that she has no intention of actually becoming a supervillain, he tells her about Darren Cross having stolen her heart and that her father hid it from her. Power Broker offers a deal, in which he will grant her wish if she infiltrates Cross' base to shut him down; Cassie accepts, and adopts the new codename '''Stinger'''.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #1-6</ref> When Scott learns about her disappearance, he rushes to help her, but ends up captured in her place; however, Cassie manages to get his crew to help him escape. In the end, though, because of Darla's show, they end up discovered by the police; to protect his daughter, Scott takes the blame and claims he kidnapped and forced her to help him. Cassie captures Power Broker shortly after her father's arrest.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #7-11</ref> When Cassie finally confesses to her mother what she did, Peggy takes her to the trial, where Darren Cross in the Yellowjacket suit and his henchmen ([[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] and [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]]) burst into the courtroom to get revenge on Scott. Cassie rushes to help her father, and the two make amends during the fight, which ends with Cassie defeating Cross. Cassie's mother is called as the final prosecution witness, but surprisingly she declares that Scott was innocent, as he always looked after Cassie and has always been her hero, admitting that he took the blame for what she did; this allowed Scott to be acquitted. Afterward, Cassie finally receives her mother's blessing as a superhero, and joins her father as a new crimefighting duo.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #13</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:stature-comics.jpg|thumb|150px|Lang alongside her gigantic alter ego Stature. From issue #6 of ''The Astonishing Ant-Man''. Art by Mark Brooks]]
Cassie Lang has the ability to increase and decrease her size. She can become roughly {{convert|40|ft|m}} tall and can shrink to the size of an ant. Her abilities seemed to be fueled by her emotions. She grows when she gets angry and shrinks when she feels guilty. Cassie seems to have become more powerful since first demonstrating her powers, as she has in recent issues surpassed her previous growth limit. At first she struggled to shrink to 6&nbsp;inches and grow to 10–15 feet.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #2-6</ref> She has been seen growing larger than the Skrull Yellowjacket, who could grow to at least {{convert|100|ft|m}} tall.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7</ref>  It was established that she and Hank Pym share an upper limit of somewhere around {{convert|250|ft|m}} in height, and that, if she keeps her bigger dimensions for too long, Cassie will suffer from strains that will eventually force her to shrink back down.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #24-31</ref>

As Stinger, she has a helmet similar to that of Ant-Man, which allows her to communicate with and control "over five thousands species of ants and insects"; she also sports a suit with bio-synthetic wings that allow her to fly, and that can fire bio-electric blasts from the wrists.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #6-10</ref>

==Other versions==

===MC2===
[[File:StingerAnext.JPG|100px|right|thumb|Cassie Lang as Stinger from ''A-Next'' #1.]]
In [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], Cassandra Lang is now a doctor and operates under the name Stinger on the group [[A-Next]]. Although she is the oldest member of A-Next, in her mid-20s, and the only one on the original team with a professional life and a scientific background, she is still doted on by her father, who constantly worries about her newfound superhero life. She possesses many abilities originally engineered by Henry Pym, including resizing, flying, communication with insects, and firing [[bioelectromagnetism|bioelectric]] "stinger" blasts (as well artificial "stingers" sedative darts), all based on her costume and helmet. She does not seem to be capable of increasing her size and strength, unlike her main continuity version.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Avengers Fairy Tales===
{{Main|Marvel Fairy Tales}}
In issue 3 of ''Avengers Fairy Tales'', Cassie Lang is portrayed as Alice of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''. She encounters Wonderland versions of the Young Avengers.
