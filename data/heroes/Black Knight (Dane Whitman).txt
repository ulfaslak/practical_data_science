'''Dane Whitman''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The third character to bear the '''[[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]]''' name, he was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]], [[John Verpoorten]] and artist [[George Tuska]], and [[first appeared]] in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #47 (December 1967). The [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|original Black Knight]]'s descendent and the [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|supervillain Black Knight]]'s nephew, he inherited a [[Ebony Blade|mystical sword]] that carried a curse and took the Black Knight name to help restore honor, and has been a long time member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' various incarnations as well as the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], [[Ultraforce]], [[Heroes for Hire]], and [[MI-13 (comics)|MI: 13]].

The character was featured in a four-issue mini-series in 1990 and two one-shots in 1996 and 2007. Starting in 2015, he was the main character in Marvel's ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' ongoing ''Black Knight'' series, the first ongoing series to feature Dane Whitman as the titular character; however, this was short-lived as dwindling sales resulted in the series' cancellation after five issues.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Arrant|first1=Chris|title=MARVEL's BLACK KNIGHT Cancelled|url=http://www.newsarama.com/27776-marvel-s-black-knight-cancelled.html|website=Newsarama.com|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref>

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}
Following his introduction, the Dane Whitman Black Knight became a recurring character in the superhero-team comic ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', with his first solo story appearing shortly afterward in the anthology title ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #17 (Nov. 1968). From 1979 to 1980, the Black Knight also appeared in black & white feature in the [[Marvel UK]] comic ''[[Hulk Weekly]]'', where the feature was to be the longest-lasting of the comic's UK-originated material, appearing in the majority of the title's 63 issues. It was written by [[Steve Parkhouse]] with art by [[Paul Neary]] and [[John Stokes (artist)|John Stokes]].<!--cite needed for following, and [[WP:DATED]] issue fixed: the complete story is set to be reprinted in the last two volumes of Panini's original ''Captain Britain'' collections.--> He also appeared in his own Marvel US title, the [[miniseries]] ''Black Knight'' #1–4 (June–Sept. 1990) by husband-and-wife writers [[Roy Thomas|Roy]] and [[Dann Thomas]] and successive [[penciller]]s [[Tony DeZuniga]] and [[Rich Buckler]]. This was followed by the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Black Knight: Exodus'' #1 (Dec. 1996), by writer [[Ben Raab]] and penciller [[Jimmy Cheung]].

In July 2015, it was announced that [[Frank Tieri (writer)|Frank Tieri]] and [[Luca Pizzari]] would be launching a new ''Black Knight'' series as part of Marvel's post-''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' relaunch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/tieri-pizzari-bring-black-knight-to-all-new-all-different-marvel|title=Tieri &amp; Pizzari Bring "Black Knight" to All-New All-Different Marvel|date=July 31, 2015|website=Comicbookresources.com|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}</ref> This series will feature Whitman as the ruler of New Avalon, a kingdom he has claimed in the reality known as [[Weirdworld]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/25407-black-knight-returns-in-all-new-all-different-marvel-series.html|title=BLACK KNIGHT Returns In ALL-NEW ALL-DIFFERENT MARVEL Series|website=Newsarama.com|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}</ref> The ongoing series was cancelled with issue number 5 in 2016, as Marvel was unhappy with its sales. The writer of the series, Frank Tieri, now considers it a standalone limited series and expressed his feelings over the series being cut short. ''Black Knight'' is notable as the first "All-New, All-Different" comic series to be cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/27776-marvel-s-black-knight-cancelled.html|title=MARVEL's BLACK KNIGHT Cancelled|website=Newsarama.com|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2007}}

===Early life===
Dane Whitman was born in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]] and is best known as the modern-day Black Knight, continuing a legacy that began in medieval England. The first [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Black Knight]], Whitman's ancestor Sir Percy of Scandia, lived during the reign of King Arthur.  Percy's murder at the hand of his nemesis [[Mordred (comics)|Modred]] began a string of successors, all of them Percy's descendants.

It was revived by Whitman's uncle Nathan Garrett, who became the [[supervillain]] [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Black Knight II]]. After being mortally wounded during a battle with [[Iron Man]], he escaped to his estate, summoned his nephew to confess his crimes, and asked him to restore honor to their family legacy and atone for Garrett's misdeeds.<ref>''The Avengers'' #47</ref>

===The Avengers===
Whitman became the Black Knight, using [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]] for his mount. During his first outing, he was mistaken for his uncle and attacked by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], though they eventually realized their mistake.<ref>''The Avengers'' #48</ref> Later, he infiltrated the [[Masters of Evil]], proving his worth to the Avengers, who offered him provisional membership.<ref>''The Avengers'' #54</ref> Shortly afterward, he inherited Castle Garrett and traveled to England. He encountered the spirit of Sir Percy of Scandia there and was given the [[Ebony Blade]].<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes'' #17</ref> He then encountered [[Doctor Strange]], and helped fight the extra-dimensional threat [[Tiboro]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #178</ref>

[[Image:MarvelSuper-Heroes17.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #17 (Nov. 1968). Black Knight figure by [[John Romita Sr.]]; background art by [[Howard Purcell]] (penciller) and [[Dan Adkins]] (inker), from page 14 of story.<ref>Credits per ''The Official Marvel Index to the Avengers'' #3 (Oct. 1987), p. 22</ref>]]
While still a provisional Avenger, he helped defeat [[Kang the Conqueror]], who was given the power of death over the Avengers by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] as a prize for winning a recent game that Whitman had become unwittingly involved in when he assisted Goliath in defeating his chosen opponent (thus rendering that round of the game a draw in the Grandmaster's eyes since the Avengers did not defeat their opponents on their own). Since Whitman was not a full Avenger at the time, Kang had no power over him, and so Whitman was able to defeat him with relative ease. Whitman then officially joined the Avengers in recognition of his aid.<ref>''The Avengers'' #71</ref> Later the Ebony Blade was used by the Olympian war god [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], to put out the Promethean Flame and turn most of the Olympians to crystal. Black Knight travelled to Olympus with other members and helped defeat Ares.<ref>''The Avengers'' #100</ref>

===The Defenders and Captain Britain ===
Whitman was an early member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He also became the team's first casualty after kissing the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], petrifying him.<ref>''The Defenders'' #4 (Feb. 1973)</ref> His spirit was drawn to the 12th century by the sorcerer Amergin the [[Druid]], and he took [[spiritual possession]] of his ancestor, the Crusader Sir Eobar Garrington until Garrington died due to the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]].  Meanwhile, Whitman chose to stay in the 12th century and was cared for by fellow Defender [[Valkyrie (comics)|Valkyrie]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #11</ref> Whitman then battled the Fomor, alongside the time-traveling Avengers. He then employed the Evil Eye to seal the portal between Earth and [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Avalon]]. Whitman returned to the 20th century and his original body was restored. He was accompanied by a gift from Amergin: a black, winged horse called '''[[Valinor (comics)|Valinor]]''', named after the [[Valinor|fictional location of that name]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #225</ref> Some time later Merlyn sent Whitman to locate the lost hero [[Captain Britain]] and, with his aid, travel to the Otherworld dimension to save Camelot.<ref>''Hulk Comic'' #1–63, March 1979 – May 1980</ref> Both heroes were briefly kidnapped by the Grandmaster to participate in the original Contest of Champions.<ref>''Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions'' #1–3, Jun–Aug 1982</ref>

===The Blood Curse===
Whitman learned the Ebony Blade was cursed: every time it drew blood, it drove its user closer to madness. Whitman freed Sir Percy's spirit from the Earthly plane, purging the blood curse from the sword.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #68–69</ref> Whitman resumed active duty with the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers'' #254</ref> helping his teammates Wasp and [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]] experiment with their powers, and battled against the fourth Masters of Evil while they invaded [[Avengers Mansion]].<ref>''Avengers'' #273–277</ref>

When the [[Sub-Mariner]] used the sword to kill his wife [[Marrina (comics)|Marrina]], who had become a monster, the blood curse was revived. The curse began to transform Whitman's body into the same mystic metal as the blade.<ref>''The Avengers'' #293</ref> He was forced to don an exo-skeleton when the curse's creeping paralysis began to affect his mobility. He also showed signs of mental instability.<ref>''The Avengers'' #294</ref> Ultimately, the blood curse became so virulent that it would draw blood from anyone even touching the Black Knight.<ref>''The Avengers'' #295</ref> Sir Percy took possession of Whitman's body to stop the blood curse.<ref>''Black Knight'' vol. 2, #1</ref> The transformation was undone by the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]], Whitman and the ghost of Sir Percy. Sir Percy's spirit merged with the sword, canceling the curse and returning Whitman to normal.<ref>''Black Knight'' vol. 2 #4</ref> Whitman stopped using the Ebony Blade and left the Avengers.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  He later developed a weapon that projected a sword-like sheath of energy (a [[lightsaber]]) as a replacement.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The Ebony Blade would come into the possession of Sean Dolan, who had briefly served as the "[[squire]]" of the Black Knight; it transformed Dolan into the [[Bloodwraith]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #22 (1993)</ref>

===Sersi===
After rejoining the Avengers, Whitman was a major member of the team and eventually became the de facto field leader in [[Captain America]]'s absence. He became romantically involved with his teammate [[Sersi]] (of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]). This relationship soon came under strain as Sersi proved increasingly unstable due to the machinations of a man called [[Proctor (comics)|Proctor]]. In an attempt to stabilize her, fellow Eternal [[Ikaris]] mentally bonded Sersi and Whitman with a process called the "''gann josin''," but this did little to slow the process – not least due to Whitman's resentment at having the bond imposed upon him, especially as he was beginning to turn his attentions toward [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], one of the [[Inhumans]]' royal family. Sersi eventually snapped completely, forcing Whitman to aid her – until the sight of her attacking Crystal enabled him to break the ''gann josin'''s hold on him temporarily. Proctor was later revealed to be an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] counterpart of Whitman. Having been rejected by his own Sersi and twisted by the ''gann josin'' and his Ebony Blade's curse, he now traveled the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]] with the aid of a captured [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] named Ute on a mission to kill the Sersi of every reality. Ultimately, Sersi slew Proctor with his own Ebony Blade and was subsequently forced to leave the Marvel Universe to restore her mind. Whitman left with her, partly because he didn't want to come between Crystal and her husband [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and partly because he felt responsible for what had happened to Sersi.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

The pair were transported to the [[Ultraverse]] (home of the [[Malibu Comics]] characters).  They were separated and Whitman became the leader of the superhero team called [[Ultraforce (comics)|Ultraforce]]. He and Sersi briefly reunited to return to the Marvel universe, but something went wrong along the way. Instead of returning to the Marvel universe's present, they ended up in the 12th century and Whitman once again found his spirit in the body of Sir Eobar Garrington. His consciousness was buried under Garrington's, however, and Sersi was forced to pass Garrington's soul onto the next plane (with his permission) to restore Whitman's consciousness. Whitman found himself embroiled in a conflict with the evil mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] alongside his ancestor's best friend Bennet du Paris, the mutant who would become [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. Apocalypse tried to get du Paris to kill his friend, but du Paris refused.  Judging him weak, Apocalypse put du Paris in a state of suspended animation. Out of respect for his ancestor's friendship with du Paris, Whitman organized an order of knights to guard du Paris' body, which they did through the ages until he was found and revived by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Sersi created another portal, this time to the correct time period, and she and Whitman departed the 12th century.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Whitman and Sersi were somehow separated in transit, which ripped their ''gann josin'' bond apart. Whitman found himself back in New York in the proper time, but without Sersi. He was soon dealt another shattering blow when he learned that the Avengers and most of the other major heroes had apparently perished in their battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] while he was gone. Whitman then learned the [[Lady of the Lake]] had selected him as the Pendragon for his age. She bestowed upon him new mystical equipment from [[Avalon]]: a suit of armor, the enchanted flying horse Strider, the Shield of Night, which absorbed energy, and the Sword of Light, which returned that energy in the form of an energy projectile.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Heroes for Hire===
The newly empowered Knight helped the [[Heroes for Hire]] defeat [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]], then accepted [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'s offer to join the newly formed team (due primarily to his concern over former teammate and friend [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], who had been drinking heavily out of grief for the Avengers' deaths). Whitman eventually learned what happened to Sersi when she reappeared asking for help to defeat yet another of her old enemy [[Ghaur]]'s nefarious schemes. Later, the Heroes for Hire found themselves in the midst of a major conflict in the [[High Evolutionary]]'s city of [[Wundagore]]. The Black Knight left the team to assist the [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Knights of Wundagore]] along with Quicksilver and later returned to the Avengers when they expanded their roster to include satellite teams around the world.  Whitman was sent to the [[Slorenia]]n border, where the Bloodwraith had used the Ebony Blade to absorb the souls of the entire population after they had been killed by the android [[Ultron]]. After the "Kang War" arc, the Avengers disbanded these global teams.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===New Excalibur===
Whitman reappeared in ''[[New Excalibur]]'' in the mid-2000s. He has opened up a museum in England chronicling the Black Knights that have existed throughout history. Whitman recently learned that Sir Percy was not the original Black Knight, but that eight men had held the Ebony Blade prior. The Ebony Blade however corrupted these men, and Sir Percy was deemed the only one noble enough to wield the Blade. Also at this time, Merlin told Whitman that he must not destroy the Blade as he had previously been told to do. It is not clear whether he has access to his Avalonian equipment at present. In ''New Excalibur'', Whitman was invited to join the team but after the second adventure with them he refuses as he believes that his [[Ebony Blade]] is not the real one and needs to find the original.<ref>''New Excalibur'' #10–11</ref>

===MI: 13===
{{main|Captain Britain and MI13}}
Whitman returned to join [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]] as part of the [[Secret Invasion]] crossover.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12843 Super Spy Weekend: Black Knight], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 10, 2008</ref> He was armed by what he believed was the Ebony Blade, which strongly encouraged him to kill, but was later revealed to be a fake<ref>''Captain Britain and MI:13'' #7</ref> created by Dracula;<ref>''Captain Britain and MI:13'' #9</ref> this fake possessed an intelligence and fed on blood. Dane also was revealed to have a literal stone heart, given to him by Sersi to keep him "above it all" and uninvolved.<ref name="Captain Britain and MI:13 #10">''Captain Britain and MI:13'' #10</ref>

Dane battled the Skrull forces in London, showing a new informal and wisecracking personality (a deliberate defence against the "Ebony Blade's" suggestions), and quickly bonded with medic [[Faiza Hussain]], with whom he appears to have romantic tensions. Following the Skrull war, he made her his [[squire]].<ref>''Captain Britain and MI:13'' #5</ref>

After discovering he did not have the real Ebony Blade, he went to [[Wakanda]] and was given the real Blade back. He still retains the fake, vampiric sword.<ref name="Captain Britain and MI:13 #10"/>

===Original Sin===
During the events of ''[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]'', a historian named [[Rebecca Stevens (comics)|Rebecca Stevens]] learned that Whitman had violently attacked and nearly killed a new version of [[Savage Steel]] due to the influence of the Ebony Blade. Rebecca pleaded with him to turn over the sword to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] or the Avengers, reasoning that its bloodlust was driving him mad, but Whitman refused. Despite his assurance that he was fine, his home was seen covered in slash marks, with Whitman himself curled up on the floor in a mentally unhinged state. He is also seen threatening to slay Rebecca with the Blade but she remained unaware of the danger.<ref>''Original Sins'' #2 (2014)</ref>

Around this same time, Dane returned to action as the leader of Euroforce, a team of European superheroes.<ref>''Avengers World'' #8</ref> Though he claimed to not be bitter about being excluded from Captain America's new team of Avengers, it was implied that Dane's deteriorating mental state had been the very reason he was passed over for membership.<ref>''Avengers World'' #10 (2014)</ref>

===Journey to Weirdworld===
As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Black Knight arrived on [[Weirdworld]] after killing [[Exemplars (comics)#Carnivore|Carnivore]] while losing control to the Ebony Blade, which caused him to flee from the scene of Carnivore's death. Upon arriving on Weirdworld, he killed King Zaltin Tar to establish New Avalon and built an army with the help of two warriors named Shield and Spear.<ref>''Black Knight'' Vol. 4 #1</ref> Black Knight has the army built in anticipation of the arrival of the [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Division]], who are seeking to bring him to justice.<ref>''Black Knight'' Vol. 4 #2</ref> After struggling to maintain his sanity, Dane Whitman is forced to battle the Uncanny Avengers, led by the aged Steve Rogers, who wish to arrest him for killing a criminal when he was still part of the Avengers team.<ref>''Black Knight'' Vol. 4 #3</ref> It is revealed that Whitman accidentally entered Weirdworld, along with a Hydra submarine, from 1945. The members of Hydra on board the submarine became the group known as the Fangs of the Serpent to the inhabitants of Weirdworld.<ref name="Black Knight Vol. 4 #5">''Black Knight'' Vol. 4 #5</ref> As the Uncanny Avengers arrive to arrest Whitman, he unites the armies of the land to fight against them. Eventually, he is defeated and a truce is made: Rogers will take the Ebony Blade back to Earth and Whitman will be free to rule New Avalon. However, Rogers is possessed by the blade and attacks his teammates.<ref>''Black Knight'' Vol. 4 #4</ref> Meanwhile, the son of the king Whitman overthrew to become the new lord gathers the Fangs of the Serpent to attack Whitman. After their defeat, Rogers and Doctor Voodoo agree that the only person who can bear the toll of the Ebony Blade is Whitman, and the Blade also shows this by not allowing any harm to come to Whitman. As the Avengers leave, leaving behind an expert on the Black Knight who came with them to look after Whitman, it is concluded that Whitman had been maintaining his sanity better than everyone had thought. Whitman concludes that for now ruling New Avalon is good, and the story ends on a light tone, Whitman not being persecuted as he has suffered enough under the Blade's spell.<ref name="Black Knight Vol. 4 #5"/>

==Powers and abilities==
The Black Knight was originally a normal athletic human being with no superhuman powers. While sharing the ''gann josin'' with [[Sersi]], his strength, speed, and other physical abilities were mildly enhanced. After the ''gann josin'' link was broken, Whitman returned to being a normal human being. As part of his new role as the Pendragon, however, Whitman has gained minor mystical abilities, such as the ability to see through mystical illusions by looking "past the mundane."

Whitman is an excellent swordsman whose skills have allowed him to best [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] in combat. He is also an excellent fighter in general, able to hold his own against such skilled fighters as [[Captain America]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. He is also an expert horseman. Additionally, Whitman started out as a scientist, though specializing in physics (having earned a master's degree in physics), he is proficient in a wide array of advanced sciences and technologies, including genetic and mechanical engineering, and continues to approach things from a scientific perspective more often than not, despite his ties to the world of magic. He has also demonstrated good leadership skills as leader of both the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Ultraforce (comics)|Ultraforce]]. He has strong strategic and tactical skills.

==Weapons and equipment==
Whitman has gone through several different sets of equipment since his creation.

===Scientific equipment===
Whitman first became the Black Knight to atone for the crimes his uncle [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]] had committed using the name. He started out with his uncle's non-magical tools, namely a power lance that fired energy blasts, a suit of body armor, and [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]], a genetically engineered winged white horse.

===Ebony Blade===
{{Main|Ebony Blade}}

Whitman eventually gained the Ebony Blade, a weapon that had been passed down through the ages from one of his ancestors to another.  Although it was incredibly powerful, it carried a harmful curse that caused Whitman to eventually abandon it. As of ''[[New Excalibur]]'' #10, Whitman gained possession of a faux Ebony Blade.

===Neural Sword===
After giving up the Ebony Blade, Whitman designed and constructed a neural sword.  The neural sword appears to be made of a laser beam and cuts through non-living matter. Its "laser" blade is actually a neural disruptor when used against living beings; when Whitman cuts someone with the sword, it delivers a massive jolt to the being's central nervous system. This jolt is usually enough to incapacitate someone within just a few hits.  Alternately, Whitman can reverse the neural sword's energy stream so that it encases its hilt and by extension, Whitman's fist in a high-energy field. Using the sword in this fashion enables Whitman to punch with some unspecified degree of enhanced strength.  The neural sword also creates a refraction field used to defend against energy-based attacks.

===Avalonian equipment===
In the 1997 ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' series, the Lady of the Lake named Whitman the Pendragon for the current era and gave him an amulet.  When Whitman says the word "Avalon" while wearing the amulet, he gains the following:

:'''Armor:''' The armor Whitman currently wears has been described as mystical. It is said to be supernaturally durable for its light weight, but specific information on the durability of the armor is scarce.

:'''Strider:''' Strider is a mystical creature like Valinor rather than a genetically engineered one like Aragorn, but he is unique in that he possesses mystical powers of his own.  Most notably, Strider is capable of far greater airspeeds than either of Whitman's previous mounts; he is easily capable of breaking the sound barrier. Whitman can verbally summon Strider to appear at his side or return to Avalon as he pleased.  While mounted on Strider, Whitman is magically protected from any harsh environments such as the depths of the ocean.

:'''Shield of Night:''' The Shield of Night is a mystical [[kite shield]]; it not only protects him from most attacks but also absorbs the energy of the forces directed against it. He can then release that stored energy in the form of power blasts from his blade, the Sword of Light. Whitman has used it to block and absorb the energy of everything from [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]]'s explosive blasts to fire to punches.

:'''Sword of Light:''' The Sword of Light is a mystical sword capable of projecting the energy absorbed by the Shield of Night in blasts of the same kind of energy. It is also, supernaturally durable and can cut through almost any substance.

While Whitman still has access to Strider and the mystical armor he has not been seen using the Shield of Night or Sword of Light for some time. He has adopted a photonic shield similar to those used in the past by Captain America and U.S.Agent.

===Miscellaneous===
Whitman has also employed an atomic steed, typically used by the [[High Evolutionary]]'s [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Knights of Wundagore]], in place of a winged horse.

==Other versions==

===Marvel Zombies===
Whitman appears as a zombified version of himself in [[Marvel Zombies]], in the ''[[Marvel Zombies: Dead Days|Dead Days]]'' one-shot. He can be seen battling [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in a battle between the living and dead inhabitants of the [[Marvel Universe]] in New York City.<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'' #1</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' reality, Dane Whitman appears in the pages of ''[[Ultimate Comics: Ultimates]]'' as a member of [[West Coast Avengers|an Ultimates team]] that preceded [[Ultimates|the current one]] by almost a decade. This version of Dane Whitman was a Corporal in the Marine Corps. After saving the lives of his fellow soldiers from an explosive in [[Baghdad]], he received the [[Purple Heart]] badge, the [[Silver Star Medal]] and the [[Medal of Honor]], but was left [[quadriplegic]]. As The Black Knight, he is highly unstable and was kept from officially joining the team until he stabilized. This never came to pass as the team botched the mission and the project was shut down immediately. Later, the project was revived by a corrupt California Governor who sent them to fight the Ultimates.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #23</ref>

===Proctor===
Proctor is a villainous alternate version of the Black Knight. He leads a team called the "Gatherers", whose goal is to kill all versions of [[Sersi]] in retaliation for the one in Proctor's reality rejecting him. His mission brings him to the mainstream reality's Earth, where he tries to win [[Magdalene (comics)|Magdalene's]] love.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer = [[Bob Harras]] |penciller = [[Kirk Jarvinen]] |story = Familial Connections |title = [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] |issue = 348 |date = June 1992 |publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> and infiltrate the Avengers.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer = Bob Harras |penciller = [[Steve Epting]] |story = Alternate Visions |title = The Avengers |issue = 360 |date = March 1993}}</ref> At the end of his confrontation with the Avengers, he is impaled by the [[Ebony Blade]] but manages to escape.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer = Bob Harras |penciller = Steve Epting |story = A Gathering of Hate |title = The Avengers |issue = 363 |date = June 1993}}</ref> Proctor possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, can project destructive energy beams from his eyes, telepathy, and the psionic ability to manipulate the chemical composition of the human brain.
