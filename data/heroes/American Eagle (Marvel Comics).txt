==Fictional character biography==
'''Jason Strongbow''' is a member of the [[Navajo Nation]] who was born in [[Kaibito, Arizona]].<ref name="OHOTMU">''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #1, Abomination To Avengers Quinjet (January 1983), p.8</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3et4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA195#v=onepage&q&f=false Native Americans in Comic Books: A Critical Study]</ref> He attempted to stop a [[mining]] company from excavating a mountain sacred to his tribe. He discovered that the villain [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] was in league with the mining company. Klaw needed [[uranium]] to augment his sonic powers. Strongbow's brother Ward did not agree with him about preserving the mountain. Inside the mine, an argument erupted between the brothers and Klaw which led to violence. During the fight, Klaw used his sonic blaster on the two brothers. Somehow, a combination of the sonic energy of the blast and the exposure to the uranium gave both of the Strongbow brothers enhanced physical abilities. Klaw fled with his crew and Ward to the [[Savage Land]] in hopes of gaining [[vibranium]] to augment his powers.<ref name="An Eagle From America!"/><ref name=MarvunappWardStrongbow/>

Jason emerged from the mine. Taking inspiration from a flying [[eagle]], he took up the mantle of American Eagle. He followed Klaw to the Savage Land. There, he met [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]], [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and [[Wyatt Wingfoot]]. The four joined forces and defeated Klaw and his minions. During the battle, Ward was shot and killed by one of the miners.<ref name="An Eagle From America!">[[Doug Moench]] (w), [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]] (p), [[Gene Day]] (i), [[George Roussos]] (colorist), "An Eagle From America!", ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #6 (October 1981)</ref><ref name=MarvunappWardStrongbow>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/strongbowward.htm|Ward Strongbow}}</ref>

American Eagle returned to become a champion of his tribe, subsequently identified as the Navajo Nation. Since his battle with Klaw in the Savage Land, he was among the heroes of the world gathered to take part in the [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]],<ref>[[Steven Grant]], [[Mark Gruenwald]], [[Bill Mantlo]] (w), [[John Romita Jr.]] (p), [[Pablo Marcos]] (i), "Chapter 4: Third Contest: Siege in the City of the Dead!", ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions]]'' #3 (August 1982)</ref> he was among the heroes who gathered to honor the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]],<ref>[[Bill Mantlo]] (w), [[Mark Gruenwald]] (p), [[Greg LaRocque]] (i), "Everybody Loves a Parade, Right?", ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 1 #279 (January 1983)</ref> and he was among the heroes who helped [[Rom the Spaceknight]] defeat the [[Dire Wraiths]].<ref>[[Bill Mantlo]] (w), [[Steve Ditko]] (p), [[P.

After the 2006 "[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]" storyline, Jason Strongbow confirms to his friend [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] that he is strongly against the Super-Human Registration Act, and is planning to fight [[Iron Man]] over it.<ref>[[Warren Ellis]] (w), [[Mike Deodato Jr.]] (a), "Faith in Monsters" (part 3), ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #112 (May 2007)</ref> He also bears a new costume with fewer [[Stereotype|stereotypically]] Native American attributes, including a [[leather jacket]] and a [[helmet]] resembling the head and beak of a [[bald eagle]]. It is his intent to prevent the [[Steel Spider]] from direct confrontation with an angry group of men from Jason's Navajo reservation by persuading the Steel Spider to ease up on his zealous vigilante act. By talking to Ollie, he hopes to defuse a time bomb of local violence just waiting to explode.

The Eagle finds the Steel Spider in downtown [[Phoenix, Arizona]], as the Thunderbolts unexpectedly arrive. Ollie argues that they will try to kill him and replace him with "Some Good Government Worker". When the Thunderbolts eventually do emerge, Jason decides to ally himself with Steel Spider, shooting the team's leader, [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], through the wrist with a crossbow bolt. After a prolonged fight, [[Sepulchre (comics)|Sepulchre]] becomes involved, and the three defeat [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], the [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]], [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], and [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]]. Though the latter two wish to try to defeat them using the old team's methods, leaving Sepulchre and the Eagle, Moonstone orders that [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] cripple the Eagle in the same way he did [[Jack Flag]]. The issue ends with Songbird, Radioactive Man, [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]] and Venom squaring up against Steel Spider, Sepulchre and Jason, in what Steel Spider describes as 'almost ... a fair fight'.<ref>[[Warren Ellis]] (w), [[Mike Deodato Jr.]] (a), "Faith in Monsters" (part 5), ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #114 (July 2007)</ref><ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/798/798961p1.html Thunderbolts #115 Preview]</ref> The Eagle ends up crippling Bullseye before making his escape.<ref>[[Warren Ellis]] (w), [[Mike Deodato Jr.]] (a), "Faith in Monsters" (part 6), ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #115 (August 2007)</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=11033 |title=A Storm is Brewing for the "Thunderbolts!" |author=CBR News Team |date=July 30, 2007 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref>

A news reporter stated that because American Eagle lives on a [[Indian reservation|Native American Reservation]] he is exempt from the Registration Act, and that the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] would take no action against him because of this.<ref name="Marvel Digital: Jason Aaron Talks 'American Eagle'"/><ref>[[Warren Ellis]] (w), [[Mike Deodato Jr.]] (a), "Caged Angels" (part 1), ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #116 (October 2007).

==Powers, abilities and equipment==
American Eagle possesses superhuman strength, enabling him to lift (press) approximately 15 tons under optimal conditions. He also possesses superhuman speed, agility, stamina, and sturdiness as a result of radiation-induced mutation. Strongbow's bodily tissues are somewhat harder and more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human. However, he is far from invulnerable. While he can be injured by weapons composed of conventional materials, he can withstand impact forces that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury to show for it. He can run at a maximum speed of 65 miles per hour for approximately 5 hours before tiring to an appreciable degree.<ref name="OHOTMU"/>

American Eagle's sensory organs have also been fortified by the radiation-induced mutation. Like his namesake, the Eagle, he has hyperkeen eyesight, able to see at {{convert|800|ft|m}} what the average human being sees at {{convert|20|ft|m}}. His senses of hearing, smell, taste, and touch are approximately three times that of an average human being.<ref name="OHOTMU"/>

He also carries a crossbow which fires special bolts.<ref name="OHOTMU"/>

== Analysis ==

In ''Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study'', Michael A. Sheyahshe notes that while American Eagle "may have some inherent stereotypic issues, the fact that American Eagle's powers come from a non-ethnically based source (and not, say, the Great Spirit) marks a significant improvement for Indigenous characters."<ref>{{cite book |title=Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study |last=Sheyahshe |first=Michael A. |year=2008 |publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers |isbn=978-0-7864-3565-4 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

During an interview with [[Comic Book Resources]], the [[assistant editor]] Lauren Sankovitch explains why she chose to represent American Eagle in ''Marvel Assistant-Sized Spectacular'' #1 (2009): 

{{quote|For a character whose total appearances I could count on my fingers, not to mention having some of the worst costumes in the history of tacky superherowear, I felt American Eagle had such a tremendous potential within the Marvel U as a whole. With his strong identification to his Native American heritage and disaffected attitude towards the larger superhero community, he's a principled man with his own brand of justice. Pair that with his bone-dry sense of humor and take-all-comers power set, he is a force to be reckoned with.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20783 |title=Marvel Assistants Assemble! |author=Shaun Manning |date=April 13, 2009 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref>}}

In an interview, [[Greg Pak]], the writer of the story "Homeland" in ''[[War Machine]]'' vol. 2 #6-7 (2010), told that Jason Strongbow, aka American Eagle, is easily his "favorite reinvented character of the past decade."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/8070/tuesday_qa_greg_pak |title=Tuesday Q&A: Greg Pak |author=Kevin Mahadeo |date=May 19, 2009 |work=[[Marvel.com]] |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref> Indeed, the modern character has undergone some transformations compared to its appearances from 1981 to 1994. At the beginning, the Navajo hero was wearing a stereotypical costume with [[War bonnet|feather headdress]] and [[Buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] [[boot]]s. When the writer [[Warren Ellis]] and the artist [[Mike Deodato Jr.]] used the character in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', its new look is composed of ordinary clothes, a leather jacket and a helmet resembling the head and beak of a bald eagle.<ref name="cowboysindians"/> In its first appearances, Strongbow was running under his own power, at the opposite the new version uses a [[motorcycle]].

==Other characters named American Eagle==

===World War II===
There was an American Eagle before Strongbow took the mantle. Lt. Col. James Fletcher, a renowned battlefield hero of [[World War I]] in recent times became the security chief and trainer for Project: Rebirth. He was captured by agents of the [[Red Skull]] (Johann Schmidt) and was tortured by the Master Interrogator. He refused to yield any information and committed suicide to avoid breaking under further torture. First appeared in ''[[Adventures of Captain America]]'' #1 (September 1991) and appeared through to issue #3 (December 1991) which depicted his death.<ref>[[Fabian Nicieza]] (w), [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]] (p), ''[[Adventures of Captain America]]'' #1-3 (September–December 1991)</ref>
