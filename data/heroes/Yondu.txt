'''Yondu Udonta''', or simply '''Yondu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɒ|n|d|uː}}), is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The original version of the character is depicted as the last survivor of his species in the 31st century, and is a founding member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|original Guardians of the Galaxy]] team from the Marvel [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]] alternate reality known as [[Earth-691]].

Yondu in Earth-691 is depicted as a blue-skinned male with a large red fin protruding from the back of his head and back; he is a spiritual warrior who can control his killing arrows via sound waves, most commonly by whistling. Yondu joined [[Vance Astro]] and other survivors of the [[Badoon]] attack on Earth's solar system in the 31st Century, who became known as the Guardians of the Galaxy. As part of the Guardians, Yondu traveled to present-day Earth and became an honorary member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The original Yondu never starred as a solo character in any Marvel Comic books, but was a core member of the team in the Guardians of the Galaxy comic that ran from 1990 to 1995.

A second version of Yondu was first introduced into the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] in the 2014 [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', portrayed by [[Michael Rooker]], where he is a space pirate leading one of the factions of "The Ravagers". He also appears in the film's 2017 sequel, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''. After the release of the first film, Marvel Comics introduced a comic book version of the character to the [[Earth-616]] comic book continuity.

The present day Yondu character has appeared both in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' animated show as well as being a playable character in video games.

==Fictional character biography==

===Earth-691===
Yondu Udonta is a member of the Zatoan tribe, primitive beings native to [[Centauri IV]]. He functions as a hunter. His homeworld was the first planet to be colonized by humans that was outside Earth's solar system. Yondu is born in the late thirtieth century. Yondu's people had fled from contact with overwhelming Earth colonizers who had begun arriving in 2940 A.D.

In 3006 A.D., [[Vance Astro]], an astronaut from Earth, lands on Yondu's planet with an antiquated propulsion ship. Vance encounters Yondu during the latter's trial of manhood. Yondu attacks him, but is repelled by Vance's powers. Vance keeps this secret as Yondu's action was illegal. Yondu works with Vance when the [[Badoon]], an alien race, overtakes the planet later that year. All the other Centaurians are believed to have been slaughtered. Vance and Yondu escape in his ship to fetch help but the Badoon capture them easily. The duo are taken to Earth which, by 3007 A.D., has also been conquered. When questioned, Vance pretends to be unfriendly with Yondu. They later escape and team up with [[Charlie-27]] of the [[Jupiter]] colony and [[Martinex]] of the [[Pluto]] colony, forming the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] to fight the Badoon.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #18</ref>

For the next seven years, the four survivors attack the Badoon's outposts in the solar system.

Since his newfound people will not accept his bionic weapon-hand, Yondu allows the Guardians to use their advanced medical technology to restore his flesh-and-blood hand. During their farewells, Vance apologizes for what he had thought was unacceptable treatment of Yondu during their earlier adventurers.<ref name="GotGA2">''Guardians of the Galaxy Annual'' #2</ref>

===Earth-616===
The Earth-616 version of Yondu has been identified by writer [[Sam Humphries]] as "the great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather of the Yondu in the original Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians 3000."<ref>Richards, Dave (October 22, 2015). [http://www.cbr.com/humphries-garron-chronicle-the-legendary-rise-of-star-lord/ "Humphries & Garron Chronicle the Legendary Rise of 'Star-Lord'"]. CBR.com</ref> On this Earth, Yondu is the leader of The Ravagers, a group of Space Pirates. Yondu finds [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]] when his ship malfunctions and strands him on Earth.<ref>[[Humphries, Sam]] (w), Garron, Javier (a). ''Star-Lord'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Ravagers rescue him as Peter tries to steal his ship, managing to outsmart every member of the crew and capturing Yondu. After Yondu frees himself from his restraints and attacks Peter, he gives him a choice between letting himself be released into space without more trouble or execution. Peter instead asks to join his crew. Yondu is initially skeptical of this idea, but after he learns Peter, like him, is a homeless orphan, Yondu allows him to stay on the ship with the Ravagers as their cleaning boy. Peter uses the opportunity to learn everything he can from space.<ref>Humphries, Sam (w), Garron, Javier (a). ''Star-Lord'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Star-Lord does the cleaning boy job for the Ravagers until Yondu makes him an official Ravager.<ref>''Star-Lord'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a member of the [[marsupial]] alien race of the planet Centauri IV, Yondu possesses an intuitive mystical "sixth sense" perception that permits him limited empathic relationships with other lifeforms. The higher the lifeform, the more limited is his empathic potential. Additionally, Yondu possesses an intuitive rapport with nature, particularly with his own world, but also with any world that still possesses natural wildlife. With this rapport, he can sense incongruous elements (foreign bodies or substances) or focus on specific elements within the whole (such as the location of a given plant). He is also sensitive to mystical beings and forces and is able to detect their presence and activities without effort. By going into a trance, Yondu is able to replenish his own inner strength by communing with natural forces.

Yondu is an above average physical specimen of his race. He has slightly more strength and endurance than the average human male. As a hunter, Yondu is an expert in the use of bow and arrow. His ability to whistle with a range of four octaves aids his archery (see Weapons, below). The native Centaurian language is a system of grunts, clicks, and whistles, but Yondu has managed to master the English language, although it is painful for him to speak for too long without resting his throat. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, and a highly skilled hunter and tracker. He has extensive knowledge of the social and religious customs of the natives of Centauri IV.

===Weapons===
Yondu uses a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} single curve bow and a quiver of arrows composed of ''yaka'', a special sound-sensitive metal found only on Centauri IV. A yaka arrow can actually change its direction (but not speed) in response to certain high-octave whistle-sounds some Centaurians can produce. Yondu is so skillful at controlling his arrows, he can cause an arrow to return to his hand or weave its way through a crowd of people without touching them. Yondu's arrows are {{convert|15|in|cm}} in length and are very flexible. He carries about 20 of them at one time. In ''[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]'', Yondu utilizes his expertise in archery by shooting "drone-arrows" to give the Guardians an eye in the sky.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

Yondu's right hand is replaced for a time by a bionic device called a weapons concealment appendage, a metal cup replacing his right hand.<ref name="GotG16"/> Thus, he could no longer practice archery nor perform functions requiring him to grasp with his right hand. The device can release from within itself a number of weapons, including a mace, a hatchet, a scythe, a barbed spear, and others; when not in use the weapons are concealed within the appendage at a reduced size, until enlarged by Pym particles. Yondu's bionic weapon-hand is later replaced with a duplicate of his original hand.<ref name="GotGA2"/>

Yondu initially chases after Quill after he takes an orb artifact for himself instead of turning it over to the Ravagers. After it is revealed that the orb holds the [[Infinity Gems#Film|Power Stone]], and Quill and [[Gamora]] are captured by Yondu, Yondu is persuaded to aid the Guardians in stopping [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] from using the orb to destroy Xandar with the promise of claiming the orb for himself. However, after Yondu claims the orb from Quill and departs, he learns that Quill gave him a fake that holds a [[Troll doll]] to add to his collection of small figurines, much to his amusement. Yondu and his lieutenant, [[Kraglin]], reveal in dialogue that it was Quill's father who hired Yondu to kidnap and deliver the young Peter Quill to him, but that they decided not to deliver the boy to him because Quill's father, according to Yondu, was a "jackass".

Yondu and his crew are tasked on Contraxia by Ayesha's representatives to track down and capture the Guardians. However, Yondu decides not to capture Quill and the others and instead wants the batteries that Rocket stole from the Sovereign, which infuriates most of the other Ravagers including Taserface who initiates a mutiny and Yondu is incarcerated with Rocket Raccoon and Groot. He has his fin destroyed in the process by Nebula, which is revealed as the technology enabling him to control his arrow. Yondu subsequently uses a larger fin that more closely resembles his appearance from the comics- identified as the prototype for the fin he wore in the first film- which is retrieved by Groot. With help from this last loyalist Kraglin, Yondu, Rocket, and Groot escape and destroy his ship, killing all the mutineers. Yondu then helps the Guardians defeat Ego, with Rocket and Groot proclaiming him to be part of the team thanks to his actions, and sacrifices his life to save Peter's when they exit the planet's atmosphere, Yondu using the last jetpack but giving Peter the last spacesuit. It is revealed the reason he kept Quill was because he realized Ego had slain all the other children he had sired and summoned back to him and Yondu wanted to protect Peter from that end, thinking of Peter as his son. During Yondu's funeral, Peter declares Yondu his true father. Informed about Yondu's last deeds by Rocket Raccoon, Stakar and the other Ravagers salute Yondu as a hero for his self-sacrifice.
