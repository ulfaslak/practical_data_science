==Fictional character biography==
{{External links|section|date=August 2017}}
Skaar is the son of the Hulk and Caiera the Oldstrong. He was conceived during the Hulk's time on Caiera's home planet of [[Sakaar]]. Following the Hulk's departure from the planet, Skaar emerged from a cocoon with the appearance and age equivalency of a human preteen. He matured rapidly, achieving a teenage appearance in just one year. Soon after, Skaar developed the appearance and intelligence of a full-grown adult.<ref>[[Pak, Greg]]. "Cradle of Fire" ''Skaar, Son of Hulk'' #1; Marvel Comics; August 2008</ref> To survive, Skaar learned the need to kill as part of his upbringing by the savage creatures of his home planet. He demonstrates himself to be a fierce and capable general, becoming the enemy of [[Red King (Marvel Comics)|Axeman Bone]]. He later gains the power of the stone-based "[http://marvel.com/universe/Glossary:O#Old_Power Old Power]", which allow him to draw energy from the planet itself.

Skaar was able to communicate with the spirit of his supposedly dead mother, Caiera. He fights a war against Axeman Bone but this only delays his people's escape from the near destruction of the planet by [[Galactus]], the devourer of worlds. Because the planet possesses enough energy to satiate Galactus' hunger for a hundred thousand years, Caiera takes the Old Power from Skaar as she tries to reason with him.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Return of the Silver Savage" ''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #7; Marvel Comics; March 2009</ref> Skaar admits to Caiera that he wanted to clear the evil from the planet. However, the [[Silver Surfer]] restores Skaar's Old Power and shows him a vision of the death and destruction of Sakaar leading Skaar to destroy the evacuation ships. He tells the Surfer that if he does not spare his planet, he will use the Old Power to increase Galactus' hunger and endanger more planets, including those already saved by the Surfer. After the Surfer informs the people of Sakaar that their safety would lead to the death of countless planets, he departs. Caiera denounces Skaar for his decision and absorbs his Old Power. She then exiles him from Sakaar and waits for Galactus to consume her.<ref>Pak, Greg. ''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #10. Marvel Comics. June 2009</ref>

Skaar arrives on Earth with the sole desire to kill his father, the Hulk. After conflicts with the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]], the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[Warbound]], he confronts the Hulk. Unbeknownst to Skaar, the Hulk has changed since his time on Sakaar. After the Hulk engages Skaar, he effortlessly beats him but their fight creates a fissure that endangers a nuclear power plant. Skaar ceases his attack when he realizes that this Hulk is not the "War Hulk" that conceived him, the one he desires to kill. He prevents the fissure from endangering the power plant and declares Earth to be his new home.

Skaar later encounters Bruce Banner, who had been robbed of the ability to become the Hulk by the [[Red Hulk]]. Skaar reiterates his desire to kill the Hulk, but he cannot accomplish this by killing him in Banner's form as they had separated into two distinct personas. Bruce offers to teach Skaar how to kill the Hulk, should he ever return. But this is a ruse to allow Banner to monitor his "son," and impart fatherly wisdom in the hope of turning the savage warrior into a hero. Skaar demonstrates his ability to use both cunning and physical strength by hurling the villain [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] into outer space.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Banner's Back" and "Play Date". ''Incredible Hulk'' #601-602. Marvel Comics. October - November 2009</ref> Subsequent lessons by Banner include encounters with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Wolverine's son, [[Daken]], [[Victoria Hand (comics)|Victoria Hand]], [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], a mutated [[Marlo Chandler]], [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]], the [[Mole Man]] and his army of [[Moloids]].<ref>Pak, Greg.

After defeating the Moloids, Skaar is proclaimed a hero and a parade is held in his honor. Banner confronts the Red Hulk but grows angry. He then [[Teleportation|teleports]] to the country of [[Latveria]], supposedly to transform in private but a battle breaks out between the Hulk and Latverian king [[Doctor Doom]]. Skaar soon intervenes with the aid of his father's teleportation technology as he wants to prevent Doom from robbing him of the ability to kill the Hulk. Doom overpowers Skaar with magic, reverting him to his human form and revealing that this Hulk is a robot. Banner then arrives to rescue his son, seeing him in his human form for the first time. But Skaar rejects Banner's affection, believing that Banner cares only for his deceased wife. Skaar concludes that his discovery of the teleporter and trip to Latveria are part of another of Banner's "lessons," and reiterates his desire to someday kill him in his Hulk form.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Dark Son". ''Incredible Hulk'' #606. Marvel Comics. October 2010</ref>

During the "[[Fall of the Hulks]]", "[[World War Hulks]]," and "Dark Son" storylines, Skaar comes to the aid of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by battling the [[Red She-Hulk]] in a story that involves the villainous group [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]] capturing Banner and turning people in [[Washington, D.C.]] into Hulks, including the genius [[Amadeus Cho]].<ref>Pak, Greg.

As they fight, Hulk rescues many innocent bystanders endangered by the battle. Skaar reacts to his father's compassion by ceasing his own assault and reverting to human form, but Hulk continues fighting. His actions quickly remind him of Banner's [[Brian Banner|own abusive father]], reverting him back to his human form. Banner embraces his son, who is finally willing to accept his love.<ref>Pak, Greg. "Dark Son". ''Incredible Hulk'' #611. Marvel Comics.

Skaar is recruited by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] to join the second incarnation of the [[Dark Avengers]].<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #18.

He then frees Captain America while the New Avengers defeat the remaining Dark Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Skaar later travels back to the Savage Land as it reminds him of his home planet. The Hulk in his Doc Green form tracks Skaar there in order to depower him as part of his plan to depower every Gamma mutate on Earth. After a brief fight, Skaar is finally depowered.

During the "[[Civil War II]]" storyline, Skaar is among those who learn about Bruce Banner's death.<ref>''Civil War II: The Fallen'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Skaar has powers inherited from both his parents, although the set inherited from the Hulk has since been drained. Like his father, the Hulk, he had superhuman endurance, regenerative abilities, and superhuman strength and durability, which, also like his father, increased when he was enraged. His power was such that he could break the Juggernaut's armor, although he was not as strong as the Savage Hulk persona. Skaar could boost his strength further with Old Power - a synthesized form of the [[Galactus|Power Cosmic]]{{issue|date=August 2014}}, in one instance absorbing the energy of an entire city.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Greg Pak|penciller=[[Paul Pelletier]]|inker=Danny Miki|story=Sons of Wrath|title=Incredible Hulk|volume=1|issue=611|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=October 2010}}</ref> [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] is able to daze him with a powerful chi-punch.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> He could revert to a human form when calm or otherwise incapacitated. However, in Skaar's case, his other form is half-human, half-Oldstrong. From his mother, Caiera, he has the powers of an Oldstrong, emerging from his birth cocoon able to walk and talk within moments. He can also draw power from the planet and harden his body.<ref>''Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook''. Marvel Comics.</ref> Having been born within the depths of a lake of lava, Skaar is resistant to intense heat.<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
In the 2007 ''[[List of What If issues#Sixth Series (2007)|What If?]]'' storyline "What if Caiera the Oldstrong had survived the destruction of Sakaar instead of the Hulk?", a 21-year-old version of Skaar appeared near the end, partially seen and obscured by shadows.{{issue|date=November 2011}}
