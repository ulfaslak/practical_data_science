'''Kate Margaret Power''' (also known as '''Energizer'''), is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Power Pack]]'' #1 and was created by [[Louise Simonson]] and [[June Brigman]].

==Publication history==

Katie Power debuted as '''Energizer''' in ''Power Pack'' #1 (cover date August 1984), and used this superhero alter-ego between issues 1-25, then (after a power-swap) continued to star under the name '''Starstreak''' between issues 25-52, after which she took the name '''Counterweight''' for issues 52-62 (changing her costume in issue 47), before returning to her original codename (and costume) as Energizer in the ''Power Pack Holiday Special'' and subsequent 4-issue ''Power Pack'' miniseries published in 2000 - in the latter, she wore a different costume not previously seen.  Katie did not resurface in the Marvel Universe until her appearance as a potential candidate for the [[Great Lakes Avengers]] in issue 2 of the ''GLA: MISASSEMBLED'' miniseries, where she is seen wearing her Power Pack costume from the ''[[Marvel Adventures]]'' range of Power Pack titles while operating as a solo superhero, in ''[[Loners]]'' #4, she was purportedly the recipient of a phone call from her sister Julie - though Katie was not seen during this conversation and in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #574, where she was among the guests for [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]' birthday party.  The character has since made appearances in several of Marvel's 'alternate continuity' imprints, most notably as a recurring cast member in several ''Marvel Adventures'' and [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] titles (see bibliography at foot of page).

==Fictional character biography==
Katie Power was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Her full name is given as "Kate (Katie) Margret Power" in ''Power Pack'' #47.{{fact|date=May 2016}} The youngest of the four Power siblings, she was only 5 years old when she was given her powers by Aelfyre Whitemane, a dying Kymellian noble.<ref>''Power Pack'' #1</ref> Katie and her siblings then form the superhero team [[Power Pack]].

When she first receives her powers, Katie is highly suggestible. She is frequently goaded into using her powers by her siblings and looks to them for instructions. Consequently, she is responsible for significant damage to both buildings and some of Power Pack's enemies. Her eldest brother, unofficial team leader Alex, bullies her to such an extent that she compares him to Power Pack's archenemy, [[Queen Maraud]].<ref name="Pack25">''Power Pack'' #25</ref> At one point, Julie observes that Katie is bullied into using her powers even when she's scared or thinks it's wrong to hurt others, and that she later regrets the damage she does.<ref name="Pack23">''Power Pack'' #23</ref> For instance, during the team's first encounter with [[Kurse]] during ''[[Secret Wars II]]'', Katie realizes that Kurse is completely disoriented and hesitates when she is asked to blast him. After she is finally bullied into destroying a building and crushing Kurse, she immediately worries that she has killed him.<ref name="Pack18">''Power Pack'' #18</ref>

Katie grows into a much more assertive and sensitive individual. When she witnesses the physical damage she had done to [[Jakal]] and [[Kurse]], she begins to realize the magnitude of her actions.{{issue|date=May 2016}} In the Snark Wars, she saves her siblings' lives, loses her energy powers and gains the flight/acceleration abilities formerly held by her sister Julie. Katie emerges as a stronger character, ignores her siblings when they try to get her to do things she doesn't agree with, and refuses to use her powers to seriously harm people.<ref name="Pack25"/> By issue #36, Alex observes that Katie is no longer a "dumb little kid".<ref name="Pack36">''Power Pack'' #36</ref> 

[[Image:Powerpackcover1.jpg|thumb|right|Katie Power (as Starstreak) fights Pestilence in the ''Fall of the Mutants'' crossover.]]
After the Snark Wars, whenever possible, Katie attempts to act as a rescuer. During ''[[The Fall of the Mutants]]'', Katie even tries to save [[Plague (comics)|Pestilence]], in spite of the fact that the villain had just made her ill.<ref>''Power Pack'' #35</ref><ref>''X-Factor'' #25</ref>

In spite of her youth, Katie has been a key member of Power Pack, and has played major roles in most of the team's battles. In numerous instances, she has rescued the entire team, uncovered crucial information and provided critical support in missions. When the Pack encountered [[Master Mold]], for instance, Katie saved [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]' life by flying right under the giant robot's foot.<ref>''Power Pack'' #36</ref> In a separate incident, Power Pack was captured by evil mutants called the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], and only Katie escaped. She managed to save her siblings with the help of some [[X-Men]], and was given honorary status by the team.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #195</ref> In another memorable incident, she found herself lost in a blinding snowstorm in [[Manhattan, New York|Manhattan]], where she encountered a seriously injured and disoriented [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. She was able to assist him in his flight from [[Lady Deathstrike]] and the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] until he healed enough to neutralize his enemies.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #205</ref>  Katie also had another solo adventure at some point in which she was brought into conflict with the agents of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], whom she defeated while being 'scouted' as a potential recruit for the [[Great Lakes Avengers]], but not being familiar with her would-be recruiter, [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]] (who was attempting to coerce her into accompanying him after approaching her in the dead of night), she refused membership.<ref>''GLA: Misassembled'' #2</ref>

Katie is highly intelligent; at five she was literate and able to write fluently enough to compose a "War Journal", copying the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' (vol. 2) #13-14</ref> She is later depicted as a genius who has skipped several grades of school and can program supercomputers.<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 2) #1</ref>

In the original series, Katie had a close, sibling-like relationship with the fifth Power Pack member, Franklin Richards. The two did not become friends immediately; during Franklin's first encounter with Power Pack, Katie disliked him on sight. She was jealous of the attention he received from the other members of the Pack, and perceived him as usurping her role as the "littlest superhero" and the team baby. However, after Franklin showed his courage in battle with Jakal, despite his lack of any "active" powers to defend himself, Katie's opinion of him improved considerably.<ref>''Power Pack'' #16-17</ref> Their relationship after their initial adventure was much more amicable, though still flavored with a pseudo-sibling rivalry. Franklin's superhero codename, "Tattletale", was taken at Katie's suggestion. Katie (along with her brothers Jack and Alex) was among the guests invited at Franklin's birthday party.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #574</ref> Katie, along with Jack and Julie, were summoned by her brother Alex to help the Future Foundation deal against the threat of Sol's Anvil.<ref>''FF'' #15</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Katie began her superhero career as Energizer. She could disintegrate any kind of matter, including water and air molecules, store the energy and expel it in balls of explosive energy. Katie's Energizer power was highly destructive, potentially lethal, and in various issues, was able to destroy buildings and bring down supervillains such as [[Kurse]]. Katie initially had little control over her power, and tended to use it when she was frightened or angry, but as the series progressed, she gained control over her abilities.

During the Snark Wars, Katie voluntarily relinquished her energy powers to the [[Zn'rx|Snark]] prince Jakal. Her siblings had already had their abilities forcibly taken from them by Jakal. In the ensuing battle, the powers reverted to the Power siblings one by one and Katie ended up with Julie's flight powers.

While she held Julie's flight powers, Katie was known as '''Starstreak.''' She was able to fly quickly, leaving a stream of rainbow light in her wake. While Katie as Starstreak was never able to break the sound barrier as her sister Julie supposedly did, she did refine the power by developing hovering abilities.<ref>''Power Pack'' #25-52</ref>

After Queen Mother Maraud briefly gained the abilities of Power Pack in ''Power Pack'' #52, Katie ended up with the gravity powers previously held by her brothers Alex and Jack. She took the same code name Jack had used, '''Counterweight.''' She was able to float, "gravitize" to any surface, and cancel the gravity of any object she touched. She was also able to increase her own gravity to deliver "Super-G" powerful punches and make herself extremely heavy.<ref>''Power Pack'' #52-61</ref>

During Power Pack's mission in the Technocrat's space station, Katie regained her original energy powers.<ref>''Power Pack Holiday Special''</ref>  She continues to use these abilities under her original name of '''Energizer.'''<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 2) #1-4</ref>

Along with her siblings, Katie possessed Kymellian healing powers. Usually, she was required to work with her siblings to generate and use this ability; however, she occasionally accessed it on her own.<ref>''Power Pack'' #24</ref>

Katie and her siblings also owned a Kymellian smartship called [[Smartship Friday|Friday]]. The ship acted as an unofficial team advisor and accompanied the Pack on several missions.

Throughout her affiliation with Power Pack, Katie wears a costume of [[unstable molecules]] created by Friday. The costume exists in an extra-dimensional space known as "Elsewhere" until summoned by voice command (the wearer would say the words "costume on!"). The costume also houses a communicator which is used to communicate with Friday, and was later modified to include a mask.<ref>''Power Pack'' (Vol.2)</ref>  As with all the team's costumes, the pockets of the costume can be used as an access point to Elsewhere itself, where the cartoon-like creatures known simply as "The Tailors" reside in a colorful wonderland of talking dinosaurs, enchanted forests, mad monarchs, surreal architecture and malleable physical laws.<ref>''Power Pack'' #47</ref> Katie was the only member of Power Pack to actually visit Elsewhere; while there, she learned how to modify the team's costumes.

Katie also owned a gold Kymellian coin, which was a present from her "honorary godfather", Lord Byrel. Both the Pack's enemies and allies were able to use the coin as a tracking device to locate the team.<ref>''Power Pack'' #15-16</ref>
