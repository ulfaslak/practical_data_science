==Characterization==
Captain Midlands is a [[patriotic]] [[United Kingdom|British]] [[war veteran]] and a right-wing analogue of [[Captain America (set index)|Captain America]]. An eighty-year-old [[Brummie]]<ref name="meet">[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.5115.MI_13~colon~_Meet_Captain_Midlands MI 13: Meet Captain Midlands], [[Marvel.com]], September 24, 2008</ref> superhero, Captain Midlands is often portrayed as a [[Irritable Male Syndrome|grumpy old git]]. His real name, "Rambling" Sid Ridley, is a combination of [[Kenneth Williams]]' ''[[Round the Horne]]'' character ‘Rambling Sid Rumpo’ and [[Arnold Ridley]] who played [[Private Godfrey]] in the [[sitcom]] ''[[Dad's Army]]''.<ref name="W1C">{{cite web |title=Wisdom Issue One Commentary.

Captain Midlands' nuanced role sees him more as a down-to-earth hero, with Paul Cornell describing him as

{{quote|the representative of my dad's generation, those who fought in World War II, which is still big in the British psyche. He also tends to look backwards, while Pete Wisdom looks forwards, thus also representing that trait of the British.<ref name="meet"/>}}

==Fictional character biography==
As part of the 1940s British Super-Soldier program,<ref name="CBR">{{cite web|title=Paul Cornell Shares His "Wisdom".

He has got the opinions and a personality of an eighty-year-old man but the abilities and strength of Captain America. He's a bit of a tragic figure in many ways.}}</ref> Sid Ridley is transformed into a "perfect" specimen of human development and conditioning then sent off to be part of the British Army's war effort.

After serving as '''Captain Midlands''' in [[World War II]], Ridley somehow ended up in [[British Intelligence]] and eventually [[MI-13 (Marvel Comics)|MI-13]].<ref name="Wisdom#1"/> Ridley also suggested that he had "knocked a girl up" (got her pregnant) and married her before she died in 1963.<ref name="Wisdom#3">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Manuel García Ferré|Manuel Garcia]] | Inker = [[Mark Farmer]] | Story = The Rudiments of Wisdom.

Captain Midlands served alongside other British heroes, including [[Captain Britain]] and [[Pete Wisdom]] in MI-13, fighting supernatural threats such as [[fairies]],<ref name="Wisdom#1"/> [[Y Ddraig Goch]],<ref name="Wisdom#3"/> alternate reality [[Jack the Ripper]]s and [[Martians]]. He was also reported to be fighting the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] of Britain.<ref name="CB&MI13#1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = The Guns Of Avalon | Title = [[Captain Britain and MI: 13]] | Issue = 1 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

When MI:13 refocused itself against a supernatural pandemic, Captain Midlands - while carrying out routine crimefighting - identified a demonic incursion in Birmingham and called it in to the agency. He was captured and imprisoned in a [[council estate]] basement, being tempted to give his soul for an unknown desire. He was freed by and joined Pete Wisdom's strike team.<ref name="CBMI6">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = Hell In Birmingham | Title = [[Captain Britain and MI: 13]] | Issue = 6 | Date = December 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> However, this was a ploy by Captain Midlands to lead the group into a trap so he could get his heart's desire, to spend eternity with his dead wife.<ref name="CBMI8">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = Hell In Birmingham | Title = [[Captain Britain and MI: 13]] | Issue = 8 | Date = February 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

Wisdom, disgusted with Sid's treachery, deliberately destroyed the illusion of Sid's dead wife. After the team escaped, he was arrested in view of the public and imprisoned in The Vault, a high security prison in [[Shoreditch]]. In an act of mercy, Wisdom gave Sid the chance to kill himself and avoid humiliation in a trial - although it was left ambiguous as to which option Ridley took.<ref name="CBMI9">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = Hell In Birmingham | Title = [[Captain Britain and MI: 13]] | Issue = 9 | Date = January 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

==Abilities and equipment==
Captain Midlands has no superhuman powers, although as a result of the 1940s British Super-Soldier program Sid Ridley was transformed into a "perfect" specimen of human development and conditioning. Captain Midlands' strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, agility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance are at the highest limits of natural human potential, and despite being an eighty-year-old man he still has a body of a superhero.<ref name="CBR"/>

Captain Midlands wears full [[Disruptive Pattern Material|DPM]] military fatigues and helmet with a cowl mask (similar to the World War II [[Ultimate Captain America]] outfit) and wields a golden [[Captain America's shield|circular shield]] in the design of the traditional lion symbol of Britain and coated in an anti-magic [[nanominium]] gloss.<ref name="Wisdom#1"/>

==Reception==
When the character became popular, creator, Paul Cornell decided to add more drama to the character by making him a traitor to the team; stating:

{{quote|Well that’s my job! I’d noticed he’d become quite beloved, so thus we’ve got to shake his life up a little bit and put some drama into it! And you know, if one gets drama inserted into one’s life that’s often a very terrible thing. So it’s my job to make you love these characters and then to hurt them.<ref>[http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/123485785263811.htm "Paul Cornell: From the Doctor to the New Avengers"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227104513/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/123485785263811.htm |date=February 27, 2009 }}, [[Comicsbulletin]], February 17, 2009</ref>}}
