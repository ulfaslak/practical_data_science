'''Spider-Girl''' is the [[code name]] of two fictional characters in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] in two different universes. One is [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Mayday Parker]] from the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe and the other is [[Anya Corazon]] in the [[Earth-616]] universe.

==Publication history==
The first portrayed Spider-Girl, [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Mayday Parker]], first appeared in a one-shot story in the ongoing series ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]''. Following positive fan response to the concept, ''Spider-Girl'' and two other series (''[[A-Next]]'' and ''[[J2 (comics)|J2]]'') set in the same alternate future universe were launched under the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] imprint with ''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' and ''Spectacular Spider-Girl''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004386 |title=Panels &#124; Comic Book, Graphic Novel and Cartooning Discussions – Forums powered by UBB.threads™ |publisher=Comicon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218045707/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004386 |archivedate=2012-02-18 |df= }}</ref> <ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18419 DeFalco Confirms Amazing Spider-Girl Cancellation], [[Comic Book Resources]], October 13, 2008</ref>  On November 8, 2008, Marvel EIC [[Joe Quesada]] confirmed that Spider-Girl would become a feature in the monthly anthology magazine ''Amazing Spider-Man Family''. The series would replace the feature "[[Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man]]", written by DeFalco, which served as a prequel series to the Spider-Girl universe. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20467 |title=Spider-Girl Returns in Marvel Digital Comics |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref>  The title would continue to be simultaneously published in paper form within ''Amazing Spider-Man Family''. ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #5 (published April 2009) through #8 (July 2009) contained these Spider-Girl stories until the title's cancellation with issue #8. Followed by one last Spider girl tale, ''Spider-Girl: The End''.

In November 2010, a new ''Spider-Girl'' series was launched that was unconnected to the MC2 universe. The MC2 Spider-Girl title was cancelled, having surpassed publisher expectations for longevity. The new series featured a new character, [[Anya Corazon]], whose adventures occurred on [[Earth 616]]. The series was canceled after only eight issues. No official reason was given for the cancellation. This character returned for a "Spider Island" limited series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2010/07/16/spider-girl-1-starring-arana-for-november-respectfully-we-informed-you-of-this-event-an-an-earlier-juncture/ |title=Spider-Girl #1 Starring Araña For November – Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movies and TV News and Rumors |publisher=Bleedingcool.com |date=2010-07-16 |accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref>
