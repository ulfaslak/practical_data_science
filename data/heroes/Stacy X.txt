'''Stacy X''' (real name '''Miranda Leevald''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[prostitute]] who was briefly affiliated with the [[X-Men]] and was later known as a member of the [[New Warriors]].

She later became known as '''Ripcord'''.

==Fictional character biography==
X-Stacy first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #399 (November 2001). Her real name is Miranda Leevald, and she has the mutant ability to exude [[pheromones]] which she could control to stimulate bodily sensations and functions of others, such as causing [[orgasm]]s or [[vomiting]]. Her mutation also had a physical manifestation: at the age of sixteen Stacy's skin was replaced by patterned, snake-like scales. At one point her skin was shown shedding, much like a real snake's.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #399''. Marvel Comics</ref> She later became known as Stacy-X.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #403. Marvel Comics</ref>

She first appeared as a member of the [[Nevada]] mutant [[brothel]], the [[X-Ranch]]. After the [[hate group]] the [[Church of Humanity (comics)|Church of Humanity]] destroys the ranch, Stacy joins the X-Men. Forthright and argumentative, Stacy did not take easily to teamwork and left the team shortly after joining. She plays a vital role in fighting [[Black Tom Cassidy|Black Tom]], using her powers to seduce him and releasing the other trapped X-Men, allowing them to defeat him. She also proved to be a highly skilled fighter, even giving Wolverine a proper [[workout]]. Where she got this training is unknown, much like everything else about her past.<ref name= "UX 402-413">''Uncanny X-Men'' #402–413. Marvel Comics</ref>

Soon after the events at the X-Ranch, Stacy stayed at the Institute. She took some time off after "servicing" a special client in [[Chappaqua, New York]]. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] tracked her down and fought with her, but soon the two came to an understanding. Whether Wolverine convinced Stacy to completely abandon her former profession is unknown, but he did talk [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] out of whatever censure he was contemplating. It was known that Stacy continued to "work" for special clients even as she operated as a member of the X-Men. Furthermore, during her membership with the X-Men she tried to seduce members [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] and Nightcrawler.<ref name= "UX 402-413" />

She became a team member who was highly depended upon. At one point when [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] and Nightcrawler were stranded in the mountains, Chamber telepathically communicated with Stacy X. While she brought help, she was upset that Chamber invaded her mind without permission until Chamber told her she was the only one he thought would believe him as his telepathic powers were still new.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #417''. Marvel Comics</ref>>

At one point, Miranda works with a food magnate who is very sick. He reveals himself as a mutant with debilitating mutations: advanced aging has made him old before his time, and he has developed an immunity to all painkillers. She changes his body chemistry so that he will live out the rest of his short life without pain.<ref name= "UX 402-413"/>

After a spat with [[Husk (comics)|Paige (alias Husk)]], caused by the fact that they both were in love with Archangel, Miranda decides to leave the mansion. (She knew about Paige's love as she could see her lust with her ability to see people's emotions through their pheromones.) However, she left behind for Archangel a video of herself jumping rope naked, stating that she did not want to stay around them. Rather, this will indicate to him that he missed the chance to have had someone as sexy as herself as a girlfriend, instead of Paige.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #422''. Marvel Comics</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #414. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Decimation and New Warriors===
Due to the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s magic, Miranda is one of the many mutants to lose her powers after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. While she was a prostitute when she had her powers, she never actually slept with anyone for money, relying on her pheromone powers. Since she lost her powers, this has apparently changed.<ref name="New Warriors 1-20">''[[New Warriors]]'' #1–20. Marvel Comics</ref>

She becomes a member of the reformed [[New Warriors]] under the codename Ripcord. The circumstances of how she joined are not completely revealed, but her attitude and statements show that she wanted to change her life, and going back to being a hero seems like the path she chose best to do it.  Besides being given artificial powers to replace what she lost, she apparently also has lost her leftover scaled skin.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #6. Marvel Comics</ref> She was killed in an accident along with [[Redneck (comics)|Skybolt]].<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #16. Marvel Comics</ref>

===''Vengeance''===
Stacy X mysteriously re-appears in 2011's ''Vengeance'' limited series, the official sequel to the 1989/1990 crossover ''Acts of Vengeance''. Stacy is shown having a [[menage a trois|three-way sexual encounter]] with Welsh [[Celebrity|pop star]] [[Sugar Kane (comics)|Sugar Kane]] (Chamber's onetime girlfriend) and new character [[Ultimate Nullifier]] in a high-rise hotel room after they are at a nightclub. The trio is interrupted by the sudden arrival of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who seeks to discipline Stacy for what he considers to be her disgraceful decadence which is embarrassingly tarnishing the collective image of Earth's too few remaining mutants. Magneto proceeds to magnetically thrash the room and toss all of them around. However, Ultimate Nullifier engages in combat with Magneto while Stacy and Sugar Kane make their escape. Successfully subduing Magneto by depowering him with a power-dampening gun and beating him with formidable martial arts skills, Ultimate Nullifier then reveals to Magneto that he was actually secretly acting as a bodyguard to Stacy and that it is his mission to protect her from Magneto.<ref>''Vengeance'' #1–6. Marvel Comics</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Stacy had snake-like, scaly skin that gave her an unknown degree of durability. She could control other's pheromones through skin contact, producing sensations and physical reactions in anyone she touches. She was able to heal others by speeding up their healing process, and increase their stamina by giving her teammates a rush of adrenaline so that they wouldn't easily tire.{{issue|date=March 2015}}

Stacy is an expert fighter, able to even challenge Wolverine, though she was eventually beaten by him.{{Issue|date=August 2011}} However, this skill appears to be learned and not mutant in nature.{{issue|date=March 2015}}

Since joining the New Warriors as Ripcord, she has been given a special armor which has extensible metal tentacles that extend from her wrists and can be used as weapons.<ref name="New Warriors 1-20"/> She is also equipped with [[Spider-Man|web shooters]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)|frog springs]], and a [[Slyde]] suit.

Marvel Comics</ref> In ''[[Ultimate Comics: X-Men]]'' she is seen in Camp Angel, camps where mutants are forced to live by the government in the aftermath of the [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum Wave]].

==Reception==
{{section expand|date=September 2017}}
''[[Screen Rant]]'' ranked Stacy X as one of the superheroes that Marvel wants you to forget, citing her presence in X-Men stories as being based entirely on sex appeal.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Byrd|first1=Matthew|title=15 Superheroes Marvel Wants You To Forget|url=http://screenrant.com/worst-superheroes-marvel-wants-you-to-forget-embarassing/|website=Screen Rant|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=29 August 2017}}</ref>
