{{quote|Kid Kaiju and Elsa help to keep the team grounded. They’re the humans who interact with these giant monsters and help to make them more relatable. Kid Kaiju and Elsa have very different beliefs when it comes to monsters. Kid Kaiju is a monster superfan. He loves them. Elsa loves to kill them. That’s going to put them at odds sometimes, but they might also learn something from one another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-monsters-unleashed-ongoing-series-cullen-bunn/|title=INTERVIEW: Bunn Opens Up on Monsters Unleashed’s New Ongoing Series|last=Richards|first=Dave|website=CBR|date=January 20, 2017|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}</ref>}}
