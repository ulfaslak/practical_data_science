==Publication history==
The character, created by [[Nunzio DeFilippis]] and [[Christina Weir]], first appeared in ''New Mutants'' Vol. 2 #7. DeFilippis revealed that while he and Weir created the character, he was based on a background mutant from ''New X-Men: Academy X'', #7. "We saw a cool bit of artwork in the background of a panel (I think it was Carlo Barberi who first drew him) and thought for a few seconds about a name, codename, and power set."<ref name="DeFilippisWeir" />

==Fictional character biography==
While spending time in his home town park, Ben Hamill suddenly manifested his mutant powers. Unable to control his powers, Ben set flame to the town's park.

===Xavier Institute===
After the manifestation of his powers, Ben was enrolled in the [[X-Mansion|Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters]]. While at the school, he chose the codename Match, where he was present at Xavier's special assembly head by the headmaster [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] to inform the student body of an explosion that happened the night before caused by Magma who'd been awoken from a coma by [[Elixir (comics)|Josh]] and [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Julian's]] involvement. Xavier preached about heroism being more than being brave.<ref>''New X-Men II'' #7.

==Powers and abilities==
Ben's abilities are pyrokinesis, enabling him to produce and manipulate flame. In addition, he is seemingly immune to fire and high temperatures. As a side effect of his powers, Ben's head remains constantly aflame, though it appears that he can control the extent of the flaming; during a Danger Room session, he is able to maintain some level of stealth by lowering the intensity of his head flame.  Ben's body is always glowing, and emits heat, however it is not hot enough to burn his clothing. The flame on his head is also not as hot as normal fire and as such, it does not burn what it touches. This was confirmed by his creators, Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir.

==In other media==
Match briefly appears in ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' portrayed by [[Lamar Johnson (actor)|Lamar Johnson]]. The character's appearance was so minor and unnoticed that his creators were caught off guard when they earned sudden payment for the character's use. DeFilippis stated "Totally grateful and excited...but...Match? Really?"<ref name="DeFilippisWeir">{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/09/07/character-x-men-dark-phoenix/|title=When You Get Paid For a Character No One Realised Was in X-Men: Dark Phoenix|website=Bleeding Cool News|last=Johnston|first=Rich|date=September 7, 2019|accessdate=September 7, 2019}}</ref>
