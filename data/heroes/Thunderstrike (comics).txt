'''Thunderstrike''' is the name of two fictional characters appearing in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It is also the name of the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] weapon.

==History==
===Eric Masterson===
[[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson]] is the original Thunderstrike and a 1993 series he starred in. Eric Masterson is an architect that first met Thor. After his time as a host for [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] created a weapon that Eric would use as he takes up the name Thunderstrike.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #1.

The first introduced appeared under the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] imprint in the Series ''[[A-Next]]'', an alternate future version of the Avengers. A second version from the present of the mainstream Marvel Universe later appeared.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Item==
Thunderstrike is a magical [[Mace (bludgeon)|mace]] that is made of mystic uru metal, which is nearly indestructible, crafted by the Asgardian [[Dwarves (Marvel Comics)|Dwarves]] Brokk and Eitri and given the following enchantments by Odin. Stamping the mace reverts Thunderstrike back to Eric's mortal human form, dressed in whichever clothes he last wore in that form, with any physical damage fully healed with the exception of certain mystical spells such as Seth's Mark of Death, while the mace Thunderstrike transforms into a wooden cane. By stamping his walking stick on the ground Eric Masterson transformed back into his superhuman form, bearded and dressed in the garb of Thunderstrike, while the cane again becomes the mace.<ref>''Thor'' #459. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The mace itself can be thrown over great distances and return to the point it is thrown from. By throwing the mace and gripping the strap, Thunderstrike can fly (although the comic emphasizes that this is much rockier and less steady than Thor's flight). He can use the mace to fire powerful concussive blasts of mystical energy. The mace magically enables him to survive the adverse conditions of outer space, including its lack of oxygen. The mace can also be used for tracking various energy sources and has the ability to create mystical vortices to travel from one place to another.

==In other media==
The Thunderstrike mace appeared in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode "All Things Must End."<ref>{{cite episode|title=All Things Must End|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=25|airdate=March 11, 2018}}</ref> After [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] was defeated, [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] gave Mjolnir back to Thor and Odin made a new weapon for Jane Foster's Thor form called Thunderstrike.
