'''Spider-Man''' ('''Peter Parker''') is a fictional character, a [[superhero]] developed and created by [[Insomniac Games]] originally for the ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game released in 2018. Based on [[Spider-Man|the original character]] created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]]. The character was created with contributions from various writers such as Jon Parquette, Benjamin Arfmann, Kelsey Beachum, [[Christos Gage]] and [[Dan Slott]] and is voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]. He has two signature suits. One is called the advanced suit and the other is the velocity suit designed by [[Adi Granov]].

Insomniac's Spider-Man is depicted as a more mature and experienced version of the character, who has battled various [[List of Spider-Man enemies|super-villains]] in his eight-year career as the city's protector while still struggling to balance his superhero alter-ego with his life as Peter Parker.

The character was later established in [[Marvel Comics]] continuity as an [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|alternate version of Spider-Man]] within the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]] of the [[shared universe]] in an alternate reality called "Earth-1048" otherwise known as the Marvel Gamerverse. He has received a book adaptation along with spinoff comic book series starring the new take of the superhero. Insomniac's take on the superhero has received a widely positive reception critically for their work on the older and more mature role in comparison to [[Spider-Man in other media|to other adaptions]] of the character. The character was marketed around early 2018 during the hype of the superhero video game release in the [[PlayStation 4]] and his design has gone through various merchandise.

Several characters from [[Marvel Comics]] were considered to have their own game developed by [[Insomniac Games]] but the team's final choice was to adapt [[Spider-Man]] in [[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|his own video game]]. This was due to him and his true identity Peter Parker being more relatable to the staff than other Marvel characters such as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Iron Man]], a sentiment that Insomniac CEO [[Ted Price]] shared.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |last=Barnett |first=Brian |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2018/09/10/how-insomniacs-spider-man-came-to-be-ign-unfiltered |title=How Insomniac's Spider-Man Came To Be |date=September 10, 2018 |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=January 17, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190117221649/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/10/how-insomniacs-spider-man-came-to-be-ign-unfiltered |archivedate=January 17, 2019 |url-status=live |ref=harv }}</ref><ref name="web">{{cite web |last=Watts |first=Steve |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-how-insomniac-spun-its-web/1100-6464062/ |title=Marvel's Spider-Man: How Insomniac Spun Its Web |date=December 21, 2018 |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=January 17, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190117225448/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-how-insomniac-spun-its-web/1100-6464062/ |archivedate=January 17, 2019 |url-status=live |ref=harv }}</ref> Spider-Man then became the first licensed property by Insomniac in 22 years.<ref name="license">{{cite web |last=Mathew |first=Adam |url=https://www.redbull.com/au-en/insomniac-developer-interview-spider-man-ps4 |title=How deep is Insomniac's PS4 Spider-sensibility? |date=November 1, 2017 |publisher=[[Red Bull]] |accessdate=January 16, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190116130437/https://www.redbull.com/au-en/insomniac-developer-interview-spider-man-ps4 |archivedate=January 16, 2019 |url-status=live |ref=harv }}</ref>

Intihar collaborated with a team of writers under lead writer Jon Paquette to create an original take on Spider-Man that remained true to the original.<ref name="web"/> Paquette is cited to commonly subscribed to Spider-Man (''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'') and also Thor [[American comic book|comic books]] at the  "[[Boondocks|boonies]]" at a younger age before his time attending film school.<ref>{{cite web |title='Marvel's Spider-Man' is basically a playable superhero movie |url=https://ew.com/gaming/2018/08/02/marvels-spider-man-video-game-preview/ |website=EW.com |accessdate=28 August 2019 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828024415/https://ew.com/gaming/2018/08/02/marvels-spider-man-video-game-preview/ |archive-date=August 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Alongside Paquette, the story was written by Ben Arfman and Kelsey Beachum.

One lesson the team took from the research was that whenever Spider-Man wins, Peter Parker loses, and vice versa. Intihar said that from conception, the game was designed to be as much Parker's story as Spider-Man's.<ref name="web"/> The team deliberately avoided retelling Spider-Man's origin, reasoning  that everyone knows Spider-Man was bitten by a radioactive spider.<ref name="Changes"/>

[[Yuri Lowenthal]] provides the voice of Spider-Man / Peter Parker, but there was some initial reluctance to cast him as he had previously voiced a characteristically-different lead character in ''[[Sunset Overdrive]]'' and it was thought that he was not capable of providing a drastically different performance.<ref name="voice">{{cite web |last=Ruppert |first=Liana |url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/04/04/spider-man-ps4-peter-parker-yuri-lowenthal/ |title=Spider-Man PS4 Lead Voice Actor Almost Rejected by Insomniac |date=April 4, 2018 |website=comicbook.com |accessdate=January 22, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190122222500/https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/04/04/spider-man-ps4-peter-parker-yuri-lowenthal/ |archivedate=January 22, 2019 |url-status=live |ref=harv }}</ref> Paquette trusted his acting ability however, and convinced the studio to cast him.<ref name="voice 2"/> Working with voice director Kris Zimmerman, Lowenthal tried to differentiate his voices for Parker in his civilian life where he is more gentle, and as Spider-Man, where he is more confident. As a result, he spent a large amount of time working on his performance to achieve a balance. Lowenthal worked with two stunt people throughout the game's development.<ref name="voice commentary">{{cite web |last=Salazar-Moreno |first=Quibian |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/interview-yuri-lowenthal-being-voice-spider-man-and-his-new-show-orbital-redux/20918 |title=Interview: Yuri Lowenthal On Being The Voice Of Spider-Man And His New Show, Orbital Redux |date=September 28, 2018 |publisher=[[Newegg]] |website=GameCrate.com |accessdate=January 23, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190123220350/https://www.gamecrate.com/interview-yuri-lowenthal-being-voice-spider-man-and-his-new-show-orbital-redux/20918 |archivedate=January 23, 2019 |url-status=live |ref=harv }}</ref><ref name="voice 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/04/exclusive-interview-with-the-man-playing-spider-man.aspx|title=Exclusive Interview With The Man Playing Spider-Man|date=April 4, 2018|last=Vader|first=Leo|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=April 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405043238/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/04/exclusive-interview-with-the-man-playing-spider-man.aspx|archive-date=April 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Insomniac wanted to modernize the design of Spider-Man's costume while paying homage to the original design by [[Steve Ditko]]. The new advanced costume design the traditional red-and-blue color scheme, a large white spider symbol stretching across the torso, gauntlet-like gloves, and sneaker-style design based on athletic wear instead of knee-high boots.<ref name="costume"/> Art director Jacinda Chew said the design goal was to create what a "23-year-old, would-be superhero" would wear in 2018 New York City. Chew compared the outfit to [[Compression garment|compression wear]], and said each color represented different materials. Blue is the most flexible, red is thicker for added protection from minor injury, and white offers the most protection, as it covers his chest, hands, and feet.<ref name="costume">{{cite web |last=Saveedra |first=John |title=Spider-Man PS4: New Spidey Costume Explained |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/spider-man/276206/spider-man-ps4-new-spidey-costume-explained |date=September 11, 2018 |website=DenofGeek! |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]] |accessdate=January 16, 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190116114326/https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/spider-man/276206/spider-man-ps4-new-spidey-costume-explained |archivedate=January 16, 2019 |url-status=live |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Vader |first1=Leo |title=Designing The Look Of Spider-Man |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/20/designing-the-look-of-spider-man.aspx |website=Game Informer |accessdate=28 August 2019 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828041108/https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/20/designing-the-look-of-spider-man.aspx |archive-date=August 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
