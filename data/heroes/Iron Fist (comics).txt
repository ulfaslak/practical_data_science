'''Iron Fist''' ('''Daniel''' "'''Danny'''" '''Rand''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]], Iron Fist first appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #15 (May 1974). The character is a practitioner of [[martial arts]] and the wielder of a mystical force known as the Iron Fist, which allows him to summon and focus his ''[[Qi|chi]]''. He starred in his own solo series in the 1970s, and shared the title ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' for several years with [[Luke Cage]], partnering with Cage to form the superhero team [[Heroes for Hire]]. The character has starred in numerous solo titles since, including ''[[The Immortal Iron Fist]]'', which expanded on his origin story and the history of the Iron Fist.

Iron Fist has been adapted to appear in several animated television series and video games. [[Finn Jones]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] live-action television series ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', and the [[Luke Cage (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]''.

==Publication history==
[[Image:Amazing-Man Comics 5 page 05.jpg|thumb|[[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|Amazing-Man]] in ''Amazing-Man Comics'' #5 (Sept. 1939). Art by Bill Everett]]
Iron Fist, along with the previously-created [[Shang-Chi|Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu]], came from [[Marvel Comics]] during an American [[popular culture|pop culture]] trend in the early to mid-1970s of [[martial arts]] heroes. Writer/co-creator [[Roy Thomas]] wrote in a text piece in ''Marvel Premiere'' #15 that Iron Fist's origin and creation owe much to the [[Bill Everett]] character, [[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|John Aman, the Amazing-Man]], created in 1939. Thomas later wrote that he and artist/co-creator [[Gil Kane]] had

{{quote|...started "Iron Fist" because I'd seen my first [[kung fu]] movie, even before a [[Bruce Lee]] one came out, and it had a thing called "the ceremony of the Iron Fist" in it. I thought that was a good name, and we already had ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung Fu]]'' going, but I thought, "Maybe a superhero called Iron Fist, even though we had [[Iron Man]], would be a good idea." [Publisher] Stan [Lee] liked the name, so I got hold of Gil and he brought in his Amazing Man influences, and we designed the character together...<ref>{{Cite journal | journal=[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]] | issue=70 | date=July 2007| title=Roy Thomas interview | page=38}}</ref>}}

Debuting in a story written by Thomas and [[pencilled]] by Kane in the umbrella title ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #15–25 (May 1974 – October 1975), he was then written successively by [[Len Wein]], [[Doug Moench]], [[Tony Isabella]], and [[Chris Claremont]], with art by successive pencillers [[Larry Hama]], [[Arvell Jones]], [[Pat Broderick]], and, in some of his earliest professional work, [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. As the ''Marvel Premiere'' issues had successfully established a considerable readership for the character,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brennaman|first=Chris |title=Marvel Premiere|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=25 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> following this run, Iron Fist was immediately spun off into the solo series ''Iron Fist'', which ran 15 issues (November 1975 – September 1977). The solo series was written by Claremont and pencilled by Byrne. A subplot involving the [[Steel Serpent]] left unresolved by the cancellation of the series was wrapped up in issues #63–64 of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]''.

To rescue the character from cancellation, Marvel paired Iron Fist with another character who was no longer popular enough to sustain his own series, [[Luke Cage]].<ref name="back45">{{cite journal |last=Callahan |first=Timothy |date=December 2010 |title=Power Man and Iron Fist |journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=45 |pages= 3–11 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The two characters were partnered in a three-part story in Cage's series ''Power Man'' #48–50. The title of the series changed to ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' with issue #50 (April 1978), although the [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]] did not reflect this change until issue #67. Iron Fist co-starred in the series until the final issue (#125, September 1986), in which he is killed. Writer Jim Owsley (subsequently known as [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]]) later commented, "Fist's death was senseless and shocking and completely unforeseen. It took the readers' heads clean off. And, to this day, people are mad about it. Forgetting, it seems, that (a) you were supposed to be mad, that death is senseless and Fist's death was supposed to be senseless, or that (b) this is a comic book."<ref name="back45"/>

Iron Fist was revived half a decade later in ''[[Namor, the Sub-Mariner]]'' #21–25 (December 1991 – April 1992), a story which revealed that the character killed in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125 was a [[doppelganger]]. The story was both written and drawn by Byrne, who found the manner of Iron Fist's death objectionable and later commented, "In one of those amazing examples of Marvel serendipity, it turned out to be fairly easy not only to resurrect Danny, but to make it seem like that was the plan all along."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lantz|first=James Heath |title=Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner: Scion of the Deep or Royal Pain?|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=91|pages=57–58 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Iron Fist then became a frequently starring character in the anthology series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', featuring in three multi-part [[story arc]]s and four one-shot stories in 1992 and 1993. Two solo [[miniseries]] followed: ''Iron Fist'' (vol. 2) #1–2 (September–October 1996), by writer [[James Felder]] and penciller Robert Brown; and ''Iron Fist'' (vol. 3) #1–3 (July–September 1998), by writer [[Dan Jurgens]] and penciller [[Jackson Guice]]. Also around this time, he was among the ensemble of the group series ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' which ran 19 issues (July 1997 – January 1999).

Following a four-issue miniseries by writer [[Jay Faerber]] and penciller [[Jamal Igle]], ''Iron Fist: Wolverine'' (November 2000 – February 2001), co-starring the [[X-Men]] character [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and cover-billed as ''Iron Fist/Wolverine: The Return of K'un Lun'', came another solo miniseries, ''Iron Fist'' vol. 4 #1–6 (May–October 2004), by writer [[Jim Mullaney]] and penciller Kevin Lau. The first issue of a new ongoing series, ''[[The Immortal Iron Fist]]'', by co-writers [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Matt Fraction]] and primary artist [[David Aja]], premiered with a January 2007 cover-date. [[Duane Swierczynski]] took over the series from issue #17.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080709-IronFistDS.html | title=Readying Iron Fist with Writer Duane Swierczynski | publisher=[[Newsarama]] | date=September 7, 2008}}</ref>

Iron Fist's appearances outside his own title include three Iron Fist stories in Marvel's black-and-white comics magazine ''[[The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]'' #10 (March 1975), an additional story co-starring the [[Sons of the Tiger]] in issue #18 (November 1975), and a six-part serial, "The Living Weapon", in #19–24 (December 1975 – May 1976). He made guest appearances in such titles as ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'', ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', the Submariner series ''Namor'', ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'', and ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''.

Iron Fist appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 ''New Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue, #34 (January 2013). In 2014 Iron Fist was given new life and set to star in a new 12-issue comic book series written and drawn by [[Kaare Andrews]] titled ''Iron Fist: The Living Weapon'' as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!#All-New Marvel NOW!|All-New Marvel NOW!]]'' event.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=50154</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Background===
Danny Rand was born in New York City. His father, [[Wendell Rand]], as a young boy happened upon the mystical city of [[K'un-L'un]]. During his time in K'un-L'un, Wendell saved the life of the city's ruler, Lord Tuan, and was adopted as Tuan's son. However, Wendell eventually left K'un-L'un and became a wealthy entrepreneur in the United States. He married socialite [[Heather Rand|Heather Duncan]] and had a child: Daniel.

Wendell later organizes an expedition to again seek out K'un-L'un, taking his wife Heather, his business partner [[Harold Meachum]] and nine-year-old Danny. During the journey up the mountain, Danny slips off the path, his tie-rope taking his mother and father with him. Meachum, who also loves Heather, forces Wendell to plunge to his death but offers to rescue Heather and Danny. She rejects his help. Heather and Danny come across a makeshift bridge that appears out of nowhere and are attacked by a pack of wolves. Heather throws herself on the wolves to save Danny and is killed even as archers from K'un-L'un attempt to save her. The archers take the grieving Danny to see [[Yu-Ti|Yü-Ti]], the hooded ruler of K'un-L'un. When Danny expresses his desire for vengeance, Yü-Ti apprentices him to [[Lei Kung (comics)|Lei Kung]] the Thunderer, who teaches him martial arts.

Danny proves to be the most gifted of Lei Kung's students. He toughens his fists by plunging them into buckets of sand, gravel, and rock. At 19, Danny is given the chance to attain the power of the Iron Fist by fighting and defeating the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] [[Shou-Lao|Shou-Lao the Undying]], who guards the molten heart that had been torn from its body. Guessing that the heart provides life energy to Shou-Lao through the dragon-shaped scar on its chest, Danny covers the scar with his own body and hangs on until Shou-Lao collapses and dies, in the process burning a dragon brand into his own chest. Having killed Shou-Lao, he enters its cave and plunges his fists into a brazier containing the creature's molten heart, emerging with the power of the Iron Fist. It is later revealed that Danny is part of a long lineage of Iron Fists.

When K'un-L'un reappears on Earth after 10 years, Danny leaves to find his father's killer. Returning to New York, Danny Rand, dressed in the ceremonial garb of the Iron Fist, seeks out Harold Meachum, now head of Meachum Industries. After overcoming a number of attempts on his life, he confronts Meachum in his office, only to find the man legless&mdash;an amputation carried out when, after abandoning Danny and his mother, he was caught in heavy snow and his legs became frostbitten.

Meachum accepts his fate and tells Iron Fist to kill him. Overcome with pity, Iron Fist walks away. At that moment Meachum is murdered by a mysterious ninja, and his daughter Joy blames Iron Fist for the death.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #15-18</ref> Eventually, Iron Fist clears his name and begins a career as a superhero, aided by his friends [[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #21</ref> Notable adversaries in his early career include [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], the mysterious [[Master Khan]] (whom the ninja that killed Meachum once served), and the [[Steel Serpent]], the exiled son of Lei Kung, who coveted the Iron Fist power.

===Heroes for Hire===
While working undercover, Misty Knight infiltrates the organization of crime lord [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#John McIver|John Bushmaster]]. When Bushmaster discovers Knight's treachery, he kidnaps [[Claire Temple]] and Noah Burstein, close associates of [[Luke Cage]], better known as Power Man, and holds them hostage to force Cage to eliminate Knight. Iron Fist is on hand to stop him, however, and after a battle, the truth comes out. Rand helps Cage and the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] (Knight and Wing) battle Bushmaster, rescue Temple and Burstein, and obtain evidence that proves Cage's innocence of prior drug charges. Afterwards, Iron Fist and Power Man become partners, forming [[Heroes for Hire]], Inc.<ref>''Power Man'' #48-50</ref>

Iron Fist, in his [[secret identity]] of Danny Rand, resumes control of his parents' fortune as half of Rand-Meachum, Inc., making him quite wealthy.{{issue|date=March 2014}} This causes tension between Rand and Cage, who was raised poor.

Power Man and Iron Fist's partnership ends with Rand contracting cancer and being kidnapped as part of a plot masterminded by [[Master Khan]]. Just prior to a battle with the Black Dragon Chiantang (the brother of the mythical Dragon King), Danny is replaced by a [[doppelgänger]] created by the extra-dimensional [[H'ylthri]].<ref>behind the scenes in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #120</ref>  The double (who wears a red variant of the Iron Fist costume) is killed by Captain Hero a short time later. Cage, now the prime suspect in Rand's apparent death, becomes a fugitive.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125</ref>

===Resurrection===
While in stasis in K'un-L'un with the H'ylthri, Iron Fist manages to focus his ''chi'', curing the cancer. He is later freed from stasis by [[Namor]].<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #22-24</ref>

Rand and Cage reform Heroes for Hire, Inc. with an expanded team, this time working for Namor's Oracle Corporation. Namor ultimately dissolves Oracle as well as Heroes for Hire, Inc.

Iron Fist later loses his powers to [[Junzo Muto]],<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol. 2) #8-10</ref> the young leader of the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], and subsequently becomes the guardian of a pack of displaced dragons in Tokyo.<ref>''Iron Fist/Wolverine'' #1-4</ref> His powers are eventually restored by Chiantang, who brainwashes Iron Fist and forces him to battle [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. Black Panther is able to free Iron Fist from the creature's control, and the two work together to defeat the Black Dragon in [[Wakanda]].<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol. 2) #38-40</ref>

In the ''Iron Fist'' miniseries, [[Miranda Rand|Miranda Rand-K'ai]] also returns from the dead. The H'ylthri revive her and promise to restore her to full life if she retrieves the extra-dimensional artifact known as the Zodiac Key. To this end, she takes the identity of Death Sting, bringing her into conflict with Iron Fist as well as with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] When the H'ylthri try to kill Iron Fist, Miranda turns the power of the Zodiac Key against them, seemingly killing herself in the process. However, exposure to chemicals from the H'ylthri pods prevented her death.

===Posing as Daredevil===

===''The Immortal Iron Fist''===
{{Main|The Immortal Iron Fist}}

Orson Randall, Danny Rand's immediate predecessor, seeks out Danny Rand in New York and gives him The Book of the Iron Fist, a sacred ledger supposedly containing all the kung fu secrets of previous Iron Fists, which Randall claims will be necessary if Rand is to compete successfully in the coming tournament of the Seven Champions.{{issue|date=July 2014}} The [[Steel Serpent]], whose powers have been greatly augmented by the [[Crane Mother]], dispatches Randall. On the brink of death, Randall surrenders his ''chi'' to Rand, giving him sufficient power to battle the Serpent to a standstill.{{issue|date=July 2014}} After the battle, Rand is summoned by his master, Lei Kung (who is also the father of Steel Serpent) to compete in a tournament that will decide the cycle according to which each of the Seven Cities of Heaven appears on Earth.{{issue|date=July 2014}} However, the leaders of the Seven Cities had secretly erected gateways between Earth and each city without the knowledge of the populace. The corruption of the leaders of the Seven Cities of Heaven spurs Iron Fist, Lei Kung, Orson Randall's daughter, and [[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|John Aman]] to plan a revolution.{{issue|date=July 2014}} Iron Fist discovers that Crane Mother and Xao, a high-ranking HYDRA operative, are planning to destroy K'un Lun by using a portal. Upon learning of the plot, Steel Serpent helps Rand and the other Immortal Weapons defeat Xao.{{issue|date=July 2014}}

Rand destroys the train intended to destroy [[K'un-L'un]] by extending his ''chi'' to find the train's electromagnetic field. Meanwhile, the revolution orchestrated by Lei Kung and Orson's daughter proves successful, with Nu-an, the Yu-Ti of K'un Lun fleeing in terror. When Rand confronts Xao, Xao reveals that there is an eighth city of Heaven before killing himself. Rand suggests Lei Kung as the new Yu-Ti, with Orson's unnamed daughter as the new Thunderer.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #13</ref>

After learning that the Randall fortune that started Rand International was formed from the oppression of the Cities of Heaven, Rand decides to transform the company into a non-profit organization, dedicated to helping the poor. He also sets up the Thunder Dojo in Harlem to help inner-city children, buys back the old Heroes for Hire building as the new Rand International Headquarters and his new home, while offering Luke Cage a position at the company. He also tries to reconnect with Misty Knight. Rand, on his 33rd birthday, learns every single one of the previous Iron Fists died at the age of 33, except Orson Randall, who vanished at that time.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #16</ref>

Soon afterward, Rand is attacked and defeated by Zhou Cheng, a servant of Ch'l-Lin, who claims to have killed the Iron Fists in order to enter K'un Lun and devour the egg that births the next incarnation of Shou-Lao the Undying every generation, thus wiping out K'un Lun's Iron Fist legacy. Luke, Misty, and Colleen arrive and save Rand. Rand has his shoulder dislocated during a second battle with Cheng, but manages to defeat Cheng even in his weakened state. Following the duel, the Immortal Weapons, Luke, Colleen, and Misty arrive, and reveal to Rand that they have discovered a map in Cheng's apartment that leads to the Eighth City of Heaven. Rand and the others realize that this is where Ch'l-Lin originated, and depart for the Eighth City.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #20</ref>

In the Eighth City, he meets Quan Yaozu, the first Iron Fist, who became disillusioned with K'un Lun and rose up to rule the Eighth City as Changming. Rand and Fat Cobra manage to defeat Quan.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #25</ref> Rand's actions during their battles impress Quan, who decides that Rand may be living proof that K'un Lun is not the corrupt city it once was. Rand and Davos agree to guide Quan to K'un Lun and arrange a meeting between him and Lei-Kung to give Quan a forum for his grievances.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #26</ref>

However, when Rand returns to New York, he finds a HYDRA cell waiting for him at Rand International, seeking retribution for the death of Xao, and holding Misty hostage. In the ensuing battle, Rand International is destroyed, but Rand and Misty escape unharmed. Now left with only a fraction of his former net worth, Rand and Misty purchase a new condo in Harlem, and Rand decides to focus all of his attention and remaining resources at the Thunder Dojo. While moving into their new home, Rand asks Misty to marry him. Initially skeptical of the offer, Misty accepts and reveals that she is pregnant with Rand's child.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #27</ref>

===Avengers reform===
In the aftermath of ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'', Rand joins the newly-reformed New Avengers.<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #1</ref> After finding out that Misty's pregnancy was false, Misty and Danny decide to move out of their apartment and live separately, but continue their relationship.<ref>''I Am an Avenger'' #1</ref>

Danny later has an encounter with someone who is going by the name of Power Man. He and Luke Cage discover that the Power Man is Victor Alvarez, a survivor of a building that [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] blew up.<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #1</ref> Iron Fist becomes the new Power Man's mentor and the two become a team.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Iron Fist and the Immortal Weapons are summoned to [[Beijing]] to close the gates of the Eighth City that are on the verge of opening. However, Danny is placed under mind control which creates a mystical interference with the ability of the Immortal Weapons to close the gate. He is then forced to battle his allies. Thanks to War Machine knocking him out, the mission is completed successfully. However, Doctor Strange realizes that Iron Fist is now an Immortal Weapon of Agamotto.<ref>''Iron Man 2.0'' #6-7</ref>

During the "[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]" storyline, Iron Fist and Lei Kung bring [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] to K'un Lun to train as an Iron Fist, in order to defeat the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]]-possessed [[X-Men]].<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #11</ref>

===''Marvel NOW!''===
In the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' era, Iron Fist joins [[Luke Cage]] as the Heroes For Hire, having been employed by [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] to arrest his former colleagues in the [[Sinister Six]].<ref>''Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #3</ref>

They, alongside Cloak and Dagger, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Woman, fought the Army of Evil during Hydra's rise to power where they were defeated by Nitro. Iron Fist and those with him were trapped in the [[Darkforce]] dome by [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]] when his powers were enhanced by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] using the [[Darkhold]].<ref>''Secret Empire'' #0</ref>

During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Iron Fist babysat Danielle Cage while Luke and Jessica were away helping Iron Man and Spider-Man look for Wolverine's body after it went missing from its private resting place. After the mission was over, Luke and Jessica thanked Iron Fist for babysitting Danielle.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: The Adamantium Agenda'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Plunging his fists into the molten heart of the dragon Shou-Lao the Undying infused the dragon's superhuman energy into Rand. This, along with being trained by Lei Kung the Thunderer, gave Rand the power of the Iron Fist, allowing him to summon and focus his ''[[Qi|chi]]'' energy (also called natural energy or life force energy) to enhance his natural abilities to extraordinary levels. His strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, reflexes and senses can all be greatly intensified.

He is able to concentrate his own ''chi'' and the superhuman energy from Shou-Lao's heart into his hand, with it manifesting as a supernatural glow around his hand and fist. So concentrated, this "iron fist" can strike with superhuman hardness and impact, while his hand becomes impervious to pain and injury. However, summoning the power required by this feat leaves Rand physically and mentally drained, unable to repeat the act for a time, as long as an entire day in certain instances, though after years of using the ability, it has become less draining.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

He can focus his ''chi'' inward to heal himself or outward to heal others of injury, as well as to give himself [[psychic]] senses and to [[telepathy|telepathically]] fuse his consciousness with another person.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #37</ref>

Rand is also a skilled acrobat, gymnast, and a master of all of K'un Lun's martial arts, as well as various fighting styles from Earth, including [[Shaolin Kung Fu]], [[Aikido]],<ref>''Iron Fist'' (vol. 1) #15 (September 1977)</ref> [[Fujian White Crane]],<ref name=IronFistMartialArts1>''Iron Fist'' (vol. 2) #2 (October 1996)</ref> [[Judo]],<ref name=IronFistMartialArts2>''Marvel Team-Up'' (vol. 1) #63 (November 1977)</ref> [[Karate]],<ref name=IronFistMartialArts2 /> [[Muay Thai]],<ref name=IronFistMartialArts1 /> [[Ninjutsu]]<ref>''Iron Fist'' (vol. 1) #12 (April 1977)</ref> and [[Wing Chun]].<ref>''Iron Fist'' (vol. 2) #1 (September 1996)</ref>

This section lists the other people who have been called Iron Fist:

===Fongji===
Centuries ago, the Yu-Ti Nu-An had a recurring dream associating a red-haired girl with the Phoenix and a dragon. He later finds a matching red-haired girl named Fongji in the streets of K'un-L'un and has her trained as the Iron Fist.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Bendis, Brian Michael |artist=Deodato Jr., Mike; Conrad, Will |colorist=Beredo, Rain |story= |title=New Avengers |volume=2 |issue=25 |date=April 2012 |publisher=Marvel Comics |id=}}</ref> Nu-An asks for [[Cultural depictions of Leonardo da Vinci#Comics and graphic novels|Leonardo da Vinci]] to come to K'un-L'un in order to help protect the world against the Phoenix's arrival; meanwhile, Fongji is submitted to a hard training, eventually manifesting the Phoenix powers.

===Fan Fei===
In 1,000,000 BC, a K'un-Lun native named Fan Fei was born to the Green Lotus House and had taken a fascination with the [[Caveman|cavemen]] that lived outside K'un-Lun; going so far as to train a few of them in secret. After she was exposed, Fan Fei was chained up and forced to watch as her students were fed to Shou-Lou by Lei Kung. When she broke out, in the hopes that she will die fighting Shou-Lou, Fan Fei punched the dragon in his chest tattoo and gained his powers. Lei Kung had Fan Fei exiled from K'un-Lun, believing Shou-Lou was dead, and she traveled the world; fighting Deviants and the Gorgilla Clan of Man-Apes along the way. Fan Fei was approached by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who wanted her to use her powers to conquer Earth, but she declined. In response, Mephisto granted his gifts to the Gorgilla Clan. After a fight with Fan Fei, Mephisto led the Gorgilla Clan's Ape King to the Power Infinity Gem, which he used to fight Fan Fei again. After recuperating, Fan Fei found herself at the entrance of K'un-Lun. Lei Kung states that her sentencing was wrong, as they learned Shou-Lou was immortal, and wanted to bring her home. However, she declined, stating that Earth was her home and her fights here are just the beginning.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fan Fei later banded together with [[Agamotto]], [[Phoenix Force (comics)#Lady Phoenix|Lady Phoenix]], [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], and Stone Age versions of [[Black Panther (comics)#Black Panther 1,000,000 B.C.|Black Panther]], [[Ghost Rider#1,000,000 B.C. version|Ghost Rider]], and [[Star Brand#1,000,000 B.C. version|Star Brand]] to fought off a Celestial named the Fallen. They would go on to defeat it and seal it underground in what would later become South Africa.<ref>''Marvel Legacy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
===''MC2''===
Iron Fist appeared in the pages of ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' #24, in which he is retired after the death of Misty Knight (his wife in this universe). However, he temporarily steps back into costume to aid Spider-Girl against the might of Dragon Fist.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #24</ref>

After Dracula is repelled, Iron Fist plans to go after Dracula and keep him from reaching the Battleworld location where more symbiotes are dwelling.
