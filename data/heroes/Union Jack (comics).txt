==Fictional character biography==
===James Montgomery Falsworth===
A peer of the realm as Lord Falsworth, James Montgomery Falsworth is first active as the adventurer and British government operative Union Jack during [[World War I]]. During his adventures as a member of [[Freedom's Five]], he encounters the mysterious [[Baron Blood (comics)|Baron Blood]], a [[Vampires (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] [[saboteur]] for the Germans. After the war, Lord Falsworth retires to his ancestral home in England to raise a family.<ref>''Invaders'' vol. 1 #7</ref>

He is active again as Union Jack during [[World War II]]. He becomes a member of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] after the original [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Human Torch]] saves his daughter — Jacqueline Falsworth — from Baron Blood. Jacqueline is revived by a blood transfusion from the Human Torch which grants her the power of super-speed. As a result, she becomes the costumed hero [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] (a title she still holds in the 21st Century). After the attack, Lord Falsworth offers up his mansion as the Invaders' base of operations. After Baron Blood's attack on Jacqueline, James discovers the vampire is actually his brother, John. During a battle, Blood crushes Union Jack's legs under a boulder, effectively ending his career as a hero. Before the battle ends, James is able to impale Blood on a silver-veined stalagmite.<ref>''Invaders'' vol. 1 #7-9</ref> Soon after, he quits the Invaders.<ref>''Invaders'' vol. 1 #11</ref>

Although unable to use his legs, James later travels with Spitfire and [[Destroyer (Roger Aubrey)|Dyna-Mite]], parachuting into Nazi Germany. There they meet up with James' son, Brian, whom they were searching for. Falsworth and Dyna-Mite were captured by the Nazis, but are then rescued by Brian. Originally thinking his son a traitor, James learns that Brian fights against the Nazis as the costumed hero, the [[Destroyer (Timely Comics)|Destroyer]]. As a result, the two reconcile their differences and James passes the mantle of Union Jack on to Brian, at which point Brian abandons his Destroyer identity.<ref>''Invaders'' vol. 1 #18-21</ref> However, the father outlives the son when Brian is killed<ref name="ReferenceA">''Captain America'' vol. 1 #254, February 1981</ref> in an automobile accident in 1953.

Years later, James Montgomery Falsworth contacts [[Captain America]] to combat Baron Blood. Falsworth finally sees the end of Baron Blood with the help of Captain America and the third incarnation of Union Jack ([[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Joey Chapman]]). After this episode, James Montgomery Falsworth passes away from heart failure due to old age.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 1 #253-254 (January–February, 1980)</ref>

He is seen again when Baron Zemo travels back in time, in ''[[Baron Zemo#Born Better|Baron Zemo: Born Better]]'' #3.<ref>{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=89741|title=''Thunderbolts Presents: Zemo - Born Better''}}</ref>

===Brian Falsworth===
Brian Falsworth is the son of James Montgomery Falsworth, born like his father in Falsworth Manor in a village north of [[London]]. Initially, Brian and his friend Roger are sympathetic toward [[Germany]] and supportive of peace between it and the United Kingdom. Toward the end of the 1930s, the pair go into Germany, but quickly discover the evil nature of the [[Nazi]] regime. Brian is thrown in prison, and Roger is given to German scientists.

Brian gains superpowers through the help of a German scientist who tries to recreate the Super Soldier Formula that resulted in [[Captain America]]. Brian escapes prison and becomes a costumed Nazi-fighter within Germany, calling himself the [[Destroyer (Golden Age)|Destroyer]].

Meanwhile, Roger is used for experiments. He is brainwashed and his body is reduced in size.  Standing one foot tall but with the strength of a full-sized man, he is given the name ''[[Dyna-Mite]]''. With his memory gone, the Nazis unleash Dyna-Mite against the Allies, in a plot which involves the [[Crusaders (Marvel Comics)|Crusaders]].

Meanwhile, Brian, reunited with his family and reconciling with his father, investigates the past of Dyna-Mite. Brian ultimately finds out the truth behind Dyna-Mite, and Roger's size and memory are restored. After his father's legs are crushed by [[Baron Blood (comics)|Baron Blood]], Brian learns of his father's costumed identity as Union Jack. Alongside [[Captain America]], Brian battled Nazi soldiers, and rescued Lord Falsworth and Dyna-Mite when they sought him out in Germany and were captured by the Nazis. Brian adopted the Union Jack identity as an adventurer and British government operative in place of his father, joining the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] and battling [[Master Man (comics)|Master Man]].<ref>''Invaders'' #18-21</ref> Roger, in turn, takes on the mantle of the [[Destroyer (Golden Age)|Destroyer]].<ref>''Invaders'' vol. 1 #26</ref>

Later, Brian is charged by magical lightning when fighting [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He gains the ability to shoot electricity from his fingertips.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Following the war, Brian remains active as Union Jack,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and is instrumental in founding the [[V-Battalion]] alongside Roger Aubrey and other heroes of the era.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} A car crash<ref name="ReferenceB">''Citizen V and the V Battalion'' vol. 2 #1 (March 2002)</ref> on a British road in 1953<ref name="ReferenceA"/> abruptly ended Brian Falsworth's career and his life.

===Joseph Chapman===
{{Main article|Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)}}

Joseph Chapman's incarnation as the current Union Jack is unique in that he is not a member of the Falsworth line or part of any British aristocratic family. Rather, Joey Chapman, born in [[Manchester]], England, is the working class son of a shipbuilder.

Chapman becomes Union Jack when, while visiting Falsworth Manor with his friend, Kenneth Crichton (nephew of Brian Falsworth and later Baron Blood III), he dons the costume to stand in for Kenneth and save the life of James Montgomery Falsworth, Lord Falsworth, who has been targeted by [[Baron Blood (comics)|Baron Blood]].

For a time he fought crime on his own, serving as a hero for the common man as opposed to the aristocratic [[Captain Britain]]. Their rivalry was most apparent when they both were chosen as Knights of Pendragon by the Green Knight of Avalon. Captain Britain did not remain a Pendragon for long, but Union Jack stuck with the new team until it broke up when half the team traveled to a parallel world to offer humanitarian aid. During his time with the ''KoP'', Union Jack's physique increased to near Hulk-like proportions and he went through a series of alternate costumes. After the ''Knights of Pendragon'' break up and his enhanced musculature returns to normal, he reverts to the classic uniform and returns to fighting crime solo. He also faces a vampire cult led by a vampire who had been created by the original Baron Blood.

Chapman later wears an updated, militaristic costume, and joins the modern incarnation of the [[Invaders (comics)#2004–2005|Invaders]], led by Jim Hammond, the original [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Human Torch]]. For a time, Chapman became romantically involved with his New Invaders team mate, [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] (Kenneth's mother). They have since resolved to be friends, and he remains active in the UK's espionage community.

==Powers and abilities==
James Montgomery Falsworth was an athletic man who possessed no superhuman powers. However, he was trained in the field of espionage, a veteran of two world wars, and highly trained in armed and unarmed combat. He wore a bullet-proof costume and carried a 6-inch dagger and a [[Webley revolver|Webley]] .455 revolver, both of which he used with great skill. Falsworth began using a wheelchair in 1942 and was debilitated by extreme old age at the time of his death.

During his initial career as the second Union Jack, Brian Falsworth possessed no superhuman powers. He was a superbly athletic man, but, having been exposed to a variant of the Super Soldier Formula, was enhanced to the peak of human potential, and was highly trained in armed and unarmed combat. Like his father, he wore bulletproof fabric and primarily used a Webley .455 revolver and a 6-inch dagger. After an encounter with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] later in his career, he gained the ability to discharge bolts of mystic lightning from his fingertips after his body was energized by a lightning strike.<ref>''Invaders'' vol. 1 #32-33</ref>

Like those who held the title of Union Jack before him, Joey Chapman is an athlete in peak physical condition. In addition, his strength, speed, and stamina are enhanced by the Power of the [[Knights of Pendragon|Pendragon]]. Chapman usually carries a handgun of some variety (changing it as appropriate to the mission) and a silver-edged dagger used for supernatural foes.
