'''John Jonah Jameson III''' (also known as '''Colonel Jupiter''', '''Man-Wolf''' and '''Stargod''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the son of [[J. Jonah Jameson]].

==Publication history==
John Jameson debuted in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #1 (March 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref name="Manning18">{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 18|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= [''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1] introduced readers to ''The Daily Bugle'' publisher and anti-Spider-Man activist J. Jonah Jameson, as Spidey saved his astronaut son, John, from a space mission gone awry.}}</ref> This first story introduces the character as a prominent [[astronaut]].

During his lengthy stint on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' during the 1970s, writer [[Gerry Conway]] had Jameson turned into a [[werewolf]], with the new alias "Man-Wolf". Conway explained: {{quote|I'd wanted to do something with [John Jameson] for a long time. I felt like he was a character who'd gotten lost over the years. Also, at this point, it's 1973, John Jameson is an astronaut, and [[Apollo 11|we've been to the moon]], so I asked myself, "What would we do with that in Spider-Man's world?" And that was how it played out. It also added another layer of tension to Spider-Man's relationship with J. Jonah Jameson. As a writer, you always want to find a way to increase the pressure on the main character, to increase the involvement of other characters with that character. Consequently, anything that could make Jonah's hatred of Spider-Man more intense and at the same time more understandable was a useful device dramatically.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #44| page= 10|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}} As the Man-Wolf, Jameson was the lead feature in ''[[Creatures on the Loose]]'' #30 (July 1974) to #37 (September 1975).<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 75: "Man-Wolf was awarded his own regular spotlight in the ongoing title ''Creatures on the Loose''...Man-Wolf's adventures became the focus of this title until its conclusion with issue #37."</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[New York City]], John Jonah Jameson III is the son of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' irascible, gruff publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Jonah is immensely proud of his son, whom he sees as a true hero. Initially an astronaut, he was first seen being saved by [[Spider-Man]] when his craft malfunctioned on re-entry,<ref name="Manning18" /> something that did nothing to endear the wall-crawler to his father resenting Spider-Man's form of heroism.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1 (March 1963). Marvel Comics.</ref>

On a later mission, Jameson was infected with spores that gave him super-strength, but strained his body and mind. He was forced to wear a strength-restraining Jupiter suit and battled Spider-Man at his father's urging before recovering and calling himself "Colonel Jupiter". His father convinced him to go after Spider-Man who had been seen apparently robbing a bank. The web-slinger outsmarted him, and Jonah soon learned that Spider-Man was saving the bank from a bomb. However, John did not care about the misunderstanding and was really out for revenge. Spider-Man managed to neutralize the spores with electricity, returning Jameson to normal.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #41-42. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>Manning "1960s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 37: "Spider-Man tangled with a powered-up John Jameson, driven half-mad by contact with spores encountered on a space walk."</ref>

While he was on the moon, Jameson found the mystical Godstone, an other-dimensional [[ruby]]. The jewel grafted itself to his throat and extended tendrils through his body. Moonlight activated the gem, which transformed him into the [[Werewolf|lycanthropic]] "Man-Wolf",<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]]|penciller= [[Gil Kane|Kane, Gil]]|inker= [[John Romita, Sr.|Romita, Sr., John]]; [[Tony Mortellaro|Mortellaro, Tony]]|story= The Mark of the Man-Wolf|title= The Amazing Spider-Man|issue= #124|date= September 1973}}</ref> and he fought Spider-Man in this bestial form.<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 70: "The Man-Wolf, a major new threat to Spider-Man and his supporting cast, was introduced in a two-part tale that saw the werewolf terrorize J.

Later, he was transported to the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|dimension]] known as Other Realm, from which the ruby originated and the source of the radiation that transforms John into the Man-Wolf. It was revealed that the ruby was created by the dying Stargod to pass on his powers. While on Earth, Jameson could only partially transform, resulting in his berserk behavior.<ref>''[[Tower of Shadows#Creatures on the Loose|Creatures on the Loose]]'' #30-37 and ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #36-3. Marvel Comics.7</ref> While in the Other Realm he could fully transform, resulting in retention of his human consciousness while in lupine form. He took up the "Stargod" mantle, and acted as champion of the Other Realm, and gained new powers such as [[telepathy]] and energy manipulation. He fought his foes with a sword, dagger and longbow in this incarnation.<ref>''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #45-46 and ''[[The Savage She-Hulk]]'' 13-14. Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterward, he opted to return to Earth, resulting in him losing the ability to fully transform and the loss of all memories of being the Stargod. He later allowed himself to be subjected to a procedure that removed the ruby, restoring normalcy for some time.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[David Anthony Kraft|Kraft, David Anthony]]|penciller= [[James Sherman (comics)|Sherman, James]]; [[Alan Weiss (comics)|Weiss, Alan]]|inker= [[Steve Mitchell (comics)|Mitchell, Steve]]|story= Dark Side of the Moon|title= [[The Spectacular Spider-Man]] Annual|issue= #3|date= 1981}}</ref><ref>Manning "1980s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 121: "With the help of Dr. Curt Connors and Spider-Man, John was cured of his condition, seemingly forever."</ref>

Jameson became the pilot of [[Captain America]]'s personal [[Quinjet]] for a period, using the call-sign "Skywolf".{{issue|date=June 2012}} During this time, he was temporarily transformed into Man-Wolf by [[Dredmund the Druid|Dredmond Druid]] wanting the power of the Stargod.{{issue|date=June 2012}} Jameson left Captain America's employ due to his attraction to [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] (Captain America's (then) girlfriend).{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Jameson remains friends with Spider-Man and often tries to convince his father to "let up on [Spider-Man]". He spent some time as Ravencroft's Head of Security and briefly dated its director Dr. [[Ashley Kafka]]. The [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] symbiote briefly overwhelmed Jameson, using him to commit further murders before Carnage eventually bonded with [[Ben Reilly]]-the Spider-Man at the time. Both John and Ashley were fired by a director angry about the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s escape and subsequent wounding by [[Kraven the Hunter]]. Via hypnotherapy, Kafka helped discover that [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] had caused him to attack his hospitalized father. This therapy also briefly unleashed John's Man-Wolf aspect before Ashley was able to help John suppress his changes once more.<ref name="Spider-Carnage">''Sensational Spider-Man'' #3, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #410, ''Spider-Man'' #67, and ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #233. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, John helped Captain America while the latter was in hiding. He was assisting She-Hulk in locating and signing up unregistered superheroes. John has also been registered as the Man-Wolf under the [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} During this time, the villain [[Stegron]] temporarily transformed him into the Man-Wolf again, as a side-effect of a mad scheme, to devolve the entire population of New York City. He attacked [[Mary Jane Watson]] and [[Aunt May|May Parker]] in the [[Avengers Tower]], but was subdued by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]] before he could harm them.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] subsequently cured him of this form.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>

John had been dating [[She-Hulk]] (Jennifer Walters) and the two had been living together for some time along with Augustus Pugliese (She-Hulk's coworker).<ref>''She-Hulk'' #5 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> Eventually they [[elope]]d in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #8 (2005).

Marvel Comics.</ref> He now retains his intelligence while in Man-Wolf form, has the Stargod's powers, and apparently can switch between human and lupine forms. His current superhuman status can be defined in his own words as "''I am a god''" and is supported by a battle with a clone of the Mad Titan [[Thanos]] in which he held his own.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #10 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, John does not want to be the Stargod because he feels that having powers makes him arrogant and savage. She-Hulk and Stargod separated after She-Hulk discovered that feelings for John were influenced prior to their marriage by [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]],<ref>''She-Hulk'' #11 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> and had learned that John had hoped to convince Jennifer to give up She-Hulk's powers permanently.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #12 (2005).

Marvel Comics.</ref>

When it came to Jameson's next mission into space, [[Alistair Smythe]], the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], and the new villain [[Fly-Girl]] attack the launch site with an army of cyborg minions (each one wanting revenge on J.J.J.) where the three sabotaged the launch and hold John for ransom.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #652</ref> John was saved.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Soon after, Jameson was attacked on the Apogee 1 Space Station by co-workers mind-controlled by [[Doctor Octopus]] wanting to take control of the station. With the help of Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]], he was able to save the day and the station safely crashed into the ocean, its employees alive and well.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #680-681. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
John Jameson is a skilled pilot and astronaut and is experienced in hand-to-hand combat and a variety of weapons. During his space flight to the gas giant called Jupiter, alien spores found on the planet had attracted too and clung on John on his return trip home.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #41. (Oct, 1966) Marvel Comics.</ref> These spores changed his anatomical physiology causing him to enlarge and become physically denser than normal, he also ran the risk of cardiovascular and neurological complications without use of a specially designed weighted suit which monitored his bio-readings. Also using his powers increased psychological instability, causing him to become increasingly more violent and aggressive whenever his emotions ran away with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #42. (Nov, 1966) Marvel Comics.</ref>

While Jameson was doing search and rescue missions in the Middle East, the American military discovered that another Godstone had grown within his body, the original having altered his physiology to the point that he now spawns replacement gems.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Gerry Conway|penciller = Mike Perkins|inker = Mike Perkins|colorist = Andy Troy|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Nick Lowe|story = The One That Got Away, Part Three|title = Carnage|volume = 2|issue = #3|date = 30 December 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> When the new Godstone is ripped out and crushed by Carnage, another immediately appears and heals Jameson.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Gerry Conway|penciller = Mike Perkins|inker = Mike Perkins|colorist = Andy Troy|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Nick Lowe|story = The One That Got Away, Part Five|title = Carnage|volume = 2|issue = #5|date = 17 January 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

===As Colonel Jupiter===

(2016) Marvel Comics.</ref> He was not a traditional werewolf and was invulnerable to silver.

===As Stargod=== 
While in the Other Realm, Stargod possessed both his human intellect and the Man-Wolf's body, as well as vast superhuman strength, a high degree of durability, and cosmic and telepathic powers. Jameson, eventually learning to utilize the Stargod power by force of will; could consciously change between human and wolf forms.

===What If?===

The death of his son makes Jonah Jameson re-think his relentless attitudes, and he subsequently dedicates the ''Daily Bugle'' to the promotion of superheroes, not their persecution.<ref>''What If?''

John ended up in the hospital following the crash-landing. When [[J. Jonah Jameson]] visits John in the hospital, John mentions [[Spider-Man]] fighting a guy in a rhino suit which proved that the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] was the one who robbed the shuttle. The [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] later abducted John from the hospital which draws Spider-Man and J.J.J. to an abandoned church. While Spider-Man fought Shocker, J.J.J. got his son away from the church. While still in a wheelchair following his abduction, John visited the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' where he was welcomed by its staff.

Jonah Jameson planned on writing an article on how John saved New York City by finding the Green Goblin's planted bomb, John warned this would lead to an investigation that would pull him from a coming space mission so his father reluctantly attributed John's actions to Spider-Man. Later, his spaceship malfunctions after being hit by an asteroid and nearly crashes (similar to ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #1) but John is able to safely land his ship, which contained the Venom symbiote. Jonah's anger that other newspapers which had Spider-Man's battle with the Goblin on the front page sold more than the ''Daily Bugle'', with John's survival as the front-page story, intensifying Jonah's hatred for the web-slinger to discredit even more. John is later revealed to have been exposed to alien spores (due to earlier contact with the symbiote) that have been making him bigger, heavier and stronger, causing [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] to design a special suit for him. When Venom impersonates Spider-Man, he is convinced to be the superhero Colonel Jupiter by his father. Venom attacked him, framing Spider-Man and causing the spores' effects on him to increase, leading Colonel Jupiter to fight Spider-Man. After a brutal fight, Spider-Man discovered that electricity could destroy John's spores. Upon being exposed to 2,000,000 volts of electricity, he returned to being physically normal. John ends up in Ravencroft still craving the spores' power.

John's construction crew found an advanced civilization's remains harboring a number of strange jewels. One of these jewels has embedded itself in John's chest and triggered his feral Man-Wolf transformation (with the trappings and the sword used by Stargod). Spider-Man manages to shatter the jewel, but the sudden reversion causes John to retain some wolfish features. John is kept in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody for treatment while J. Jonah Jameson blames Spider-Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. for his son's condition; [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] tells J.J.J. that his son is saved because of Spider-Man.

It took Spider-Man, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Gwen Stacy]] and Harry to undo the effects of the Man-Wolf transformations and cure the infected. While [[Norman Osborn]] is displeased that he got Harry involved upon being given the lunar crystal, John stated the Man-Wolf form had a different personality as Osborn plans to find a way to fix the lunar crystal's effects.
