'''Medusa''' ('''Medusalith Amaquelin-Boltagon''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Her name and character are derived from Greek mythology as her hair displays similar qualities to that of [[Medusa]] the [[Gorgon]]'s hair. Medusa has psychokinetic control over her hair, a power she obtained through [[Terrigenesis]]. Due to this, she is able to expand it to double its normal length, pick locks with it, remotely lift objects (both animate and inanimate), and she often uses it as a rope to contain objects and people.

[[Serinda Swan]] portrays Medusa in the character's live-action debut in the 2017 television series ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]''.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Medusa first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #36 (1965), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. She appears first in flashback, then in costume as part of the fledgling "Frightful Four". She appears in #38, 41, 42, 43, 44-48 and in various subplot glimpses from #49-62. The Inhumans also appear in ''Fantastic Four'' # 82-83, with Medusa. They are granted their first new adventure in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5, and a solo series in the split-book ''Amazing Adventures'' (volume 2) #1-10. The first four installments are written and drawn by Jack Kirby. The second four installments are written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by Neal Adams. That storyline flows into the ongoing "Kree-Skrull War" in the ''Avengers'' title #94-97.

Medusa has also figured prominently in the 12 part maxi-series ''The Inhumans'' by Jaye Lee in the 1990s.

Medusa appears in the new series ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' by [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Mike Allred]], which debuted in November 2012.<ref name="FantasticFour">{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/19200/marvel_now_qa_fantastic_four |title=Marvel NOW! Q&A: Fantastic Four |last=Beard |first=Jim |date=9 August 2012 |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref>

Beginning in May 2015, Medusa appeared as one of the main characters in ''[[A-Force]]'', an all-female [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] spin-off being launched by [[G. Willow Wilson]], Marguerite Bennett, and Jorge Molina during Marvel's ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' crossover.<ref name="Mashable">{{cite web |last=Dickey |first=Josh |date=2015-02-06 |title=Marvel assembles first all-female Avengers team, the 'A-Force'|url=http://mashable.com/2015/02/06/marvel-female-avengers-a-force/|publisher=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=2015-02-05}}</ref><ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/02/06/marvel-comics-a-force-female-avengers/22970157/</ref>

In 2017, Medusa appears in an early adventure with the Frightful Four, published as Avengers 1.1- 5.1 This five issue mini-series is positioned between ''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #16 & 17, as a side story when the evil team thinks they have killed the Fantastic Four (in ''Fantastic Four'' #38) but no one knows it. They publicly attack Captain America and his new team of replacements after their press conference to earn some "street cred". They are publicly beaten in a rematch in issue 4.1 but Medusa presumably flees before the team's final cameo in 5.1 where they are preparing a grave for her as a "traitor".

==Fictional character biography==
Medusa belongs to the race of [[Inhumans]], a species of prehistoric earthlings mutated by the [[Terrigen Mist]]s produced deep under the Inhuman city-state of [[Attilan]], presently located in the oxygen-rich [[Blue Area of the Moon]]. [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] (who later became the wife of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]) is Medusa's younger sister. Considered a member of Attilan's Royal Family, Medusa's parents chose to expose her to the Terrigen Mists when she was a child.

During her adolescent years Medusa would often visit her distant cousin [[Black Bolt]] during his confinement, and she learned to communicate with him through body language. During the course of these visits, the two fell in love and became engaged. She attended Black Bolt's release from his isolation cell at the age of eighteen, and witnessed the first confrontation between Black Bolt and his insane brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]].<ref>''Thor'' #149</ref> Maximus also claims to be in love with Medusa, and has made frequent attempts to usurp both the throne of Attilan as well as his brother's bride-to-be. It was in Maximus' first successful attempt to take the throne that Medusa was knocked off a sky-sled by the Trikon and afflicted with amnesia. She left Attilan, and wandered Europe as a thief.<ref>''Inhumans Special'' #1</ref>
{{Tone|section|date=August 2014}}
Still suffering from amnesia, Medusa joins super-villain team the [[Frightful Four]] and battles the Fantastic Four on three separate occasions.<ref>"Fantastic Four #36 (March 1965), 38 (May 1965) & 41-43 (Aug - Oct 1965)</ref>

She was then pursued by [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] on behalf of Maximus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #44</ref> Eventually Medusa regained her senses and rejoined forces with the Inhumans Royal Family on the run. She was reunited with Black Bolt, who had been searching for her, and returned to Attilan. However, she became trapped in Atillan by the "negative zone" barrier created by Maximus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45-48</ref> She was eventually freed from the barrier at great cost by Black Bolt, and left the Great Refuge to visit the outside world as an adventurer.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #59</ref> It was some time before the disastrous effects of worldly pollution on the Inhumans was known. She engages Spider-Man in his own title for an issue, being manipulated by the manufacturer/promoter of a line of shampoo products. She also has been re-abducted by the Frightful Four in an attempt to manipulate her.<ref>''Marvel Superheroes'' #15</ref> The Fantastic Four became friends and allies and aided the Inhumans on several occasions, such as during the frequent power struggles between Black Bolt and the deranged Maximus.

Medusa has been known to join the Fantastic Four as a full team member for brief periods of time. She became a temporary replacement for [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #130</ref> known as the Invisible Girl at that time, when on family leave, caring for her comatose son [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]. Through her relations with the Fantastic Four, Medusa and Black Bolt have sought to achieve an understanding and peace between the races of Earth and Attilan. Nevertheless, the Inhumans have been forced to relocate their home of Attilan several times due to continued human hostility.

Black Bolt would eventually become the king of the Inhumans upon the death of his parents. Medusa oversaw the moving of Attilan to the [[Blue Area of the Moon]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #240</ref> Alongside the Inhuman Royal Family, she battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] under Maximus's mind control.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #12</ref> Medusa and Black Bolt were then married and Medusa was made queen, becoming both royal consort and royal interpreter.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #18</ref> When Medusa became pregnant, Attilan's Genetics Council argued that the pregnancy should be terminated due to the possibility of the child inheriting Maximus' insanity coupled with Black Bolt's immense and destructive power. Medusa defied the Council and fled to Earth to avoid the compulsory abortion and live anonymously in the desert until the child was born, a son named [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]].<ref name="Inhumans Graphic Novel">''Marvel Graphic Novel: The Inhumans''</ref> Black Bolt reconciled with Medusa and the pair returned to Attilan and turned their infant son over to the Genetics Council. Following these events Ahura was not mentioned or seen in the Marvel Universe for several years.

Later, alongside the Inhumans and the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], she battled [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #67-68</ref> Alongside the Inhumans and Avengers, she also battled the Brethren.<ref>''Avengers'' #334-335</ref>

===Royalty===
Medusa's primary role among the Inhumans is as interpreter for her liege and husband, the silent but commanding Black Bolt. As such she is an experienced state figure within the quasi-feudal system of the Inhumans' government, and is used to speaking with awareness of regal issues of protocol and comportment. This imperial attitude is usually tempered by her strong sense of morality and fairness.<ref name="Inhumans Graphic Novel"/><ref>''Inhumans'' #6</ref>

Medusa is featured in the six issue series ''[[Beyond!]]''. She is kidnapped along with other famous and infamous superhumans to the artificial planet known as [[Battleworld]]. After witnessing [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] apparently murder [[Spider-Man]] - although it is later revealed to be the [[Space Phantom]] - Spider-Man apparently mistaking her for Mary Jane as he compliments her hair in his 'last moments', she passes royal judgement that he must undergo fifty lashes. She supersedes the authority of the Avenger's representative, [[Wasp (comics)|Janet Van Dyne]], and uses the control over her hair to create a whipping motion so fast that it produces miniature sonic booms, which Venom is especially vulnerable to. While Henry Pym tries to dissuade Medusa from continuing the punishment, Venom is able to stab Medusa through the thigh. Later on in the issue, Medusa saves the team during the sudden crash landing of their space vessel by absorbing the majority of the impact with her hair. As stated by Wasp, Medusa is the team's primary short-range offense. Eventually the team triumphs over the [[Beyonder]] and returns to Earth. At the end of the series, Medusa can be seen alongside Black Bolt attending the funeral of her ''Beyond!'' teammate [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]]. She gives Gravity's parents a precious statue, the highest honor amongst the Inhumans, in commemoration of Gravity's sacrifice.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

In ''[[I Heart Marvel]]'', Medusa stars and narrates in a one-shot vignette appearing in issue #3 of the ''Marvel Ai'' edition. Titled ''Silence of the Heart'', the story explores the relationship between Medusa and Black Bolt. Medusa explains that her husband's silence is a burden that she also bears. Black Bolt makes an appearance at this point and the two are shown to make love as Medusa contemplates her longing to hear a moan, whisper, or laugh from him.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

The title ''[[Son of M]]'' focuses on [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro Maximoff]] following the events of ''[[House of M]]''. After attempting to commit suicide, a dying Pietro is brought to Attilan by Crystal. While [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] protests, Medusa grants Pietro asylum in Attilan until he is fully recovered. Once healed, a depowered Pietro tries to convince Black Bolt and Medusa to allow him access to the Terrigen Mists, but Medusa firmly states that [[Terrigen Mists|Terrigenesis]] is a process forbidden to outsiders and that such a process upon a human could result in drastic mutations. Pietro manages to expose himself to the Mists regardless, and receives new powers before collecting both the Terrigen Crystals and his daughter, Luna, and returning to Earth. The crystals eventually end up in the possession of a black-ops sector of the United States government. The sector's subsequent refusal to return the crystals sparks a declaration of war between the Inhumans and the United States.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

During this title it is made reference that Black Bolt and Medusa are childless. Upon discovery that Luna has been taken to Earth by Pietro, Medusa advises Crystal that perhaps it is right that Pietro should spend time with his daughter. Crystal remarks that if Medusa had children of her own she might be able to understand how she felt over the matter. It is not apparent whether this is an example of Ahura's existence being retconned from the Marvel Universe, or if this is meant to be a sarcastic comment in reference to Ahura's supposed confinement.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

[[Image:Maximusmedusa.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Medusa and Maximus, by [[Frazer Irving]].]]

The events of ''[[Silent War]]'' immediately follow the events of ''Son of M''. The Silent War series reveals a growing rift between Medusa and Black Bolt as the two disagree on his decision to declare war against the United States for failing to relinquish the Terrigen Crystals. Medusa finds herself no longer able to interpret her husband's wishes as she used to. While Medusa is issuing Black Bolt's war declarations to the Inhumans council he becomes frustrated and snaps his fingers to silence her, indicating that she wasn't relating what he intended. Medusa later confides to Black Bolt that he had never treated her that way before, as if she were a dog, and Black Bolt responds apologetically.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Their son, Ahura, also reappears in this series as a mentally unstable adolescent. Medusa argues that Black Bolt seems not to care that their son is being kept in isolation, and advises him that despite his orders she has gone to visit Ahura in his cell on more than one occasion. Black Bolt is angered by this and becomes physically aggressive with Medusa, grabbing her face and mouth to silence her. In her growing confusion with her husband's actions, Medusa finds herself drawn to Maximus against her will and would visit him often in his prison cell. It is revealed by [[Luna (comics)|Luna]], Crystal's daughter, that Maximus had somehow implanted a "darkness" into Medusa's mind that was affecting her actions. Later on, Medusa and Maximus share a kiss as a distraught Black Bolt watches from the shadows. Medusa's thoughts at the time, however, reveal that she is not in control of her actions and that she only loves Black Bolt. The end of Silent War is left a cliffhanger with Black Bolt confined in prison, Ahura released, and Medusa now at Maximus' side as he assumes the throne of the Inhumans.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Due to inconsistencies with other Marvel titles featuring Black Bolt during this time, it is unclear when, and if, ''Silent War'' takes place in relation to [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|The Illuminati]], [[World War Hulk]], and [[Secret Invasion]] storylines.

Medusa appears alongside Black Bolt in issue #1 of the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' series. Medusa is seen with Black Bolt when [[Hulk]] attacks Attilan. She warns Hulk not to pursue a fight with her husband, as Black Bolt has defeated Hulk in past battles. The fight begins and Medusa is not shown to interfere or assist. Black Bolt is subsequently defeated by Hulk, though the battle is not shown beyond Black Bolt's opening attack and it is made unclear as to how Hulk managed to win the fight.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

It was revealed in ''[[New Avengers: Illuminati]]'' that Black Bolt had been replaced by a [[Skrull]] impostor for an unknown amount of time.<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #5</ref> The impostor revealed himself to the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] and was killed. Both the sudden rift between Medusa and Black Bolt apparent in ''Silent War'' and Black Bolt's later defeat at the hands of Hulk in ''World War Hulk'' could be attributed to this development, for it is uncertain just when Black Bolt might have been replaced by his Skrull duplicate.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

When the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' begins, the Inhumans part of the story, by ''[[Heroes (television)|Heroes]]'' writer Joe Pokaski, digs into how the Inhuman Royal Family deals with the news that the Black Bolt they knew was a Skrull impostor. Medusa is shown fighting a Skrull that not only possesses her powers, but also possesses the powers of Mister Fantastic.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #2</ref> Medusa heads into Kree space to get [[Ronan the Accuser]] to help look for the Skrull ship containing Black Bolt and her son.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3</ref> She succeeds in rescuing her family and returning to Attilan.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #4</ref>

During the ''[[War of Kings]]'' storyline, Medusa was with the Inhumans when they went into space and forged an alliance with the Kree and was also there when [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Lilandra Neramani]], and the rest of Havok's [[Starjammers]] requested asylum from [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] and his forces. When Maximus speaks out, Medusa pushes him aside. After Ronan is wounded in battle with Vulcan's forces, Medusa states to the Shi'ar that they had made a big mistake and vows that they will pay for this.<ref>''War of Kings'' #1</ref> Medusa does a broadcast on Black Bolt's behalf and tells the citizens of the Kree Empire that they have suffered an unprovoked assault by the forces of the Shi'ar. The shield that once protected their star system has fallen. During a discussion with the other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, Medusa states that Shi'ar blood will spill in the next fight while trying to keep the Kree in line.<ref>''War of Kings'' #2</ref> Medusa and Black Bolt approve of Maximus' idea to create a mechanism to help them in their fight against the Shi'ar.<ref>''War of Kings'' #3</ref> Medusa ends up devastated when the T-Bomb goes off with Black Bolt and Vulcan still where the T-Bomb was. While weeping in Crystal's arms, Medusa declared that they have won.<ref>''War of Kings'' #6</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Medusa was seen when Quicksilver appears in Attilan and present them with the Xerogen Crystals following the defeat of [[the Unspoken]]. Medusa then absolves him of his crimes and restores his citizenship.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #31</ref>

During the ''[[Realm of Kings]]'' storyline, Medusa ends up taking control of the Inhumans following Black Bolt's death. [[Devos the Devastator]] arrives and ends up inciting a riot in the [[Alpha Primitives]].<ref>''Realm of Kings: Inhumans'' #1</ref> [[The Mighty Avengers]] arrive and help to quell the riots incited by Devos the Devastator. Henry Pym learns from Medusa about what happened to Black Bolt and expresses his sorrow for her loss as he too had lost [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].<ref>''Realm of Kings: Inhumans'' #2</ref> Medusa and the rest of the Inhumans deal with Dr. Vere and Zarek when they plot to overthrow the Inhuman Royal Family.<ref>''Realm of Kings: Inhumans'' #3</ref>

She takes her husband's place in the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] when [[Iron Man]] reassembles the team in response to the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s attempts to acquire the [[Infinity Gems]],<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4, #8</ref> although in the end Steve Rogers takes 'custody' of Black Bolt's gem at the conclusion of the crisis.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Medusa becomes a member of the [[Future Foundation]] when the Fantastic Four take a time-traveling trip.<ref>''FF'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Medusa and Crystal introduce the Inhuman [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses]] to [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]], [[War Machine]], and [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].<ref>''Free Comic Book Day Avengers'' #1</ref> Medusa later catches Iron Man infiltrating New Attilan to claim Ulysses and fails to reason with him. After Iron Man defeats Medusa, Crystal, and Karnak and makes off with Ulysses, Medusa leads some Inhumans to Stark Tower to confront Iron Man which led the Avengers, the [[Ultimates (2015 team)|Ultimates]], S.H.I.E.L.D., and other superheroes to intervene. Medusa was present when Ulysses projected his latest vision of a rampaging [[Hulk]] standing over the corpses of the superheroes.<ref>''Civil War II'' #2</ref>

During the ''[[Inhumans vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Beast overhears Medusa telling the rest of the Inhuman Royal Family that they to be prepared just in case the X-Men lose patience in their truce and attack them.<ref>''IVX'' #0</ref> As the X-Men take action against the Inhumans, Medusa sends Iso and Inferno to find out what happened to Black Bolt and Crystal as she prepares for battle. Medusa then fights the time-displaced Beast in the lab of the original Beast as she effectively calls off the truce. As she gets the upper hand, Nightcrawler teleports in and takes her away.<ref>''IVX'' #2</ref> Despite the subsequent escalation of the conflict, when Medusa learns that the X-Men only attacked now because the Terrigenesis cloud was about to reach the point where it would make the whole planet toxic to mutants, she resolves the situation by destroying the cloud, preventing any further Inhumans from manifesting their powers, feeling that the future of her species is not worth the present loss of mutant life that would result. She also abdicates her throne to Iso.<ref>''IVX'' #6</ref>

In the aftermath, she along with her sister, Crystal, Black Bolt, Flint, Gorgon and Swain, are guided by Noh-Varr to the former Kree throne-world of Hala where he has stated they may discover the origins of Terrigen and in so doing offer a future to their doomed people, however, things are not well for the former Queen as she runs her hand through her powerful hair only to pull a large clump out with it, forcing her to announce to her crew that she is dying.<ref>''Royals'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is soon apparent that Medusa's decision to destroy the Terrigen Cloud is the reason that is afflicting Medusa. She did what she had to in order to save the Mutant race, but in doing so she had doomed the future of her people. Because Medusa had pressed the button, that act had the consequence of gradually draining the life energies from her. Akin to dying of a broken heart, Medusa had acted to end a cultural heritage that had lasted millennia and her body has essentially chosen to end with it. Her only hope now is to find the secrets of the Terrigen and bring a new source of it back to their people, so she too can be revitalized.<ref>''Royals'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Inhumans obtain the Primagen from the Progenitors' World Farm and Gorgon buys his fellow Inhumans time to get away, Maximus takes a sample of the Primagen and has a vision where the Progenitors attack Earth in retaliation for the theft of the Primagen.<ref>''Royals'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> While on the Astral Plane with Black Bolt, Medusa and Black Bolt agreed to continue as partners and not lovers.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Medusa possesses a long, thick head of red hair; thanks to her exposure to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist, every strand of her hair has greater tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and shear resistance than an iron wire of the same thickness. She possesses the psychokinetic ability to animate her hair for a number of feats, including elongating it to almost twice its normal length (Medusa's hair is approximately {{convert|6|ft|m}} in length when relaxed), and using her hair to lift and move heavy weights (up to 1.6 tons); a portion of her hair must be used to anchor the rest at these greater weights, so that more than her scalp/skull is used as a brace.<ref name="MU7">''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' #7</ref>

[[Image:Medusahair.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Medusa and her hair, by [[Jae Lee]].]]

Medusa can control the movement of her hair as if it were countless thin appendages growing from her head. A psionic field permeates her mutagenically altered hair-cells, causing mutual attraction across the gaps between strands. These relatively small forces operate in conjunction to develop larger forces. Through concentration, she can psionically move her hair in any manner imaginable. She can snap the length of it through the air like a whip (the tip of which moves faster than the speed of sound), or rotate it in a fan-like manner. She can bind persons or objects with it as if it were rope, or use it to lift objects which weigh more than she could lift with her arms. Her scalp, skull, and neck do not support the weight of an object that she lifts: It is held aloft by the psionic force coursing through the hair. Medusa can also perform delicate manipulations with her hair such as lock picking or threading a needle, and such complex acts of coordination as typing or shuffling a deck of cards. Although she has no nerve endings in her hair, she can "feel" sensations on all parts of her hair by a form of mental feedback from her psionic field.<ref name="MU7"/>

Medusa is an accomplished thief, using her hair. Medusa is also able to retain some degree of control over her hair after it has been cut or otherwise severed from her scalp.<ref name="Inhumans Graphic Novel"/> She presumably has the typical enhanced physical abilities granted by the genetically superior Inhuman physiology. She is also highly skilled at interpreting the gestures and body language of Black Bolt, and has a fluency in a special sign language used to communicate with Black Bolt.

Like all Inhumans, Medusa's immune system is weaker than that of an average human. However, due to her frequent ventures into the outside world, Medusa's immune system has been strengthened so much that it is no longer as weak as that of her fellow Inhumans. As such she has attained a resistance to the pollutants of the outside world, which enabled her to join the Fantastic Four (as well as be a former member of the Frightful Four) in the first place.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the alternate future of ''[[Earth X]]'', Medusa's hair volume has drastically increased. She has lost [[Black Bolt]] and fears the emotional loss of her son, Ahura. She is the acting ruler and Queen of the Inhumans. Many of her remaining friends and allies have mutated due to the incidents on Earth. As a way to tie together some of the powerful factions remaining on Earth, [[Captain Britain]] proposes to her.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Their story continues into the mini-series ''Paradise X'', where convenience has turned into love. However, the status of their relationship and their political positions is thrown into turmoil when Captain Britain's presumed lost wife [[Meggan]] is brought back to life.<ref>''Paradise X'' #4</ref>

===Heroes Reborn===
{{Main|Heroes Reborn (comics)}}
In ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'', Medusa's home city of Attilan plays host to the Fantastic Four. As in other realities, she speaks for her husband, Black Bolt. The Four are asked to help the Inhumans stop the plans of Maximus the Mad, who seeks out and plans to control the Terrigen Mists. The group at first does not understand the request, which leads to a battle. Medusa proves herself a capable fighter, helping to keep the battle at a stalemate.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

In this universe [[Galactus]] is worshipped, and the Royal Council pay reverence to him and his team of heralds in the form of finely crafted statues throughout Attilan.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Medusa appears in the ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' miniseries: ''1602: Fantastick Four'' as a member of the "Four Who Are Frightful", and the Wizard's lover. She has snakes for hair and must also wear a veil, to prevent her gaze turning men to stone. While her introduction describes her as "inhuman," Medusa's origins are not mentioned. She appears to be a native French speaker (hence, "Madame" Medusa).<ref>''Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four'' #1-5</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[Image:Ultimate couple.PNG|thumb|upright|Ultimate Medusa and Black Bolt, by [[Jae Lee]].]]
{{Main|Ultimate Marvel}}
A version of Medusa appears in the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' series, first appearing in the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] issue ''Annual 1: Inhuman''. She is still the queen of the Inhumans and wife to their leader, Black Bolt. As with [[Medusa|her namesake]], in this universe her skin is green in color and she has actual snakes for hair. It is not stated whether her newly serpentine hair restricts or enhances her abilities in any way. Along with [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], the Inhuman [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] is female and also Medusa's sister. Black Bolt's brother, [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]], does not display any romantic feelings for Medusa in this universe.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Unlike other versions, Ultimate Medusa is against all associations with the [[Fantastic Four]] and believes that the two races of Inhumans and humans can never co-mingle in peace. She also exhibits an extreme degree of loyalty towards her people, stating that there can be no greater honor than to put aside one's individual happiness for the welfare of Attilan. Despite these sentiments, she expresses regret over her husband's inability to vocalize his feelings. When Black Bolt does feel the need to safely speak, he vocalizes regret over Crystal's actions.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual'' #1 (2005)</ref>
