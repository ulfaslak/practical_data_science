==Fictional character biography==
When a [[racist]] team of villains called the [[Soldiers of the Serpent]] attacked T'Challa's friend N'Kano (who was on a diplomatic mission for [[Wakanda (Marvel Comics)|Wakanda]] in New York), A-Next tried to save him. As the Serpents battled with the heroes of A-Next, T'Challa's son T'Chaka charged into battle. While [[Mainframe (comics)|Mainframe]] tried to convince the youth to leave the battle, T'Chaka [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] into a feral black [[werecat]] called the "Coal Tiger". Coal Tiger's bestial abilities were able to turn the tide in A-Next's favor. He was offered membership with the team after the battle was won, but he declined, stating that he would be available to help if they needed him.<ref>''A-Next'' Vol. 1 #4</ref>

When all of the members of A-Next were captured by an evil version of A-Next called the [[Revengers]], Coal Tiger was one of the many heroes who came to free the captured superheroes. When A-Next was freed and the Revengers were defeated, Coal Tiger finally agreed to join the team.<ref>''A-Next'' Vol. 1 #4</ref>
