'''Captain America''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

===Steven Rogers (Revolutionary War Era)===
'''Captain Steven Rogers''', the 18th century ancestor of the World War 2 [[supersoldier|Super-Soldier]] serum recipient, wore a colorful costume and carried a round cast iron shield.<ref>''Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty'' #6 (March 1999)</ref>

===Steve Rogers===
{{main article|Captain America}}
Steve Rogers, a scrawny Army reject, was given the [[Supersoldier|Super-Soldier]] Serum, becoming the only complete success for [[Weapon Plus|Project: Rebirth]], and the first person to officially be called "Captain America" by the Marvel Universe's American government.

The [[Weapon Plus|Super-Soldier program]] experimented on [[African American]] test subjects, including Isaiah Bradley, to re-create the formula that had been used to turn Steve Rogers into [[Captain America]], similarly to the [[Tuskegee syphilis study]].<ref>''[[Truth: Red, White & Black]]''</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QrW9kmCAZQQC&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q&f=false Comics as Philosophy] p. 54</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2J7DpUItEMC&pg=PA498#v=onepage&q&f=false Encyclopedia of comic books and graphic novels, Volume 2] by M. Keith Booker, p.498</ref>
