'''Spider-Woman''' ('''[[Gwen Stacy|Gwendolyn Maxine Stacy]]'''; [[colloquial]]: '''"Spider-Gwen"''', '''"White Widow"''' or '''"Ghost Spider"''') is a fictional [[superhero]] in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She was created by [[Jason Latour]] and Robbi Rodriguez. The character debuted in ''[[Edge of Spider-Verse]]'' #2 as part of the 2014–15 "[[Spider-Verse]]" [[comic book]] storyline, leading to the ongoing series ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' that began in 2015. 

Spider-Woman is a [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|variant]] of [[Spider-Man]] and an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe version]] of Gwen Stacy. She resides in "Earth-65", where Gwen Stacy is bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes a superheroine instead of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man. The character also has to deal with various enemies, including Earth-65 versions of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] and [[Punisher|Frank Castle]]. Gwen Stacy's Spider-Woman is depicted as harboring much of Peter's personality and conflicts along with sharing his powers and abilities.

Spider-Woman was met with positive reviews from critics, with them applauding her design—cited as a popular choice for [[cosplay]]—and a [[feminism|feminist]] perspective. For promotion, several other versions of the character were developed, accompanied by merchandise. She was also featured on animated television series and in multiple video games as a playable character. [[Hailee Steinfeld]] voices the character in the 2018 animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-trailer-1202833788/|title=‘Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse’ Casts Hailee Steinfeld, Mahershala Ali and Lily Tomlin|website=Variety|last=Nyrem|first=Erin|date=June 6, 2018|accessdate=June 6, 2018|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6zyVhJtOX|archivedate=June 6, 2018|deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===In Earth-65===
In the alternate reality designated Earth-65, Gwen Stacy from [[Midtown High School]] is bitten by the radioactive spider and becomes a superhero going by the name of [[Spider-Woman]]. As Gwen Stacy, she is depicted as a drummer alongside her friends [[Mary Jane Watson]], [[Betty Brant]] and [[Glory Grant]], simply called the Mary Janes. Shortly after she begins fighting crime, one of her classmates, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], attempts to exact revenge on those who bullied him in Midtown High School, becoming Earth-65's version of the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Gwen subdues him, but Peter dies towards the end of the battle due to the chemical he used. Spider-Woman is blamed for his death, causing an outcry for her arrest, led by [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Her father, [[George Stacy]], a [[NYPD]] police chief, begins a hunt for her along with [[Punisher|Captain Frank Castle]] and Detective [[Jean DeWolff]]. While the Mary Janes are attempting to perform in a concert, [[Rhino (comics)|an assassin]] is sent after Gwen Stacy's father, who is in the audience. As Spider-Woman, she successfully defeats the assassin. During the battle, Captain Stacy holds Spider-Woman at gun point, with Gwen Stacy taking off her mask to reveal who she is to her father.

The device causes Gwen to arrive in the dimension one week prior to the accelerator explosion. Following her Spider Sense, she posed as a younger student at Miles' school where a mishap, with his new spider powers causes the right side of her head to be shaved. Gwen is later seen in Alchemax, when Miles and Spider-Man(Earth-616) are stealing information, that will help send them home. She intervenes in time to secure the data, and save the pair from Olivia Octavius aka Doc Ock. With the other Spider-People, Gwen is unconvinced that Miles has what it takes to help, and will only be a hindrance. She participates in the final battle at the particle accelerator where Miles proves himself to her and the other Spider-People that he's capable of being a hero and helps them return to their own dimensions.
