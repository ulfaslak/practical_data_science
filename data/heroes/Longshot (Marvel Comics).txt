'''Longshot''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], most commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Ann Nocenti]] and artist [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Art Adams]], he first appeared in ''Longshot'' #1 (September 1985), the first issue of a six-issue miniseries that represents the first major work of both Nocenti and Adams. The ''Longshot'' series established Longshot as an amnesiac fugitive from another dimension who discovers that he has favorable probability outcomes, or "good luck," that protect him when his motives are pure, and that he was a genetically engineered slave who led a rebellion on his dystopian world against his former master and enemy, [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]].

The character subsequently becomes a recurring fixture in the various X-Men related books, which see him as a member of the X-Men from 1986 to 1989, a member of [[Tony Bedard]] and [[Chris Claremont]]'s [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] teams, and a member of the [[X-Factor (comics)#Volume 3 (2005–2013)|third incarnation]] of ''[[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]]'' from 2008 - 2013, as well as in his own solo adventures. Versions of the character have also appeared in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books, and television and video games.

==Publication history==
{{double image|right|LongshotProposal.jpg|200|LongshotConceptByArtAdams.jpg|200|Left: Initial design for Longshot commissioned by editor [[Carl Potts]]. At right, artist [[Art Adams]]' concept designs for the character. Note the hand and spine studies, as per writer [[Ann Nocenti]]'s instructions.}}       
[[Ann Nocenti]] wrote the story for the ''Longshot'' limited series. After most of Marvel's artists had declined to take on the project, it was offered to aspiring artist [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Arthur Adams]], whose samples had been given to editor [[Carl Potts]] and Nocenti, his assistant editor, by editor [[Al Milgrom]].<ref name="CBA#17"/>

Explaining the concept of the character, which Nocenti borrowed from [[existentialist]] writers, she states, "Longshot is the idea of stripping someone of everything that they are. I never read comics, so the idea of a hero to me was different. I couldn't think of it in terms of a 'super hero' hero. I thought of it more as a conceptual hero. Not having a comic book background, I tend to come up with the metaphysics before I come up with the characters. I knew that I wanted to deal with the metaphysics of [[luck]]. It was a concept that interested me...what luck is, what probability is, how you could shift probabilities towards yourself. What are the repercussions of that? So, I did a character centered around that idea." Nocenti describes Longshot's state at the beginning of the miniseries by referring to him as "a clean slate. He has no memories, no past, no name, no nothing...In a sense, what I was trying to do was strip someone down to where he had none of the crutches that we normally have. Memory, in a way, is a crutch, or your name, or what you believe you are. So, Longshot's odyssey begins with some very basic questions: Who is he? Why is he here? Ultimately, he goes on a quest for his past and finds it in search of him."<ref name=MarvelAge>Ringgenberg, Steve (August 1985). ''[[Marvel Age]]'' #29. p. 13-15.</ref>

A design for the character of Longshot was put forward by [[Carl Potts]], who outfitted the character in a jumpsuit that Adams thought to be reminiscent of the [[Starfleet]] uniforms from ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''.<ref name="CBA#17">Cooke, Jon B. [http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/17adams.html "The Art of Arthur Adams"], Reprinted from ''Comic Book Artist'' No.&nbsp;17, 15 November 2001</ref> Nocenti suggested that Longshot look distinct from other superheroes. She prescribed that he be an alien, have only four fingers on each hand, and has an unusual spine, though this last trait was not mentioned in the comics.<ref name=MarvelAge71>"Art Adams interview". "The Mutant Report". Volume 3. ''Marvel Age'' #71 (February 1989). Marvel Comics. pp. 12 - 15.</ref> Adams created his own design, and wanting to distinguish the character visually, based his mullet haircut on that of musician [[Limahl]], as no other major Marvel character had such a haircut.<ref name="CBA#17"/> Adams, who disliked the practice of having characters produce weapons and other devices from their boots or secret pockets that had never before been established, decided to include some pouches on the character's belt, a practice that influenced the artwork of the founders of [[Image Comics]].<ref name=ModernMasters>{{cite book|last=Khoury|first=George|author2=Eric Nolen-Weathington |title=Modern Masters Volume 6:Arthur Adams|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|pages=|isbn=}}</ref> Nocenti came up with the idea of having Longshot's left eye glow when he uses his power for noble causes: "I was living in a loft on 26th and Sixth and we had a one-eyed cat. I'd go out at night and I'd see this one eye [glowing in the dark]."<ref name="back29">{{cite journal|last=Ash|first=Roger |title=Ann Nocenti and Arthur Adams Bet on a Longshot|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29 |pages=26-31|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

Longshot debuted in a six-issue, eponymous 1985–1986 [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]]. The series established the "Mojoverse", an alien dimension whose residents are addicted to televised [[gladiator]]-like entertainment and ruled by the tyrannical network head [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]. Longshot possesses [[probability]]-altering or "luck" powers, and is an action star who escapes enslavement by Mojo. With no memory of who he is, he embarks on a series of adventures with the people he encounters, among them Ricochet Rita, who Adams modeled after Nocenti.<ref name="back29"/> A ''Longshot'' ongoing series with Nocenti and Adams as the creative team was announced in 1988. According to Nocenti, "every issue is going to throw him into a completely different universe. So one issue, he's going to enter the world of the dead, and one issue he's going to go into a future world where he meets ageing heroes..."<ref name="MAge4">{{cite news|date=1988 |title=Marvel A to Z|work=[[Marvel Age]] Annual |issue=4 |pages=6–18 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> However, the series never materialized. [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] was to be the central villain;<ref name="MAge4"/> shortly after the series was cancelled, Nocenti began using Mephisto as a major villain in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''.

After the miniseries, Longshot joined the X-Men in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]] Annual'' #10 in 1986, and remained with them until ''Uncanny X-Men'' #248 (September 1989), appearing in various Marvel books occasionally, such as ''[[Exiles (comic book)|Exiles]]'', the 1997 [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Fools'' and ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', a book whose cast he joined in issue #35 (November 2008). He remained a part of that cast until that book's cancellation in 2013.

In November 2013 Marvel premiered ''Longshot Saves the Marvel Universe'', a four-issue miniseries written by Christopher Hastings and illustrated by Jacopo Camagni.<ref>Hastings, Christopher (July 22, 2013).

==Fictional character biography==

===Origins===
Longshot is an artificially created humanoid life-form, with the ability to defy probability.  He is from an alternate  dimension known as "Mojoworld" or the "Mojoverse".  He is one of many slaves created by genetic engineers in the employ of Mojoworld's masters, the grossly obese, virtually immobile Spineless Ones, who are ruled by the media-obsessed delusional maniac named [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]].  The head geneticist, Arize, gave Longshot and his other creations (such as the ram-headed Quark) free will and a conscience, hoping that one day they would rise up against their masters.

Longshot and many of his fellow slaves rebel against the slave-masters. They undergo a mystical ritual that gives them the power to create good luck for themselves. Despite this power, their masters win the war due to their superior weaponry and the limits of the slaves' luck. Longshot is rendered amnesiac by the Spineless Ones, but he manages to flee from Mojoworld to Earth. A number of Mojo's servants, led by the hound-like Gog and Magog, pursue him, but get stuck between Longshot's world and Earth. Unable to remember his real name, Longshot becomes an adventurer and takes the name "Longshot" after several humans call him that due to his incredible good luck. While recovering, Longshot befriends the human stunt-woman named [[Rita Wayword|Ricochet Rita]] and works as a movie stuntman himself. He also adopts the docile Magog, who he renames "Pup". Finally, Mojo and his assistant, the six-armed sword-wielding assassin named [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], follow Longshot to Earth. Longshot battles Spiral, and defeats Mojo with the aid of Ricochet Rita, Quark, and [[Doctor Strange]], who then send Mojo and his minions back to the Mojoverse. Longshot, Quark and Rita return to the Mojoverse to free the other slaves.<ref name=Longshot22>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Nocenti, Ann]]|penciller=[[Arthur Adams (comics)|Adams, Arthur]]|inker=[[Portacio, Whilce]]|title=Longshot|issue=1–6|date=September 1985–February 1986|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===Member of the X-Men===
After an unsuccessful rebellion, a once-again amnesiac Longshot is sent back to Earth by Mojo, where he joins the [[X-Men]].<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w), Adams, Arthur (p).

Before long, Longshot is reunited with Dazzler, and is teleported with her to Mojoworld. For a short time, they live in Mojoworld, until they are captured by Mojo.<ref>Lee, Jim; [[Lobdell, Scott]]; [[Byrne, John]] (w), Lee, Jim (p), Various (i). ''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #5–7.

Dazzler returned to Earth separately from Longshot suffering from memory loss, believing that Longshot, the X-Babies and everyone in the rebellion had been killed by Mojo and his followers.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

===''Longshot: Fools''===
After being "killed" by the Thingy and denied entrance into Heaven, Longshot realizes he has lost his innocence, the main source of his luck power. Ejected from Heaven and Mojoverse, Longshot finds himself stranded between Baum and Barrie, Kansas, pursued by the vengeful Thingy. When a child who has befriended the broken hero is damaged by the monster, Longshot, helped by a group of mental patients, rediscovers his faith in himself and his own purity despite the suffering of his wife to restore her to health. In the end, the unlikely group sets out for the big city, searching for adventure, secure in their luck and their innocence.<ref>''Longshot: Fools''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Exiles''===
Again suffering from memory loss, Longshot is recruited for the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] by [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Heather Hudson]] to help against [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]]. [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] claims<ref>''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #18-19. Marvel Comics.</ref> that he and all the other inhabitants of Mojoworld are "unique" in that there is no parallel counterpart to his realm. This would extend to Longshot, though what impact this will have on his membership in the Exiles is unknown. Morph reveals that Longshot's abilities cancel Proteus' reality warping powers, making him a perfect candidate for the team. He is brought aboard to replace the dead [[Mimic (Exiles)|Mimic]]. Longshot saves [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] from  Proteus in [[2099 (comics)|2099]], and saves Blink, [[Morph (comics)|Morph]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Star Brand]], Lenore Fenzl, and [[Nightmask]] from Proteus in the [[New Universe|''New Universe Approximation'']]. When the Exiles visit the future, Longshot tries to stop [[Hulk (comics)|Maestro]]'s rampage and stop Proteus from taking over Maestro's body. The Exiles finally corner Proteus at the ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'' world, and trap Proteus in Morph's body. With the hunt for Proteus at an end, Longshot remains an Exile to continue fixing damaged realities. During their last mission, Longshot is seemingly brainwashed into attacking Blink by [[Madame Hydra]] and the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]. Afterwards, Longshot leaves the Exiles during a mission on Earth-616 where he is re-introduced to Dazzler, whom he has no memory of nor their time together in Mojoworld.<ref>''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''X-Factor''===
After failing to rekindle his relationship with Dazzler due to his loss of his memories, Longshot shows up in Detroit after reading an article about his supposed appearance there during the events of Secret Invasion, thanks to a Skrull impostor. After a small fight with [[Strong Guy|Guido]], he helps [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] find out what happened to Darwin and his father, leading them to the Karma Project. During that time, he is seen commenting that women are too friendly towards him, and reveals that his memory losses are so severe that he doesn't even understand his powers anymore.<ref name="X-FactorV3#35">[[David, Peter]]. ''X-Factor'' Vol. 3 #35, Marvel Comics.</ref>

In ''X-Factor'' #47 it is once more hinted that Longshot and Shatterstar are related.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #47. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is not until a one-shot issue during the final ''X-Factor'' story arc, "The End of X-Factor", that their connection is explained. After Rictor and Shatterstar are transported into Mojoworld's past, they and the audience learn that Shatterstar is the only Mojoworld rebel who was not created by Arize the Creator, as he in fact mysteriously appeared from the sky one day. Arize then used Shatterstar's genetic material to create Longshot, making Shatterstar the father of Longshot genetically. Mojo later attacks Arize's sanctuary, so Shatterstar time-teleports himself and Rictor to a time in Mojoworld's history when Dazzler and Longshot are married and fighting a war against Mojo. Dazzler, pregnant with Longshot's child, goes into labor, and gives birth to a young Shatterstar, who Shatterstar explains to Rictor he will deliver to the future of Mojoworld to be raised by the people that raised him, but not before he erases Dazzler and Longshot's memories of their having a child.<ref>David, Peter.

==Powers, abilities and equipment==
Longshot was created through [[Genetic engineering|genetic engineering]] by Arize. Longshot has only three fingers and an opposable thumb on each hand. He also has leather-like skin,<ref name=Longshot2>{{Cite comic|writer=Nocenti, Ann|penciller=Adams, Arthur|inker=Portacio, Whilce|story=I'll Wave To You From the Top!|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=2|date=October 1985|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> and two hearts.<ref name=Longshot1>{{Cite comic|writer=Nocenti, Ann|penciller=Adams, Arthur|inker=Portacio, Whilce; Anderson, Brent|story=A Man Without a Past|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=1|date=September 1985|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> He is superhumanly acrobatic (speed, agility, dexterity, flexibility, reflexes/reactions, coordination, and balance) being able to evade blows by [[Spider-Man]].<ref name=Longshot4>{{Cite comic|writer=Nocenti, Ann|penciller=Adams, Arthur|inker=Whilce Portacio and Brent Anderson|story=Can't Give It All Away!|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=4|date=December 1985|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> He also has advanced healing abilities.

Ann Nocenti, who co-created Longshot, says of his primary superhuman trait, "Longshot has access to probabilities and luck. He's ''lucky'', he's miraculous in a way...he was born with this talent to have access to being lucky, and the problem is that he finds out that there's a flip side to luck. There are repercussions. If you pull probabilities towards yourself, you're probably taking them away from other people, so it's actually something that he shouldn't even be doing."<ref name=MarvelAge/> He was genetically engineered and augmented by magical means to have certain superhuman abilities. The mystical augmentation gave him the ability to affect probability fields through [[psionics|psionic]] means in order to give himself "good luck" in his activities. This allows incredibly unlikely events to happen in Longshot's favor. This power operates even when Longshot does not consciously will it to do so. This ability is tied into the positive aspects of his personality: should he attempt to use his powers for a selfish or evil act, or should he give up hope, his powers will fail to function or even backfire, giving him bad luck.<ref name=Longshot2/> Echoing Nocenti's words on the adverse side effects of his powers, Longshot's luck is fickle, and can backfire if he overuses it, creating an equal and opposite "bad luck" effect elsewhere, that can affect others or even Longshot himself.<ref name=Longshot5>{{Cite comic|writer=Nocenti, Ann|penciller=Adams, Arthur|inker=Portacio, Whilce|story=Deadly Lies|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=5|date=January 1986|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref><ref name=Longshot6>{{Cite comic|writer=Nocenti, Ann|penciller=Adams, Arthur|inker=Portacio, Whilce|story=A Snake Coils|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=6|date=February 1986|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> Longshot's left eye glows brightly when he uses his superhuman powers.

Longshot can read "psychic imprints" that people leave on objects that they have handled, and thereby learn the thoughts that an individual had while handling the object, a phenomenon known as [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]].<ref name=Longshot1/> He can also read a person's future in this manner as well.<ref name=Longshot5/> He can also telepathically "read" the recent memories of a person by making physical contact with him or her.<ref name=Longshot3/> Nocenti elaborates on the psychometry thus: "If you picked up a hammer and used it to bang nails every day and Longshot went to read it, he may not read much of it, but if it was used to kill somebody, that would leave a bigger psychic imprint, even if somebody held an object and cried over it, he would feel that too. If someone's emotional or intense enough around an object, they'll imprint it stronger, so he can read that."<ref name=MarvelAge/>

A recurring aspect of stories he appeared in was the strong, spontaneous attraction that women exhibited to him, a trait with which he was genetically engineered.<ref name="X-FactorV3#35"/>

Longshot carries cleaver-like blades, stored in a bandolier, which he hurls with inhuman accuracy or in some cases, completely dependent upon his luck powers. He is also shown as proficient in other types of bladed weaponry. During his X-Men years, Longshot also carried a folding grappling hook and rope either carried looped around one shoulder or stored in his shoulder bag, and a set of throwing spikes which produced net-like wires between them to restrain a target.

Longshot is proficient in the use of jetpacks for flight, the use of handheld [[directed-energy weapon]]s,<ref name=Longshot2/> and [[hang gliders]].<ref name=Longshot6/>

Longshot is an extraordinary acrobat, and has superhuman agility due to having hollow bones but musculature like a human's.{{issue|date=January 2014}}

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
Ultimate Longshot first appeared in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]] #54'', written by [[Brian K. Vaughan]]. In the Ultimate Universe, Longshot is not an alien but an ordinary [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] named '''Arthur Centino.''' His name is a tribute to creators [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Art Adams]] and [[Ann Nocenti]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Centino is accused of murdering a [[Genosha]]n politician; as punishment, he is sentenced to forced participation in a [[reality show]] where he will be hunted for sport. The show is run by [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo Adams]], and Longshot's first opponent is [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]].

The X-Men journey to the island Longshot is on, assuming he is innocent and was framed and thus offer to help him.  During the course of their time together, Longshot spends time charming Colossus.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #56. Marvel Comics.</ref>  It is later discovered that he ''is'' guilty; he had stumbled upon his girlfriend [[Spiral (comics)#Ultimate Spiral|Spiral]] with the politician and killed him in a fit of rage. Later, Longshot is in the [[Savage Land]] foraging for food when he runs into the [[Ultimates]]' [[Scarlet Witch]], who captures him and has him imprisoned in their [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] base. Longshot later successfully escapes from the Triskelion. During the escape, he seemingly kills [[Lady Deathstrike]], saving the lives of two of the X-Men who had freed him before. One of the others who escaped is [[Magneto (comics)#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]], who admits that he had tipped the authorities onto Longshot's location in the first place, as part of Magneto's own escape plan; Magneto wanted Longshot and his luck power present as an "edge" to guarantee success.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #62-65. Marvel Comics.</ref>

This version of Longshot despises normal human beings; he regularly uses the epithet "flatscan" when referring to them, introducing the term to the Ultimate universe.

When Longshot is last seen, the death of [[Charles Xavier]] is announced,<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #79</ref> the news reaches "Somewhere Else," apparently Magneto's latest stronghold. Longshot is seen, still bearded from his time on the run, seated on his own low stool at Magneto's right hand side, suggesting that the [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]ic young mutant holds special favor with the Master of Magnetism. This story by Robert Kirkman is entitled ''Aftermath: Part 1''.

It is later revealed that Longshot was somehow tortured and killed in the Savage Land under orders from Magneto.<ref>[[Loeb, Jeph]]. ''Ultimatum'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Shattershot"===
In the alternate reality future seen at the end of the 1992 "Shattershot" storyline (which ran through the 1992 [[annual publication|annuals]] of the X-Men-related titles), a mysterious hooded figure appears in the background when the former slaves and the Spineless Ones finally make peace. The hooded figure throws back his hood, revealing himself to be an aged Longshot. He makes a philosophical pronouncement, then says "Gotcha!" as he did while he was with the X-Men.

The X-Men and Longshot foil Mojo's plans. In the episode "Longshot", the hero develops a strong rapport with [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], and by the end of the episode, he returns home to continue leading the rebellion against Mojo. This relationship is referenced in a brief cameo in the fantasy-inspired episode "Jubilee's Fairytale Theatre", in which Jubilee, is placed in a [[Robin Hood]]-type role of saving a peasant Longshot from being execution at the hands of Magnus the Magnificent, a fairytale version of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].
