==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Bill Foster was born in [[Watts, Los Angeles, California]]. Later a biochemist, Dr. Foster worked in the Plans and Research Division for Tony Stark's [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] factory. He is hired to be the biochemical laboratory assistant of [[Hank Pym|Dr. Henry "Hank" Pym]]. At a time when the original Giant-Man was stuck at the height of {{convert|10|ft|m}}, Dr. Foster helps at Stark's behest find a cure to change Pym's size back to normal.<ref>''Avengers'' #32-35</ref> Foster continues to work as Pym's lab assistant.<ref>''Avengers'' #41, ''Avengers'' #54, ''Avengers'' #75</ref> Foster later investigates the apparent deaths of Pym and [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]].<ref>''Marvel Feature'' Vol. 1 #9</ref>

===Black Goliath===
[[File:blackgoliath bill.jpg|thumb|Bill Foster as Black Goliath on the cover of his own short lived title from the 1970s. From ''Black Goliath'' #1 (February 1976). Art by Rich Buckler.]]

Bill Foster's origin blurb from the first page of his self-titled book reads: "BILL FOSTER - Dr. William Barrett Foster, DSc, PhD - a child of the GHETTO who has pulled himself up out of the Los Angeles slums to become director of one of the nation's most prestigious research labs. A man whose research has given him the power to instantaneously grow to a height of FIFTEEN FEET, with the strength of a TRUE GIANT. A man who has become... a HERO."

Dr. Foster moves to the West Coast and acquires the formula to "Pym particles" which give him the ability to grow in size like his former employer. Taking the name "Black Goliath", he helps Power Man fight the [[Circus of Crime]].<ref>''Avengers'' #24-25</ref> He later battles the original [[Atom-Smasher (Marvel Comics)#Ronald English|Atom-Smasher]], the second Vulcan, and [[Stilt-Man]]. The mercenary [[Warhawk (Marvel Comics)|Warhawk]] kills Atom-Smasher, and flees before Black Goliath can catch after.<ref>''Black Goliath'' #1-5</ref>

Black Goliath later assists the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions of Los Angeles]] in battling Stilt-Man, then joins the group part-time as their technical advisor.<ref>''Champions'' #11-13</ref> Alongside Ben Grimm, Black Goliath battles the [[Hijacker (comics)|Hijacker]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #32-35</ref> After the Champions disband, Black Goliath and a large group of other heroes attend a [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] membership rally; this incarnation of Defenders battles a number of assembled superhuman criminals for only one mission before disbanding.<ref>''Defenders'' #62-65</ref>

===Giant-Man===
====The Project: Pegasus Saga====
[[Image:WestCoastAvengersAnn 3.jpg|thumb|left|Bill Foster as Giant-Man. From ''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #3. Art by [[Mike Machlan]].]]
Dr. Bill Foster later joins the staff of [[Project Pegasus]], the U.S. government's semi-secret energy research facility, as a biochemical researcher. While there, he reveals his Black Goliath identity to the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] working (at the time) in security for Project: Pegasus. In the process of answering an emergency alarm, Foster decides to change his alias to the name "Giant-Man" at Ben Grimm's suggestion. Alongside the Thing, [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], and the [[Wundarr the Aquarian|Aquarian]], Giant-Man defends Project: Pegasus against [[Nuklo]], the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]], [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], [[Solarr]], and the [[Nth Man]]. After working at Project: Pegasus for a short time, Foster reveals that he is dying from radiation poisoning he contracted in his earlier fight with Atom-Smasher.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #54-58</ref>

Alongside the Thing and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], he battles the Circus of Crime again.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #76</ref> Alongside the Thing and [[Captain America]], he battles [[MODOK]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #82</ref> Alongside the Thing and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], Giant-Man battles the second [[Atom-Smasher (Marvel Comics)#Michael English|Atom-Smasher]]. Foster's radiation poisoning takes a turn for the worse and he lies on his death bed. As Spider-Woman is immune to radiation at the time, Foster is given a blood transfusion from Spider-Woman. The process cures his radiation poisoning, but ends Spider-Woman's radiation immunity, and removes Giant-Man's powers as well.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #85</ref>

====Evolutionary War====
Bill Foster is next seen during the [[Evolutionary War]]. He is a scientist working for the [[High Evolutionary]] at his base in the [[Savage Land]].<ref name="West Coast Avengers Annual #3">''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #3</ref> After discovering the High Evolutionary's plans for a genetic bomb, Foster sends a distress message to the [[West Coast Avengers]]. [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], [[Tigra]], and [[Moon Knight]] are the only Avengers to answer his summons and join him in destroying the base. Foster reveals that he had been suffering from cancer since his last appearance. He retakes an improved growth serum, which adds clean (cancer-free) mass to his body, so he remains at giant-size until he can receive further treatment.<ref name="West Coast Avengers Annual #3"/> This was the last mention of Foster's cancer. Giant-Man later defeats [[Doctor Nemesis#Michael Stockton|Doctor Nemesis]] and [[Erik Josten]] in their scheme.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #113-118 (1992-93)</ref>

===Abandoning the hero role===
Bill Foster soon gives up the Giant-Man identity to which Hank Pym subsequently takes back for himself.<ref>''Avengers'' #368 (November 1993)</ref> Not too long after that, Josten's ionic powers are disrupted in a battle against the West Coast Avengers.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #92 (March 1993)</ref> This causes an energy disruption which allows a race of extra-dimensional creatures, the Kosmosians, to attack Earth. Although the creatures are ultimately repelled, the energy disruption and effects on the Pym Particles affect all that have ever been exposed to them, except Pym himself, causing them to lose control of their growth and/or shrinking powers. During this storyline, it was shown how Foster and Pym were trying to use Pym Particles to end world hunger.<ref>''Avengers Double Feature ... Avengers/Giant-Man'' #379-382 (October 1994-January 1995)</ref>

After losing his powers, Dr. Foster joins the [[Centers for Disease Control]]'s staff. In this capacity, he helps the Avengers deal with a bio-weapon released near [[Mount Rushmore]].<ref>''Avengers (vol. 3)'' #66 (June 2003)</ref>

===Final return===
Bill Foster somehow regained his powers. Under his Black Goliath identity, he appears very briefly as part of an ad-hoc team of "urban" superheroes ([[Luke Cage]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Brother Voodoo]] and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]).<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3, #17 (April 2000)</ref>

Foster dons the Goliath identity without the "black" in the name and along with a new costume to first help the Thing deal with a supervillain (along with hitting up for a research grant),{{issue|date=March 2015}} then help [[Spider-Man]] track down the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in order for Bruce Banner to possibly deal with Spider-Man's cellular degeneration.{{issue|date=March 2015}}

===''Civil War''===
[[Image:Goliathdeath.PNG|thumb|Bill Foster killed by [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]] in ''Civil War'' #4. Art by [[Steve McNiven]].]]
When the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] breaks out, Bill Foster as Goliath is seen as a member of Captain America's anti-registration Secret Avengers, adopting the alias '''Rockwell Dodsworth'''. He subsequently appears briefly amongst the cavalcade of other super-heroes attending the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s wedding.<ref>''Black Panther'' (2005) #18 (September 2006)</ref>

Foster is killed by a [[Ragnarok (comics)|clone]] of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] during a battle between the Secret Avengers and [[Iron Man]]'s pro-registration forces. Foster is buried as a giant, with Iron Man paying for the thirty-eight burial plots required to accommodate his body. His death affected the war's balance of forces, leading several characters to switch sides like Spider-Man defecting to Captain America's side.<ref>''Civil War'' #4</ref>

===Legacy===
Bill's nephew, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] student [[Goliath (Tom Foster)|Tom Foster]], informs the Black Panther of intending to follow in his uncle's footsteps by cracking the Pym Particle formula and being a hero.<ref>''Black Panther'' Vol. 3 #23</ref> Tom later publicly denounced [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and Iron Man because of his uncle's death.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #4</ref> Afterwards, Tom recreates and drinks his uncle's formula.<ref>''World War Hulk: Aftersmash'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, [[Norman Osborn]] dug up Foster's grave and removed his clavicle, hoping to use the Pym particle residue to track down Hank Pym's [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]. Foster's clavicle is later broken in half by Osborn in a fit of rage after hearing Pym's team being declared "the real Avengers" on national television.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #24</ref>

When [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] ventures into the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]], Bill Foster is one of numerous deceased characters seen in Erebus: the place in between life and death where those who feel they still have business in the mortal world linger and gamble for their resurrection.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>

It is later revealed that Foster had worked with Hank on a virtual reality program where one could upload their consciousness and live on after death prior to his own death. The grieving Pym uploaded Foster's mind into the program, in effect creating a virtual Utopia for his comrade.<ref>''Ant-Man & Wasp'' #1</ref> A.I.M. later attempt to hijack the program, but Pym was able to defeat them with [[Eric O'Grady]]'s help. During the adventure's course, O'Grady (disguised as Pym in the virtual world) converses briefly with Foster who says to stop pushing loved ones away.<ref>''Ant-Man & Wasp'' #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Bill Foster's superhuman powers are a result of his ingestion of a biochemical formula containing Pym particles. He has the ability to increase his size and mass to a gigantic size by psionically drawing extra mass from an extra-dimensional source while gaining superhuman strength in proportion to his height.  The extra mass returns to the extra-dimensional source as he decreases in size. The process of changing height is fatiguing, making Foster more vulnerable to harm, after successive changes.

Foster was able to routinely grow to {{convert|15|ft|m}} in height, and could lift approximately ten tons at that height. After regaining his powers during the "[[Evolutionary War]]", his level of power increased, and although precise quantification was not provided, he has demonstrated the ability to grow to {{convert|25|ft|m}} in height.

Bill Foster has a Ph.D. in biochemistry, and is a brilliant biochemist with a gifted intellect.
