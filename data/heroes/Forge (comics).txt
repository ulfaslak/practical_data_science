==Fictional character biography==

===Early years===
Forge is a mutant with an innate superhuman talent for [[invention]] and an [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] [[genius]]. He is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] of the [[Cheyenne]] nation.  Although he was trained as a [[medicine man]], he has primarily relied upon technology rather than [[mysticism]] to accomplish his tasks. This rift between Forge and his elder teacher, Naze, made Forge leave his past behind and join the military.{{issue|date=June 2016}}

While in the army, Forge served in the [[Vietnam War]]. After rising in the ranks to become a [[sergeant]], he was asked by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to join{{issue|date=June 2016}}. Forge declined, because he saw his need was in [[Vietnam]]. During his second tour of duty in the war, his comrades were killed by enemy troops; in anger, he used their spirits to summon a band of [[demon]]s to destroy the opposition. Forge, concerned about his former comrades, decided to order a [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombing on his position to close the portal from the world of the unliving. The bombs destroy the spirits, but he is injured as well, losing his right leg and right hand. This action allowed the demon called the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]] to come to [[Earth]], and Forge has since been hesitant to employ his mystical abilities.{{issue|date=June 2016}}

Years later, Forge creates [[cybernetic]] replacements for his lost limbs. When [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] stops making advanced weaponry for the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]], Forge is hired as an employee of the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #184 (October 1984)</ref>

One of his earliest commissions is to design a weapon to detect the shape-shifting aliens known as the [[Dire Wraith]]s. Subsequently, Forge constructs a device capable of neutralizing mutant powers. Following orders from the [[President of the United States|President]], [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], an agent of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], takes the device.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #184</ref> Forge protests because the device is untested and extremely dangerous to use. The device is used against [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who was wanted for allegedly killing a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.  However, the device instead removes the powers of her teammate, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #185</ref>

===Romance===
Forge rescues Storm after she falls into a river. Forge brings her back to his home in [[Dallas, Texas]]. During her recovery, romantic feelings develop between them. When she finds out he developed the device which removed her abilities, Storm leaves.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #186 (October 1984)</ref> They are briefly reunited to fight the common enemy of the Dire Wraiths, who are trying to prevent Forge from perfecting his neutralizer.  They are defeated by the combined forces of the X-Men, [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] and [[Amanda Sefton]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #187–188</ref>

Forge later improves his Neutralizer, but is hesitant to design more devices like it because of what happened with Storm. With the help of the Wraiths' enemy, [[Rom the Spaceknight]], Forge creates a large scale version of the neutralizer in Earth's orbit. Rom and Forge use the device on the Wraith's home-world, casting the entire race into the other-dimensional [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]].<ref>''Rom'' #66</ref>

After saving the world, Forge destroys all remaining Neutralizers and focuses on ridding the Earth of the Adversary. The Adversary, in the shape of Naze, convinces Storm that Forge was driven insane by her leaving and is planning to open a gate to hell.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #220–223</ref> Storm tries to kill Forge, but the moment she stabs him she sees that she was tricked.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #224 (December 1987)</ref> The Adversary banishes Storm and Forge to another dimension, devoid of human life. Storm and Forge spend an unknown amount of time there, rekindling their romance. Forge is able to restore Storm's abilities and use them to power a gate back home.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #226</ref>

===X-Men===
Forge and Storm arrive on Earth and join the X-Men in their battle with the Adversary.

The [[goddess]] [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] intervenes and secretly restores the X-Men to life.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #227</ref> [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], younger sister of X-Man [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], sees Forge as responsible for the death of her brother and attacks Forge, who fights back using his knowledge of Native-American sorcery. Feeling guilty over his involvement, Forge allows Magik to stab him with her [[Soulsword]] in the hopes it will kill him. Instead its effects cause both mutants to come to terms with their shortcomings.<ref>''New Mutants'' #66 (August 1988)</ref>

Forge, still unaware of the X-Men's resurrection, fights alongside [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]] and an interim team of "X-Men" against the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] at [[Muir Island]]. He uses his mutant skills to create a rifle that deactivates the cyborg enemy Skullbuster and forces the rest of the Reavers to retreat. During the battle, [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] is killed, but not before [[precognition|foreseeing]] that Forge and Mystique will one day love one another, a fact that both parties find implausible. Afterward, Mystique blames him for Destiny's death.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #254–255</ref>

Bishop steals several time travel devices that Forge is reverse engineering. Throughout his recovery, Forge is obsessed with recreating his notes and research on these devices. Fixated to an unhealthy degree on this project, Forge shuts himself off in his home at Eagle Plaza to devote all his time to this work. But before he begins, he enhances his home’s defense systems to ensure that he never falls victim to such an attack again.<ref>''X-Men: Divided We Stand'' #2 (2008)</ref>

===Ghost Box===
Forge later returns in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' #29, when the X-Men fly to his complex on Wundagore Mountain to confront him about his apparent role in an inter-dimensional invasion of Earth.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #29</ref>  After following a trail of mysteriously genetically-created mutants and death, the X-Men track Forge down, who through a monologue, reveals his true madness. He wants to save the world from the Annexation, an invasion from a parallel world on the other side of the Ghost Box, the transdimensional teleporter. He plans to send the X-Men to the parallel universe that is home to the Ghost Boxes to destroy them before the Annexation begins. The X-Men try to talk Forge down but he rebukes them and forcibly opens the Ghost Box, risking all life on Earth.

===Cable and X-Force===
As part of ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'', Forge is shown to still be alive following the destruction of his complex, and has apparently restored his original right hand (but still uses a prosthetic for his right leg). Forge is approached by Cable (after he used his telepathic abilities to help cure him of his insanity) to be in a new [[X-Force]] team created by Cable.<ref>''Marvel Now Point 1'' #1</ref>

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Forge appears as a member of Storm's X-Men as their primary technician even though his relationship with Storm is awkward and strained. Forge programmed [[Cerebro|Cerebra]] into the body of a Sentinel with the capability to showcase human emotion and the ability to teleport along with mutant detection so she could be a bridge between Earth and Limbo.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
Forge is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with a superhuman [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] talent for inventing mechanical devices, backed up by the ability to visually perceive [[mechanical energy]] in action. This power allows him to instinctively recognize the potential and functional uses of any machine or technological device in his visual range, a skill that combined with his natural intelligence gives him the ability to conceive, design and build highly advanced mechanical devices; and operate, modify and disassemble existing technology or create countermeasures for it. Forge's superhuman talent for invention does not mean that he is of a superhuman intellect, even a [[genius]] at invention must for the most part consciously work out the theoretical principles behind the invention and then the design of the invention itself through a series of logical steps. In Forge's case, however, many of these logical steps are worked out by his [[subconscious]] mind. Hence, Forge himself might not be entirely aware of exactly how he figured out how to create an invention of his. Sometimes, he must disassemble a device he has made to even figure out how it works.

Forge wore synthetic stretch fabric backed by micro-thin bulletproof Kevlar and thermal insulation while a member of the X-Men. He sometimes employs devices of his own invention.  Most notable among these was his Neutralizer gun that could suppress superhuman mutant abilities. The only known examples of this device have been destroyed. Forge has also invented a hand-held scanning device that can detect the presence of superhuman beings or aliens.

Forge has knowledge of many scientific and technological fields.

He also possesses various mystical abilities such as spell casting through mystical training, though he rarely uses these. He possesses extensive knowledge of Native American magic.

His bionic-robotic right hand (which he has since restored to its original organic state) and right leg often contain concealed weapons and devices that he can use in combat. In addition, they can be outfitted with computer interfaces and plasma blasters. His skill as a hand-to-hand combatant and as a marksman from his military training were so impressive that Nick Fury offered him a job with S.H.I.E.L.D.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] reality, Forge was a member of Magneto's rebels, the X-Men, and years of combat against Apocalypse's empire had left him a cyborg with a mostly-robotic body except for the right half of his face.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} He left them to go his own way and became the founder and leader of the Outcasts, an anti-Apocalypse resistance cell of mutants disguised as a traveling theatre group. The Outcasts' consisted of [[Sauron (comics)|Soaron]], [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], [[Sunder (comics)|Brute]], and [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], and later [[Siryn|Sonique]] and [[Mr. Sinister|Essex]], who is rescued by the group from the Infinites during their attack on a train. He became a father figure to [[X-Man|Nate Grey]], and also his trainer, teaching him how to combat without using his powers. When the Outcasts were attacked by [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] and her henchmen [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] and [[Grizzly (comics)#Grizzly (Theodore Winchester)|Grizzly]], Forge attempted to distract them with a Flash Grenade and later in the battle personally killed Grizzly for killing Toad. Forge was eventually killed by Sinister, who had been masquerading as a member of the Outcasts called Essex.<ref>''X-Man'' #1–4</ref>

===Here Comes Tomorrow===
In the apocalyptic alternate future of ''[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]'', the final arc of [[Grant Morrison]]'s run of ''New X-Men'', a British Mutant under the name Smith had taken Forge's alias, the Maker. Though his powers and his relation to Forge, if any, are unknown, he bore some physical resemblance to the former Maker, and also carried numerous mechanical tools.<ref>''New X-Men'' #151</ref>

===House of M===
Forge is seen in ''[[House of M]]'' as a scientist working under Tony Stark, [[Iron Man]]. He is one of Stark's most trusted employees and is one of the first to learn that he is truly Iron Man. He utilizes his skills in technology and computers by aiding [[Edwin Jarvis|Jarvis]] and Stark in tracking down the mutant gene bombs that [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] and Stark are hunting down all over the city.<ref>''Iron Man: House of M'' #1–3</ref>

===Hulk: Future Imperfect===
In the mini-series ''[[Hulk]]: Future Imperfect'', describing an alternate timeline where the Hulk becomes the Maestro, the Maestro claims that Forge created a weapon specifically designed to kill the Maestro, but that the Maestro killed him before the weapon could be used. The present-day Hulk would later encounter Forge using such a weapon.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk: Future Imperfect'' #1</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
Forge appears in ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' alongside Magneto's [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] as one of few survivors who were hiding on [[Asteroid M]] from the hordes of zombie [[superhero]]es on Earth. He constructs artificial limbs for the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] after the zombie [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]] consumes some of his original ones. Forge becomes close friends with Black Panther, and Forge's daughter later marries Black Panther's son and the couple later conceives a child. After the Panther's and Forge's children die under mysterious circumstances (later revealed that to have been murdered by Malcolm Cortez), both friends become closer through their shared tragedy, and help to raise their grandson together.<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #1–6</ref>

During the former heroes' forty years of absence, Forge anticipates that the zombies would return. Over the decades he and his forces plunder the technological remnants of the world. He makes improvements to Reed Richards' and Tony Stark's technologies for defenses of the colony New Wakanda, such as the Avengers' force field projector and [[Iron Man's armor]]s. The interdimensional transporter is the only technology Forge is unable to rebuild, and it is later revealed that [[Fabian Cortez]]'s son, Malcolm, has sabotaged it by removing some of its key components. Forge dons one of the Iron Man armors when the zombies return. After multiple extensive battles, the surviving zombies and the colonists begin a truce because the returning zombies' hunger has faded. Cortez ambushes and teleports the zombies to another dimension in order to seize power within the colony. Cortez kills Forge to hide this situation.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 2'' #1–7</ref>

===Mutant X===
The version of Forge who appears in the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' comic is virtually the same as his mainstream incarnation: he first used his powers to manufacture anti-mutant technology for the government,<ref>''Mutant X'' #13 (September 1999)</ref> and later becomes Storm's lover. However, because Storm has become a vampire in the Mutant X universe, he allows her to regularly drain blood from him so that she will not have to violate her oath to never take a life.<ref>''Mutant X'' #4 (January 1999)</ref>

===Ronin===
In the alternate reality of ''X-Men: Ronin'', the X-Men are superheroes based out of Japan. Forge is a Japanese police officer with an attraction to Storm. He also helps build and pilot an array of robots called ''[[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] Force'' which are sent against the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men: Ronin'' #2</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===<!-- This section is linked from [[Mystique (comics)]] -->
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Forge has been dramatically re-imagined. He became a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and follows [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] with the promise of getting to strike back at humans.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #27</ref> This version of Forge is also now of Asian [[India]]n descent, a play upon the mainstream version of the character's American Indian heritage. Despite this, this version's alter-ego still has the Native American name of '''Jonathan Silvercloud''' (which may be an alias).{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Magneto ordered Forge to invent a machine that would enhance his abilities to a point where Magneto would be able to kill every human on Earth. Forge, slightly naive, agreed to build it, the promise of Magneto's offer of ownership of Canada and a hate-free world blinding him. It was only at the final stages of his machine that he realized what he was truly doing -— about to slaughter millions of people. He attempts to confront Magneto about this, telling him that he was under the impression that Magneto would only frighten the humans. Magneto replies that in the start of a new nation, one must make sacrifices and coldly asks Forge if he is hesitating. Forge hastily assures him no; he is later seen depressed and angry.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #28–30</ref>

In the 'Magnetic North' storyline it is revealed that he was freed from prison by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. As a pair, they frame [[Polaris (comics)|Lorna Dane]] with one of Forge's devices. It causes her powers to malfunction, killing dozens of innocent people. Later, Forge does nothing as Mystique snaps the neck of a female police officer and assumes her form. As part of a carefully thought out plan, Forge and Mystique later personally attack the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]; the headquarters for [[the Ultimates]] and a supervillain prison. They kill dozens of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] soldiers during the attack and even more die cleaning up the prison break which results.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #62–64</ref>

He is then taken into custody, but escapes Triskelion using a phasing device, also helping Wolverine break out as well. Although, according to [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]], he orchestrated the escape in order for [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]] to lead him to the [[Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]]'s location.<ref>''Ultimate Hulk vs. Wolverine'' #4–5</ref> He is later tortured and killed in the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''Ultimatum'' #3</ref>

===Exiles===
An alternate version of Forge, who appears to be a White American with no apparent Native heritage (but still a cyborg with a robotic right leg, though now also with a robotic right full-arm instead of just a robotic right hand), is drafted onto the interdimensional superhero group the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]. Originating from Earth-2814, he was married to his reality's Storm. In this reality, the [[Skrull]]s [[Secret Invasion|succeeded in conquering Earth]], but Forge rebuilt and reprogammed Sentinel City to destroy their command city. He seemingly perished in the explosion, but was instead plucked out of time and put on the Exiles.<ref>''Exiles'' (vol. 3) #1</ref>

===Age of X===
An alternate version of Forge is present in the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality. He was present when Magneto used [[New York City]] skyscrapers to create his so-called "Fortress X".<ref>''Age of X: Alpha'' #1</ref>

===Old Man Logan===
As revealed by [[Old Man Logan]], Forge was not at the X-Men the night when the villains rose and Mysterio tricked Wolverine into killing his fellow X-Men. Many years later after the villains took over the United States of America and renamed it Amerika, Forge was shown living in a Cheyenne reversation in South Dakota when [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] led the Rhino Gang into invading. While Forge's highly advanced weaponry defeated the Rhino Gang, Forge rode an exo-skeleton which he used to beat Rhino to death. Upon ending up on Earth-616, Old Man Logan told Forge about the fate of his Earth-807128 counterpart. Even though Old Man Logan never visited the Cheyenne Reservation, he was sure that Forge was the one responsible for protecting it from the Rhino Gang.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #18</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Forge guest starred in a few episodes of the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series, voiced by Marc Strange.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} This version was unique in that he has two separate roles in the show: he's the leader of the government-run X-Factor in the present, and he leads the [[Xavier Security Enforcers|mutant team]] in the future that resists the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] in the [[Days of Future Past]] timeline.
* Forge also guest starred in ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'', voiced by [[Samuel Vincent]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} This iteration has the ability to turn one of his hands into a [[multi-tool]]ed robotic device in addition to his inventive genius — possibly corresponding to the comic version's prosthetic hand. Introduced in the episode "Middleverse", he was a teenager who was stuck in a pocket dimension since the 1970s when one of his inventions backfired on him. In return for [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] freeing him from Middleverse, Forge enhanced Nightcrawler's powers with technology, but suffered the consequences of tears leading to the other dimension as seen in the episode "Shadow Dance" where Nightcrawler's teleportation experiment with Forge ends up releasing strange creatures from a brimstone-like dimension. Luckily, Forge is able to use a special projector to send the creatures back after the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants managed to knock most of them out.
* Forge appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} This version works as the X-Men's engineer who is often seen working on repairs to the advanced systems of the mansion, such as the Danger Room, [[Cerebro]], and the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] (which he had to reactivate the cloaking technology when the X-Men had tracked Professor X's body to Genosha). This iteration is also portrayed as a much younger, inexperienced member of the X-Men and attends missions for analysis only. He is also the inventor of the mutant inhibitor collar which is highly sought after by the humans to use against mutants; [[Master Mold]] uses an evolved version as a containment for mutant prisoners in the future. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] has Forge download Master Mold's advanced coding and create a virus to counter. Equipped with an arm-mounted laser blaster, Forge is first seen in combat on a mission with Wolverine, Nightcrawler and [[Emma Frost]] to rescue [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]] from Mister Sinister.

===Video games===
