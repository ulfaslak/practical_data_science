'''Eric Masterson''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has appeared as '''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''' and later '''[[Thunderstrike (comics)|Thunderstrike]]'''. The character was introduced as a supporting character in the ''Thor'' title, but continued in several other comic books, including the self-titled series ''Thunderstrike'' in 1993.

==Publication history==
Eric Masterson first appeared in ''Thor'' #391, as a supporting character. ''Thor'' #408 featured the merging of the character Eric Masterson with Thor, Masterson being utilized as the God of Thunder's alter ego until issue #432.<ref>http://www.immortalthor.net/thor421-430.html</ref> ''Thor'' #432 featured the character assuming the role of Thor, and appearing as the title character until ''Thor'' #459.<ref>http://www.immortalthor.net/thor431-440.html</ref>

Following ''Thor'' #459, Masterson was introduced as "Thunderstrike" in the eponymous series starting in June [[1993 in comics|1993]]. The series lasted approximately two years. ''Thunderstrike'' ran for 24 issues, the series canceled in [[1995 in comics|September 1995]]. Creator [[Tom DeFalco]] has often claimed that the book outsold ''Thor'' and ''The Avengers'' combined at the time of its cancellation;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/specials/LifeOfReilly/11.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060327231333/http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/specials/LifeOfReilly/11.html |archivedate=2006-03-27 |df= }}</ref> although this has been shown to be extremely unlikely.<ref>[http://goodcomics.blogspot.com/2005/08/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-10.html Comics Should Be Good: Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #10!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Masterson also appeared in the mini-series ''Thor Corps'' as Thunderstrike, and appeared as a guest star in the ''Thor'' series.

"An A-Z Compedium of Earth's Mighiest Heroes" Avengers Casebook 1999 1 (1) (Feb 2000), Marvel Comics</ref> and crossover series [[Operation: Galactic Storm]]. Masterson also appeared in the mini-series ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' and ''[[The Infinity War|Infinity War]].'' Outside the many appearances in ''Thor'' and ''Avengers'', ''Thunderstrike'' was used to launch an [[ongoing series]] ''[[Blackwulf]]'', and a [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. ''[[Code: Blue|Code: B.L.U.E.]]''

It was announced that the Thunderstrike character would be returning in a new miniseries by co-creators Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz in November 2010.<ref>http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2010/08/defalco-and-frenz-to-revive-thunderstrike/</ref> Promotionals leading into the event began in August depicting the mace stating "One will rise..." and "The World Still Needs Heroes."<ref>http://marvel.com/news/all.13544.the_world_still_needs_heroes</ref> Ultimately, the new Thunderstrike miniseries featured Eric Masterson's son, Kevin, in the role once inhabited by his father.

==Fictional character biography==
===First encounter===
Eric Kevin Masterson was working as an architect when he met [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Masterson was injured by falling girders, and was taken to the hospital by Thor. Now on crutches, Masterson was attacked by [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]], but saved by Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #391-392</ref> Masterson was then abducted by [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]]. Masterson accompanied Thor to the Black Galaxy, where he first met [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. Masterson, mortally wounded by Mongoose, was given Thor's form and powers after the original was sealed in Eric's mind, by [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], to save Eric's life.<ref>''Thor'' #405-408</ref> Recognizing that his new life as Thor was too dangerous for a child, Masterson gave up custody of his son Kevin to his ex-wife Marcy, reasoning that Kevin would be safer with her, even if she was relatively ambivalent about her role as a mother.<ref>''Thor'' #421</ref> Masterson was then separated from Thor by the [[Celestial (comics)|Red Celestial]].<ref>''Thor'' #423</ref> Shortly thereafter, Masterson saved Thor's life, and was merged with him again.<ref>''Thor'' #425</ref> Masterson's son Kevin was captured by [[Ulik]] for [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. Thor freed Kevin and seemingly slew Loki in battle. [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]] separated Thor from Masterson, then banished Thor, and transformed Masterson into a new Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #431-432</ref> He then met the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] as Leena Moran, and battled Ulik.<ref name="Thor #433">''Thor'' #433</ref>

===Surrogate of Thor===
[[Image:Thor433.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Eric Masterson as the new Thor on the cover of ''Thor'' #433. Art by Ron Frenz]]
Eric continued in the role of Thor, after having been given Mjolnir by Thor, who then told Eric to carry on as Earth's protector. Eric then returned to Earth and joined the Avengers in Thor's place.<ref name="Thor #433"/> Masterson revealed his double identity to [[Captain America]]. He then first visited [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], where he fought the [[Warriors Three]], [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], Heimdall, and [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]], while trying to discover the whereabouts of the real Thor. Masterson then helped rescue the sleeping Odin from [[Annihilus]].<ref>''Thor'' #434-435</ref> He teamed with [[Beta Ray Bill]] and [[Alternative versions of Thor#Dargo Ktor|Dargo Ktor]] as the "Thor Corps" against [[Zarrko]] and Loki.<ref>''Thor'' #439-441</ref> During his time with the Avengers as Thor, Masterson aided them in such battles as [[Operation: Galactic Storm|the Kree/Shi'ar war]]<ref>''Thor'' #445</ref> and the [[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]] crisis, being one of only three heroes at the conclusion of that battle to remember the entire confrontation (the other two being [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Silver Surfer]]) as he had briefly witnessed Warlock's soul during the fight.<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1-6</ref>

===Thunderstrike is born===
Eric's role as Thor was relatively brief, as the Enchantress manipulated Eric into attacking Thor for Sif's affection. During a confrontation with Thor, Eric struck Sif. This provoked Thor, leading him to defeat Eric and reclaim Mjolnir while Odin revealed the Enchantress's manipulations.<ref>''Thor'' #458</ref> Odin then ordered the creation of a new mace for Eric, called [[Thunderstrike (comics)#Item|Thunderstrike]].<ref>''Thor'' #459</ref>

Eric first used the Thunderstrike mace against the villains [[Bloodaxe (comics)|Bloodaxe]] and Carjack, but he was promptly defeated. Afterwards, Eric created his own costume to distinguish himself from Thor, while keeping Thor's reputation intact. Eric renamed himself Thunderstrike, after the mace itself, operating as an adventurer and crimefighter.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #1</ref> Eventually Eric defeated  Bloodaxe, only to discover that Bloodaxe was actually Jackie Lukus, his current love interest.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #22</ref>

===Final conflicts and death===
After a confrontation with [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]] the Egyptian god of death, Eric realized that the only way to defeat him was to succumb to the curse contained with the Bloodaxe and increase his strength.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #22-23</ref> After his supposed slaying of Seth, Eric was confronted by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], who attempted to arrest him for murder. Instead, Masterson defeated the Avengers, and Thor confronted him. Eric pleaded with Thor to kill him to prevent the curse of the Bloodaxe from taking him over completely. But Eric was eventually forced to fight the Bloodaxe subconsciously, which manifested in Eric's mind in the form of [[Executioner (comics)|Skurge]]. Eric eventually defeated the Skurge duplicate, causing a psychic backlash that killed him and destroyed the two weapons. Claiming that [[Valhalla]] was not where he belonged, Eric was sent into the afterlife by Odin.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #24</ref>

===Returns from and to the dead===
Eric was temporarily resurrected by the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] several years later, along with several other deceased Avengers. After overcoming the Grim Reaper's control, he and the other undead Avengers were returned to the afterlife by the [[Scarlet Witch]]. Before he returned to the afterlife, Eric asked Thor to check in on his son Kevin for him.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #11</ref>

===Successor===
Eric's Thunderstrike mace (revealed to have been repaired by Thor and left in custody of the Avengers) was eventually given, by [[Captain America|Commander Steve Rogers]], to Kevin Masterson, who went on to become the new Thunderstrike and succeed his own father in the use of that identity.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' Vol 2 #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Eric's abilities are derived from the enchanted mace [[Thunderstrike (comics)#Item|Thunderstrike]], made of mystic uru metal, which is nearly indestructible, crafted by the Asgardian dwarves Brokk and Eitri, and given the following enchantments by Odin:
*Stamping the mace reverts Thunderstrike back to Eric's mortal human form, dressed in whichever clothes he last wore in that form, with any physical damage fully healed--with the exception of certain mystical spells such as Seth's Mark of Death, while the mace Thunderstrike transforms into a wooden cane. By stamping his walking stick on the ground Eric Masterson transforms back into his superhuman form, bearded, mustachioed, and dressed in the garb of Thunderstrike, while the cane again becomes the mace.
*The mace itself can be thrown over great distances and return to the point it is thrown from. By throwing the mace and gripping the strap, Thunderstrike can fly. (However, the comic emphasizes that Thunderstrike's is much rockier and less steady than Thor's flight.) He can use the mace to fire powerful concussive blasts of mystical energy. The mace magically enables him to survive the adverse conditions of outer space, including its lack of oxygen. The mace can also be used for tracking various energy sources and has the ability to create mystical vortices to travel from one place to another.
*Thunderstrike's physical abilities are enhanced to superhuman levels, including his strength, speed, durability, agility, reflexes, and endurance.

As Thunderstrike, he was one of the strongest heroes in the Marvel Universe, though his strength did not approach the level of Thor. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, and has received some combat training from Captain America and Hercules.<br>
As Masterson, he is a highly skilled architect, with a master's degree in architecture. He is near-sighted, and wears eye-glasses.
