'''Hyperion''' is the name of a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], of which there are several notable versions. The original Hyperion made his debut in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #69 (Oct. 1969), created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]]. The alternate versions are each from a different dimension of the [[Marvel Multiverse]], and consist of both heroes and villains. The character is a [[pastiche]] of [[DC Comics|DC']]s iconic hero [[Superman]].<ref>https://screenrant.com/characters-marvel-ripped-off-superman-copies/</ref>

The first Hyperion, Zhib-Ran, was a member of [[Squadron Sinister]], a team created by the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to fight against a team of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] gathered by the time travelling [[Kang (comics)|Kang]]. Two years after the character's first appearance, a heroic version appeared as a founding member of the alternate-reality [[Squadron Supreme]]. This incarnation of the character was a major character in the 1985 series ''Squadron Supreme'', which fleshed out the characterization of Hyperion and the other Squadron Supreme members. In 2003 Marvel Comics launched ''[[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Supreme Power]]'', a new take on the Squadron Supreme universe, where Hyperion is raised by the United States government to be a super-powered operative. Yet another alternate Hyperion joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and later the Earth-616 version of the Squadron Supreme.

==Publication history== 
The first iteration of Hyperion, created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Sal Buscema]], debuted in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #69 as a member of the [[Squadron Sinister]].<ref>''Avengers'' #69 (Oct. 1969)</ref> The team was loosely based on heroes from [[DC Comics]]' [[Justice League of America]], with Hyperion based on [[Superman]].<ref>Interview with Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails in ''The Justice League Companion'' (2003) pp. 72–73</ref>

Two years later, Thomas and penciller John Buscema created an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate]], heroic version of the Squadron Sinister called the Squadron Supreme, once again in the title ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'',<ref>''Avengers'' #85 (Feb. 1971)</ref> using characters with the same names as those of the Squadron Sinister (this caused confusion in Marvel's production department, as the covers of ''Avengers'' #85 and #141 claimed the issues featured appearances by the Squadron Sinister when it was in fact the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues). In the 12-issue ''Squadron Supreme'' limited series (Sept. 1985 - Aug. 1986) [[Mark Gruenwald]] picked up from where Earth-712 was last seen in ''Defenders'' #114 and revealed this Hyperion's origins.

The character is re-imagined for Marvel's [[Marvel MAX|MAX]] imprint title ''[[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Supreme Power]]'', where he is an alien who has been raised by the government. This iteration received a spinoff miniseries, ''Supreme Power: Hyperion'', which showed a dystopian possible future.

Another Hyperion joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s ''The Avengers'' vol. 5, #1 (December 2012). Hickman described the decision to use a new Hyperion, rather than an existing one:

<blockquote>This is yet another parallel universe Hyperion. This is not King Hyperion, or Supreme Power Hyperion, this is not Gruenwald's Hyperion. This is Hyperion without all that baggage. This is Hyperion with a fresh slate, for a very specific purpose. He comes out of what the big story is behind the whole Avengers three-year plan that I have. He's very important, very pivotal, and I think people are really going to dig where we go with that. He's not going to be our poor analogue for Superman.<ref name="HickmanAvengers">{{Cite web |last=Ching |first=Albert |title=Jonathan Hickman Brings the World to Marvel NOW!

==Fictional character biography==
==={{anchor|Zhib-Ran}}Squadron Sinister===
The Squadron Sinister are assembled by the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to battle the champions of the time-traveling [[Kang (comics)|Kang]], the superhero team the Avengers. Hyperion ('''Zhib-Ran''') is apparently brought from a [[microverse]]. The Avengers defeat the Squadron and thwart the Grandmaster, with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] shrinking Hyperion and trapping him in a glass sphere.<ref>''Avengers'' #69 - 71 (Oct. - Dec. 1969)</ref> The Squadron reappears in the title [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], reunited by the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]]. The villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the [[Arctic]] to melt the [[polar ice caps]], which would cover the entire planet in water. The superhero team the Defenders prevent the scheme and defeat the villains (and Nebulon), with the [[Hulk]] overpowering Hyperion.<ref>''Defenders'' #13 - 14 (May - July 1974)</ref> After this defeat Hyperion and his two remaining teammates are teleported off world by Nebulon, and later return to Earth. Acquiring an energy-draining weapon, the villains plan to threaten the Earth once again but are defeated by the Defenders and the Avenger [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]].<ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #4 (1974)</ref>

The character battles Thor once again and encounters the Earth-712 version of Hyperion.<ref name=Thor280>''Thor'' #280 (Feb. 1979)</ref> He becomes involved with [[Thundra]], but the relationship ends when she discovers a means of returning to her own dimension.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #67 (Sep. 1980)</ref> The Earth-712 [[Master Menace]] transports Hyperion to his universe and informs him that he is an inorganic duplicate created by the Grandmaster modeled on the Earth-712 Hyperion. The Squadron Sinister Hyperion then impersonates the Squadron Supreme Hyperion for several weeks before dying in battle against the original.<ref name="Squadron Supreme' 1986">''Squadron Supreme'' #8 (Apr. 1986)</ref> The Grandmaster briefly resurrects the character as part of a group called the [[Legion of the Unliving]] to combat the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #16 (Dec. 1987)</ref>

A new Hyperion is made when the Grandmaster reforms the Squadron Sinister. He is joined by a new Doctor Spectrum ('''Alice Nugent''', former lab assistant of Henry Pym); the [[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]] (now called [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]]), and Nighthawk. This Hyperion originated from the Microverse, as the original Hyperion had believed himself to have been. The Grandmaster increases the Squadron Sinister's powers and they battle the New Thunderbolts. Thunderbolts team leader [[Baron Zemo]] defeats the Grandmaster, and in the ensuing chaos Hyperion and his teammates scatter and escape.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #15 - 16 (Jan. - Feb. 2006); ''Thunderbolts'' #102 - 108 (July 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref>

==={{anchor|Earth-712}}Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)===
Hyperion, also known as '''Mark Milton''', is a founding member of his reality's [[Squadron Supreme]] and the last known [[Eternal (comics)|Eternal]] left on his Earth.<ref>''Quasar'' #16</ref> Four Avengers from the [[Earth-616]] universe accidentally arrive in this Squadron's reality, and the two groups first battle and then work together to stop the global threat posed by the mutant Brain-Child.<ref>''Avengers'' #85 - 86 (Feb. - Mar. 1971)</ref>

Following the societal instability caused by Overmind's takeover of the planet, Hyperion and other Squadron members resolve, against their teammate [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-712)|Nighthawk's]] advice, to assume control of their [[United States]] government, instituting programs aimed at increasing quality of life; for instance Hyperion helps establish a behavior modification program,<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #2 (Oct. 1985)</ref> which the team uses to [[Brainwashing|brainwash]] the [[Institute of Evil]] and numerous other criminals.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #5 - 6 (Jan. - Feb. 1986)</ref> He becomes trapped in an inter-dimensional zone and is impersonated by the Squadron Sinister Hyperion (Zhib-Ran). Forced to ally himself with Master Menace to escape, Hyperion battles Zhib-Ran to the death; although he wins, he is blinded in the fight.<ref name="Squadron Supreme' 1986"/> After a battle to the death with Nighthawk and the [[America Redeemers|Redeemers]], a team formed to stop the domineering Squadron, Hyperion relents and relinquishes power.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #12 (Aug. 1986)</ref>

===Supreme Power===
{{see also|Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)}}
This Hyperion was sent to Earth in a spacecraft, and seized shortly after by U.S. government agents who raised him in a tightly controlled, isolated environment.<ref>''Supreme Power'' #1</ref> As an adult, he became a covert agent used in strict secrecy, but eventually a reporter came too close to the truth, and the decision was made to make his existence public,<ref>''Supreme Power'' #3</ref> largely so he could be used as a distraction from the government's even more closely guarded secret super-operative, [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-31916)|Joe Ledger]].<ref>''Supreme Power'' #4</ref> He briefly allies himself with [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-31916)|Nighthawk]] and [[the Atlanta Blur|Blur]] to find and defeat the super-powered [[serial killer]] [[Redstone (comics)#Supreme Power|Michael Redstone]].<ref>''Supreme Power'' #12-14</ref> As Hyperion discovers that he has been systematically lied to his entire life,<ref>''Supreme Power #2-9</ref> he becomes disillusioned with the government and eventually openly rebels.<ref>''Supreme Power'' #9</ref> When the government attempts to blackmail him into returning by revealing his alien status to the public, he responds by smashing into the [[North Pole]] from space, creating a [[Richter scale|10.5]] seismic event.<ref>''Supreme Power'' #18</ref><ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #1</ref>

In the ''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' miniseries, a hastily assembled team of superhumans is sent by the government to retrieve him, and the resulting battle—through an interaction of Hyperion's "flash vision" eye-beams, [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)#Supreme Power|Nuke]]'s radiation blast, and [[Arcanna#Squadron Supreme (Earth-31916)|Arcanna]]'s reality manipulation—sends the combatants into what appears to be an [[alternate timeline]]<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #2</ref> where Hyperion and the Squadron Supreme rule a [[dystopian]] world. This causes Hyperion (on his counterpart's advice)<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #4</ref> to rethink his ideas about power, humanity, and teamwork, leading him to surrender to the Squadron from his world.<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #5</ref> [[Master Menace#Supreme Power|Emil Burbank]] later deduces that it was not an alternate world they traveled to, but their own future; Burbank tells no one of his discovery.

Hyperion is apparently killed during the 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]'' event.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #24</ref>

===Squadron Supreme (Earth-616)===
This Hyperion was sent to his reality's Earth as a baby, the only survivor of a race of Eternals from a dying world.

As an adult, he became the superhero named Hyperion and protected the world alongside the Squadron Supreme. When his reality collided with another, Hyperion was the only survivor, floating around in the void that had been his universe until a group of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] scientists pulled him into the Earth-616 reality. Hyperion was in the captivity of A.I.M. until he was freed by the Avengers and offered a place amongst them.<ref name="Avengers #4">''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #4</ref> Hyperion is among the superheroes that joined the Avengers due to the threat of [[Ex Nihilo (comics)|Ex Nihilo]] on Mars.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #2</ref> Hyperion was with the Avengers when A.I.M. was sighted in the [[Savage Land]] trying to extract the formula from one of the Garden's evolution pods.<ref name="Avengers #4"/> Hyperion later joins the Earth-616 version of the Squadron Supreme along with other various heroes who survived their home realities' destruction.

All versions of Hyperion possess superhuman strength, stamina, speed, durability, flight, and in a few cases powerful breath. Each also has greatly enhanced sensory perceptions, which extends to being able to perceive the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]] (IR, UV vision; radio hearing and radar){{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} and "atomic vision" - the equivalent of Superman's x-ray vision. The heroic Earth-712 version of Hyperion also possesses the ability to use cosmic energy to augment his life force granting him great longevity and regenerative abilities, courtesy of his Eternal heritage. Most of the alternate Hyperions' powers and vitality are diminished when exposed to "argonite radiation", the equivalent of Superman's [[kryptonite]]. The Earth-712 Hyperion also has a [[college degree]] in [[journalism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Other versions==
===Exiles===

Nighthawk later shoots Hyperion with an argonite gun, and holds his own in a fight with him using Doctor Spectrum's power prism until Hyperion is so weakened by the argonite that Nighthawk simply strangles him to death with his bare hands.<ref>''Squadron Sinister'' #4 (2015)</ref>
