==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Clayton Cortez was an ex-military mercenary working for Eaglestar who was hired to take out the villagers in Ujanka for interfering with [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]'s pipeline work. Feeling remorse for his actions, Clayton killed his own men and spared the villagers. For his betrayal, he was kidnapped and sold to Dr. Alba of the [[Weapon X]] Project's Batch-H division.<ref>''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Weapons of Mutant Destruction===
Clayton was infused with the DNA harvested from [[Amadeus Cho]]'s [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] form and [[Old Man Logan]] as well as being subjected to the Adamantium-bonding and being injected with nanites reverse-engineered from Lady Deathstrike's nanites that was also in the Adamantium. Much of his brain was left intact so that he could be better disciplined.<ref>''The Totally Awesome Hulk'' #21</ref> Clayton's hybrid form resembles a gray-skinned Hulk with retractable claws and adamantium protrusions on his back, shoulders, and parts of his legs. Eventually, Clayton was released as '''H-Alpha''' who along with his more primitive precursor H-Beta fought Amadeus Cho's Hulk form and the current team known as [[Weapon X]]. Though H-Alpha was the apex predator and killed H-Beta before engaging Hulk. Clayton regained much of his humanity, even though he tried to kill Dr. Alba, and soon fled the battle.<ref>''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''The Totally Awesome Hulk'' #22</ref>

Now calling himself Weapon H, Clayton set out to every Eaglestar facility that carried information about himself and his family. Dr. Alba caught up to him and injected nanites into his body so that he would not be able to resist her command.<ref>''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> He once again encountered the Weapon X team, but the [[X-23|new Wolverine]] manage to break him free. Clayton resumed his mission to destroy the Eaglestar facilities.<ref>''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #7-8. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Targeted by Roxxon===
While resisting the change upon joining Roxxon's archaeological expedition to find a [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]], Clayton assumed his Weapon H form and saved Roxxon scientist Dr. Ella Stirling from an Ur-Wendigo as Roxxon takes an interest in Weapon H. Though this also attracted the attention of [[Doctor Strange]] who plans to deal with Weapon H and the Ur-Wendigo.<ref>''Weapon H'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While Weapon H is getting Dr. Stirling to safety, the Ur-Wendigo caught up to Weapon H and took a bite out of his skin causing the Ur-Wendigo to get larger. Doctor Strange showed up to help fight the Ur-Wendigo where his magic attacks have no effect on the Ur-Wendigo. Using Doctor Strange's Axe of Angarruumus, Weapon H went inside the Ur-Wendigo and killed it from within.<ref>''Weapon H'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Using the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] that is in Roxxon's possession, [[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]] had Dr. Baines unleash Brood-infected wolves, Brood Drones, Brood-infected Space Sharks, and a Brood-infected human named Blake riding an [[Acanti]] to attack Weapon H. With the Brood slain and the Acanti knocked out, Weapon H demanded answers from the Brood-infected human Blake on why Roxxon is after him. Blake stated that Roxxon wanted Weapon H to work for them. After mentioning that those who are said to help people actually harm people, Weapon H has Blake forward a message to Roxxon to leave him alone. As Clayton is walking through the [[Redwood National and State Parks|Redwood National Forest]], Dario instructs Dr. Baines to "initiate the spawn" which awakens a spawn of [[Man-Thing]].<ref>''Weapon H'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After doing some thinking, Clayton is attacked by the spawn of Man-Thing causing him to turn into Weapon H. Dario speaks through the Fly-Spies stating that this spawn of Man-Thing had its abilities enhanced with the DNA of [[Groot]]. When Dario states that he will find out who he is and who the woman looking for him is, Weapon H sets off the Man-Thing's immolation touch enough to cause a fire in Redwood National Forest. As Weapon H continues his fight with Roxxon's Man-Thing, a woman named Sonia runs into Dr. Stirling who was also looking for Weapon H. After Weapon H subdues Roxxon's Man-Thing, he tells Dr. Stirling that nobody is supposed to find her as it is confirmed that Sonia is Clayton's wife. Upon seeing Roxxon's Fly-Spies, Weapon H throws Sonia and Dr. Stirling into the water as he uses his power clap to put out the fires and defeat Roxxon's Man-Thing. A Roxxon aircraft then launches blades into Weapon H to reel him in. The pilot contacts Dario Agger and states that they got Weapon H as Blake warns Dario that Weapon H kills everything. As Weapon H is flown away from Sonia and Dr. Stirling, Dario claims that Weapon H made a noble sacrifice as he is a hero at heart.<ref>''Weapon H'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Collaborating with Roxxon===
As Weapon H is affected by an Elvish Binding Scroll, Dario Agger introduces himself to him and reviews his creation while also noting that the genetic material of [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Lady Deathstrike]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] are in him. He plans to find out who Weapon H is and plans to make a deal with him. When Weapon H states that every person who says that they want to help people only destroyed them, Dario wanted to destroy those who aren't human. When Weapon H starts acting up, Dario plans to do things the hard way as he has Dr. Baines proceed with the lobotomy. Dr. Baines does so as the effects of the Elvish Binding Scroll starts to wear off. After Ella Stirling shuts down the power to the laboratory, Dario flees leaving the scientist at the mercy of Weapon H. As Weapon H fights the security guards, he finds Blake and Roxxon's Man-Thing in cages as they beg for him to let them out. As Weapon H remembers them, Blake states that Dario used them as tools in exchange for being released from Roxxon's services. Weapon H slashes the cages and tells them that they are on their own. When security robots show up, Weapon H is assisted by Blake and Roxxon's Man-Thing even when Sonia and Dr. Stirling show up. After Weapon H regresses back to Clayton and explains that he had to keep his distance in the event that Roxxon targets her and their kids, Dario arrives wanting the group to hear him out as he explains that Roxxon is wanting to obtain extraterrestrial resources leading him to show the group a portal to an extradimensional region that has magic enough to power the planet for a million years. However, the monsters on the other side of the portal want to kill every human. Sonia advises Clayton to deal with the threat as he transforms into Weapon H.<ref>''Weapon H'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Dr. Baines reveals to the group that the portal leads to [[Weirdworld]] and that the damage to the facility has fractured the portal enough for creatures like the Skrullduggers to get through. Weapon H, Sonia Sung, Dr. Stirling, Blake, and Roxxon's Man-Thing left the building. When an explosion happens when they are outside, Weapon H goes on the defensive when the Skrullduggers emerge from the portal and attack as Blake and Man-Thing join the fight against them. The group discovers that the Skrullduggers are shapeshifters. When Weapon H goes near the Skrullduggers posing as kids, he is attacked by [[Captain America]] who thinks that Weapon H is going to harm the children. The two Skrullduggers shed their disguise and try to attack a woman until they are defeated by Weapon H and Captain America. After both of them are reprimanded for their actions by Sonia, Captain America and Weapon H agree to work together to fight the rest of the Skrullduggers.<ref>''Weapon H'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As Weapon H and Captain America continue their fight with the Skrullduggers, Weapon H thinks back to his childhood where he was beaten by his father, fought some bullies, and was beaten up by prisoners. As Man-Thing secures the defeated Skrullduggers, Captain America states to Weapon H that he was trailing some illegal shipments going from Stane Industries to Roxxon. After Dr. Stirling confirmed that the Skrullduggers came from the Skrull's planet, Dario Agger stated to Weapon H, Captain America, and those present that the Skrullduggers are an invasive species that have no protection under the Multiversal Mineral Rights Exploitation Agreement. Agger still wants Weapon H to deal with the Skrullduggers on behalf of his country as the entire Multiverse wants them dead while Captain America suggests that they follow the interstellar law by contacting the [[Alpha Flight]] Space Program. When the Skrullduggers resume their attack, Weapon H and Captain America go on the offensive while Blake and Man-Thing work to keep more Skrullduggers from coming through the portal. After most of them are defeated by Weapon H and Captain America, the Alpha Flight Space Program is contacted to pick up a live Skrulldugger specimen in an armored specimen transport for their xenobiologist to study it only for Dario to have it bombed with missiles. This angers Weapon H as Captain America tries to calm Weapon H. Captain America persuades him to take Dario's offer in order to be his soldier on the inside. When Weapon H and Dario go to check on Blake and Man-Thing 10 minutes later, they find that they have been assisted by [[Korg (comics)|Korg]] in taking a few of the Skrullduggers out.<ref>''Weapon H'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

====Journey to Weirdworld====
Weapon H hears from Korg that the Roxxon soldiers on Weirdworld are safe in a bunker. Weapon H states that he will do the mission in exchange that Roxxon leaves him, Sonia, her kids, and her mom alone, Blake wanting to be restored to normal while receiving $10,000,000.00, and Sonia and Dr. Ella Stirling acting as mission control for the mission. In addition, Weapon H learns that Dario has brought in [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] and ex-[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operative Angel to help out on the field mission. After a talk with Sonia, Clay is allowed a contact to his kids and mother-in-law that was secretly arranged by Captain America. As Weapon H leads the mission to Weirdworld, they are attacked by a tribe of blue-skinned humanoids who blame them for breaking the Earth and allowing the Skrullduggers to take their queen.<ref>''Weapon H'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Their captors are revealed to be the Inaku who come from the planet of the same name and have settled on Weirdworld as Protector Hara mentioned that they blamed Roxxon for the death of their fellow Inaku. After Weapon H regressed himself back to normal, he changed again and destroyed Protector Hara's orb which was a gift from their queen. This led to Titania to knock out Protector Hara which resulted in the damages to the protective dome that protected their village from the Skrullduggers as Clayton reprimands her. While Man-Thing, Korg, and Titania stay with the Inaku in case the Skrullduggers arrive, Weapon H takes Angel and Blake on a stealth mission to find the Roxxon outpost. After being contacted by Dario Agger, Weapon H states to Angel and Blake that Dario "showed his hand" by wanting them to also kill the Skrullduggers. Sonia states that there are three engineers and six Roxxon guards taking refuge with one of them being Dr. Carrie Espinoza. After a power failure at Roxxon, Dario's latest contact to Weapon H alerts the Skrullduggers outside the outpost. After slaying some of the Skrullduggers, Weapon H, Angel, and Blake make their way into the Roxxon outpost where they meet the engineers and soldiers there to rescue them where they have found a way to harness the magic. Weapon H discovers that the magic that they are harvesting is coming from [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] of Earth-15238.<ref>''Weapon H'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Weapon H was against the imprisonment of Morgan le Fay despite Dr. Carrie Espinoza's claim that she is the most dangerous sorceress who ever lived. When Weapon H starts to go on the attack, Angel stated that she had no knowledge of what Roxxon was doing with Morgan le Fay who advises Weapon H not to listen to her lies. After revealing parts of her backstory, Morgan le Fay stated that she found a way to tame the Skrullduggers until Roxxon invaded, took her captive, destroyed her palace, and caused the Skrullduggers to run wild. As Angel tries to prevent Weapon H and Blake from falling into Morgan le Fay's control, Morgan mesmerizes them where she claims that she can cure Blake and reveals Weapon H's full identity of Clayton Cortez. Dr. Espinoza then has a soldier named Granville open the door enabling the Skrullduggers to get in. After Weapon H blocked the entrance from the Skrullduggers, Morgan le Fay exposes that Angel is actually [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]]'s clone using an Image Inducer claiming that Captain America sent her to spy on Weapon H. Still under Morgan's control, Weapon H who regains control of the Skrullduggers. After destroying the facility, Morgan le Fay leads a mind-controlled Weapon H and the Skrullduggers into taking over the world.<ref>''Weapon H'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Now under Morgan le Fay's control, Weapon H leads the attack on the Inaku village where Morgan le Fay's appearance surprises Korg and Titania. As Morgan le Fay is a queen to the Inaku, they assist Weapon H in attacking Korg and Titania. As Weapon H faces off against Korg, Black Widow works to get Sonia to get through to Weapon H. Dario Agger takes control of the transmission stating that he has a map to an escape route for them to use only to lead them into a box canyon. After knocking out Dario, Sonia takes a speeder and heads to Weirdworld to get to Weapon H. After breaking free from Morgan le Fay's mind-control, Weapon H briefly left Weirdworld and returned to have Dario disarm the gun so that he would save the world and his own skin.<ref>''Weapon H'' #11.
