'''Ghost Rider''' is the name of many [[antihero]]es<nowiki/> appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  Marvel had previously used the name for a [[Western comics|Western]] character whose name was later changed to '''[[Phantom Rider]]'''.

The first [[supernatural]] Ghost Rider is [[stunt]] [[motorcycle|motorcyclist]] '''[[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]''', who, in order to save the life of his father, agreed to give his soul to "[[Satan]]" (later revealed to be an arch-demon named [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]). At night and when around evil, Blaze finds his flesh consumed by hellfire, causing his head to become a flaming skull. He rides a fiery motorcycle and wields blasts of hellfire from his body, usually from his skeletal hands. He eventually learns he has been bonded with the demon [[Zarathos]]. Blaze was featured in the ''[[Ghost Rider (comic book)|Ghost Rider]]'' series from 1972 to 1983. The subsequent ''Ghost Rider'' series (1990–1998) featured '''[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]]''' as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by [[ninja]] [[gangster]]s, Ketch came in contact with a motorcycle that had somehow been mystically enchanted to contain the essence of a Spirit of Vengeance. Blaze reappeared in this 1990s series as a [[supporting character]], and it was later revealed that Danny and his sister were Johnny Blaze's long lost siblings. In 2000s comics, Blaze again became the Ghost Rider, succeeding Ketch. In 2013, '''[[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]]''' became Ghost Rider as part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] initiative.

[[Nicolas Cage]] starred as the Johnny Blaze iteration of the character in the 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]]'' and its 2012 sequel, ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]''. [[Gabriel Luna]] plays Robbie Reyes in the television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Johnny Blaze===
{{main|Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)}}
Following the [[Phantom Rider|western comics character]] who originally used the name, the first superhero Ghost Rider, '''Johnny Blaze''', debuted in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #5 (August 1972), created by Marvel editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]],<ref>https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/marvel-legend-roy-thomas-visited-stan-lee-days-before-his-death-heres-what-happened</ref>  writer [[Gary Friedrich]] and artist [[Mike Ploog]]. He received his own series in 1973, with [[penciller]] [[Jim Mooney]] handling most of the first nine issues. Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciller [[Don Perlin]] began a considerably long stint with issue #26, eventually joined by writer [[Michael Fleisher]] through issue #58. The series ran through issue #81 (June 1983). Blaze returned as Ghost Rider in a 2001 six-issue miniseries written by [[Devin Grayson]]; a second miniseries written by [[Garth Ennis]] in 2005, and an ongoing monthly series that began publication in July 2006. Johnny Blaze was the son of Naomi Blaze and Barton Blaze, Naomi being the previous Ghost Rider.

===Noble Kale===
Noble Kale was the original Ghost Rider, from the 18th century. He became the Ghost Rider in order to defend his hometown from the Furies, but killed himself when his son was offered to him as a sacrifice.{{Issue|date=January 2019}}

===Danny Ketch===
{{main|Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)}}
The next Ghost Rider, a young man named '''Daniel "Danny" Ketch''' (Johnny Blaze's long lost little brother), debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3, #1 (May 1990). This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous, although his costume was now a black leather [[leather jacket|biker jacket]] with spiked shoulder-pads, grey leather pants, and a mystic chain he wore across his chest, which responded to his mental commands and served as his primary melee weapon. His new motorcycle resembled a futuristic machine and the front of it could lower to serve as a battering ram. Like the original Ghost Rider's bike, the wheels were composed of mystic hellfire. Unlike the relationship between the previous Ghost Rider and the demon with which he was bonded, Ketch and his demon—who in vol. 2, #91 (December 1997) is revealed to be Marvel's incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgment—are cooperative with each other. At the close of the series with vol. 2, #93 (Feb. 1998), Ketch apparently died. The following year, however, ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man#Volume One (1990-1998)|Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #93 (July 1999) revealed Ketch was still alive. Nearly a decade later, Marvel published the long-completed final issue as ''Ghost Rider Finale'' (Jan. 2007), which reprints the last issue and the previously unpublished #94.<ref>While the [[trademarked]] cover logo reads ''Ghost Rider'' #94, the comic's postal [[indicia (publishing)|indicia]] lists the comic [[copyrighted]] as ''Ghost Rider Finale''.</ref>

===Alejandra Jones===
During the 2011 storyline "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]", a Nicaraguan woman named '''Alejandra Jones''' becomes Ghost Rider through a ritual performed by a man named Adam. Though she demonstrates many previously unknown powers of the Ghost Rider entity, she is deprived of its full power when Johnny Blaze takes back most of this power.{{issue|date=May 2018}}

===Robbie Reyes===
{{main|Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)}}
In 2013, a new character took on the ''Ghost Rider'' mantle: a [[Mexican-American]] resident of [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] named '''Roberto "Robbie" Reyes''', who drives a black classic muscle car reminiscent of a modified [[1969 Dodge Charger]] rather than a motorcycle.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=59484]</ref><ref>Montgomery (October 13, 2013).

===1,000,000 B.C. version===
Due to the Celestial Progenitor presence influencing human evolution, in 1,000,000 B.C., certain humans became much more intelligent than others as well as able to speak a new language. However, they had to hide that gift from their brethren for fear of being ostracized. One day, a boy that was gifted with the ability to speak is approached by a mysterious stranger that also possessed that gift, only to witness the stranger transform into a beast and devour his entire tribe. The stranger allowed the boy to live and names him "Ghost" before telling him to challenge him when he is worthy. The boy was forced to survive on his own, though he does befriend a woolly mammoth. After almost dying in the harsh environment, he is approached by Mephisto in the form of a snake, who tells him to say its name. Ghost does that and is bonded with a Spirit of Vengeance; after which he imbued his newly acquired hellfire into the mammoth. Other humans had never seen someone ride an animal before and began referring to Ghost as "The Rider". The Rider continued his search and five years later, eventually caught up with the man who devoured his tribe. The man transformed once more, revealing himself to be the first [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]]. During the fight, the Rider took the bones of the dead that Wendigo had killed and used them to form a weapon; the earliest version of Ghost Rider’s signature chain. The Rider fought Wendigo until finally it and the Rider’s woolly mammoth tumbled over a cliff. Afterwards, Ghost was approached by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] and [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Lady Phoenix]] to join the prehistoric version of the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Upon imbuing his hellfire into another woolly mammoth, Ghost Rider assisted the prehistoric Avengers (consisting of [[Agamotto]], Odin, Lady Phoenix, and prehistoric versions of [[Black Panther (comics)#1,000,000 B.C.|Black Panther]], [[Iron Fist (comics)#Fan Fei|Iron Fist]], and [[Star Brand#1,000,000 B.C. version|Star Brand]]) in fighting an out of control Celestial called the Fallen; which resulted in his woolly mammoth getting killed in action. Ghost Rider swore revenge and assisted his teammates in defeating the Fallen and sealing it away underground in what would become South Africa.<ref>''Marvel Legacy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ghost Rider later assisted the prehistoric Avengers in fighting the First Host.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Ghost Rider is a human who can transform into a skeletal superhuman wreathed in ethereal flame and given supernatural powers. The motorcycle he rides can travel faster than any conventional vehicle and can perform seemingly impossible feats such as riding up a vertical surface, across water, and leaping across great distances that normal motorcycles cannot. The Ghost Riders are virtually indestructible and notoriously hard to injure by any conventional means, as bullets and knives usually pass through them without causing pain (knives are shown to melt while in their body).<ref>''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)]]''</ref> It is possible that they are genuinely immortal, as it is said that God created them and only God can destroy them.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heavens On Fire'' #6</ref> Despite being composed of bone and hellfire, the Ghost Riders possess formidable superhuman strength, enough to easily pick up a truck and hurl it across a road. It has been stated that Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider can press around 25 tons (50,000&nbsp; lbs) (or more as seen in [[World War Hulk]]).<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #4</ref>

Each Ghost Rider entity also had abilities specific to him or her.

; [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]: Originally when Blaze transformed into Ghost Rider, his body changed but not the clothes he was wearing. In his new incarnation, this is different and his clothes take on a different appearance with a spiked leather jacket and chains. As Ghost Rider, he can cause his motorcycle to transform and surround itself with hellfire or he can create a new cycle from pure hellfire. He is also capable of projecting hellfire as a weapon. His hellfire "burns the soul" without leaving physical injuries on the victim and its effects have been seen as similar to the "Penance Stare." In his new incarnation, Blaze is now possibly the most powerful hero on Earth. During "World War Hulk", it was stated by [[Doctor Strange]] that Ghost Rider might be equally as powerful as the "Green Scar" persona of [[Hulk]] and could possibly defeat him. During this series, Doctor Strange also states that Ghost Rider protects only the innocent, which none of the Illuminati are. In recent comics, Blaze's Ghost Rider has been given the "Penance Stare" and mystical chain, both of which were specific to the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider. Blaze also uses a shotgun and discovered that he can discharge hellfire from the weapon when he first encountered Ketch. Now, he also has new abilities including hellfire breath, the ability to produce chains from either his throat or chest, and the ability to travel between incorporeal realms.

; [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]]: When Ketch transformed into Ghost Rider, his clothes changed with him, taking on the appearance of a spiked leather jacket with chains, gray leather pants, and spiked gloves and boots. Likewise, his motorcycle underwent a radical transformation, changing from a conventional one into a high-tech motorcycle (this transformation was not strictly limited to the motorcycle he was found in the cemetery with as he was once seen able to transform another cycle in "Ghost Rider/Wolverine/Punisher: Hearts of Darkness"). Along with flaming wheels that allow the bike to nearly fly across surfaces, the bike included a shield-like battering ram on the front. As the Ghost Rider, Ketch used a mystical chain which responded to his mental commands. It could grow in length, alter direction while in the air, stiffen into a staff or spear, and separate into several links which can strike like shrapnel and then return to their original form. Daniel's most famous power was the ''Penance Stare.'' By locking eyes with a target and mentally focusing, the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider was able to make the target experience all the pain they had ever inflicted on anyone else. However, some beings have shown resistance to this ability, such as [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] as their alien [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] "costumes" do not technically have eyes; and [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]] who is so [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]], he claims to enjoy the experience. In the 1994 Fantastic Four animated series, this ability was shown to be powerful enough to bring down the mighty Galactus, as Ghost Rider forced Galactus to feel the pain of all those who had died as a result of his feeding on their planets; as Ghost Rider put it, "A billion souls". This display of power, though, appeared to simply be a rewrite for the animated series, as the original storyline in ''Fantastic Four'' issue 243 has Doctor Strange casting a spell that causes all of the souls of those Galactus had killed by his feedings to be visited upon him at once. Originally, this incarnation of the Ghost Rider could only be summoned if Danny was present when "innocent blood was spilled" (an innocent simply being threatened was not enough), at which time Danny had to touch the gas cap of his motorcycle for the transformation process to occur. Later, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider without touching the gas cap but still needed to wait for innocent blood to be spilled. Later still, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider by willpower alone.

; [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]]: The ghost of Eli Morrow that inhabits Robbie's body is not, according to Johnny Blaze, a true Spirit of Vengeance. Regardless, he gives Robbie several abilities similar to that of other Ghost Riders, including the power to manifest and control chains ending in thin knives or sickles.<ref>''All New Ghost Rider'' #5</ref> The black muscle car that Morrow's ghost initially inhabits is linked to Robbie's Ghost Rider form, allowing him to instantly teleport to and/or merge with the car. The car can also be driven remotely, and Robbie's Ghost Rider form can pass harmlessly through it, allowing it to drive into foes. The car's trunk, when opened, acts as a portal, allowing the Ghost Rider to transport anything, including people, to any location. Though it is initially unknown if Robbie's Ghost Rider form possesses the divine powers of his predecessors, he eventually displays the ability to use the Penance Stare during a battle with [[Star Brand]].<ref>''Marvel Legacy'' #1</ref> Eli is able to take full control of Robbie's body when the teen gives in to his negative emotions, signified by a pallid skin tone and both of his eyes turning orange. His Ghost Rider form also displays the ability to change into a more powerful and demonic form when Robbie is sufficiently angered.<ref>''Robbie Reyes: Ghost Rider'' #5</ref> At the end of [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s fourth season, to prevent the [[Darkhold]] from being used again, he slung his flaming chains in the same manner as a [[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Sling Ring]], allowing him to travel the Multiverse and take the book with him for safekeeping.

==Other Spirits of Vengeance==

===Vengeance===
{{main|Vengeance (comics)}}
'''Michael Badilino''', an ex-member of the [[New York City Police Department]], is one-third of an "Organic Medallion of Power"; the other two are Ketch and Blaze (the Medallion itself was never explained in any true detail). He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, although he also possesses the Penance Stare and his motorcycle seemed to share characteristics with the Noble Kale version. His appearance is distinguished by a deep purple skull, large fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and backswept curved horns on the top of his skull.

In his superhuman form, Badilino was called '''Vengeance''', and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos. Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. Vengeance would also take on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by that name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen. Vengeance killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire, the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider.

Vengeance reappears in the last four issues of ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, involved in [[Blackheart]]'s plans to kill Noble Kale. Vengeance aids the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, destroying Blackheart and ruling Hell during Ketch's absences.

===The Last Stand of the Spirits of Vengeance===
Seven riders show their flaming heads for the first time in this story arc by writer Jason Aaron and artist Tan Eng Huat.  Daniel Ketch returns with a new mission: to collect the powers of all the Ghost Riders for the angel Zadkiel to prevent the corruption of the powers with their human hosts. Zadkiel has other motives he keeps to himself, of which he needs the powers of the riders to tear down the walls of New Jerusalem and wage war on the heavens.

===''Trail of Tears''===
A version of Ghost Rider appeared in the [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears'' #1–6 (April–Sept. 2007) by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Clayton Crain]]. Set during the [[American Civil War]], it finds Confederate officer '''Travis Parham''' avenging the murders of his friend, an ex-slave named Caleb and Caleb's family. Parham meets a horse-riding Ghost Rider who seeks the same men. Eventually, Parham learns about the deaths instrumental in helping set forth the Spirit of Vengeance.

At first he was reluctant, but when battling his father's killers, he accepted the offer and became '''Ghost Panther''' and battled Erik Killraven (fusion of [[Erik Killmonger]] and [[Killraven]]), while riding a burning Panther.<ref>''Infinity Warps Ghost Panther'' #1-2.

==== Marvel Cinematic Universe ====
{{Main|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4) #Ghost Rider}}
* In July 2016, it was announced that Ghost Rider would make his [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] debut in the fourth season of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''. Marketing had teased at the introduction of the Spirit of Vengeance, and the studio confirmed via San Diego Comic-Con, that the Ghost Rider would feature heavily in the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/comic-con-agents-shield-ghost-912246|title=Comic-Con: 'Agents of SHIELD' Casts Ghost Rider for Season 4|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Bucksbaum|first=Sydney|date=July 22, 2016}}</ref> The [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]] incarnation of the Ghost Rider, portrayed by actor [[Gabriel Luna]], features as a recurring character in season four; influencing the season's marketing subtitle, ''Ghost Rider''; which later became known as the first of three 'Pods' of the season; a new feature for the television series. [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider]] is referenced throughout the season, and has a cameo in the episode "The Good Samaritan". Blaze rescues Reyes and his brother from a car accident caused by gang members and revives the former from the dead by giving Reyes the supernatural abilities of the Spirit of Vengeance. As Robbie only saw Johnny in his Ghost Rider form, he believes that he sold his soul to "The Devil". While Blaze is not named explicitly in the episode, series star [[Clark Gregg]] confirmed the character's identity via his Twitter account.<ref>https://mobile.twitter.com/clarkgregg/status/793643510876352512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fscreencrush.com%2Fagents-of-shield-johnny-blaze-ghost-rider-confirmed%2F</ref> [[Al MacKenzie|Mack]] becomes host to the Ghost Rider for a time after Reyes becomes trapped between dimensions and the Spirit of Vengeance temporarily separated from him. In the season finale, [[Phil Coulson]] briefly becomes the Ghost Rider as part of a trap to defeat the season's primary antagonist, [[List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters#Aida "Ophelia" / Madame Hydra|AIDA / Ophelia / Madame Hydra]].
* In October 2016, Luna discussed that there are plans for Reyes to feature in his own television series, following his introduction in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/videos/2016/10/08/ghost-rider-actor-says-there-are-rumblings-hell-get-his-own-show-nycc-2016|title=Ghost Rider actor says there are rumblings he'll get his own show|website=ign|accessdate=July 20, 2018}}</ref> In later interviews, the actor stated he hopes [[Norman Reedus]] would portray Johnny Blaze in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/agents-of-shields-gabriel-luna-norman-reedus-johnny-blaze/|title=Agents of Shields Gabriel Luna wants Norman Reedus as Johnny Blaze|website=screenrant|accessdate=July 20, 2018}}</ref>

==== Animation ====
* In the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' first-season finale, [[Professor X]] scans [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'s memories and sees Ghost Rider, apparently approaching Gambit.
* The Danny Ketch version of Ghost Rider appeared in the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode "When Calls Galactus" voiced by [[Richard Grieco]]. He helps the Fantastic Four and Thor when Galactus plans to feed on Earth.
* The Danny Ketch version of Ghost Rider appears in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' animated series on [[United Paramount Network|UPN]], voiced by Richard Grieco. It was due to his usage in the UPN cartoons that caused a planned appearance on ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' to be rejected. The episode would have pitted Ghost Rider and Spider-Man against [[Mysterio]] and [[Dormammu]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Allegedly, these two appearances were also meant to serve as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a potential "Ghost Rider" animated series.<ref>http://marvel.toonzone.net/retrospective/ghostrider/</ref>
* The Johnny Blaze version of Ghost Rider appears in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Spirit of Vengeance", voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Spirit of Vengeance|series=Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=24|airdate=June 14, 2015}}</ref> This version is able to haunt and take control vehicles of all sizes, visualized by the vehicles catching fire and allowing weapons, such as some tanks he took over, to shoot fireballs. Unlike other versions of the Ghost Rider, this one could generate electricity and lightning from blue fire, as well as create a vortex of lightning that cured Abomination of his gamma and transformed him back into a human. However, like other versions, this one was able to make portals to other dimensions to appear on walls and other surfaces, such as a mountainside.
* An army of unidentified Ghost Riders appear in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode "The Wastelands." They are led by Ares in his plot to keep the Avengers, the New Avengers, Doctor Strange, and Loki from activating the Bifrost Bridge in order to end the Beyonder's experiment.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Wastelands|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=24|airdate=March 11, 2018}}</ref>

* Nicolas Cage reprised the role in a sequel, ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]'' (2012). Here the character is recruited by a sect to save a boy named [[Danny Ketch|Danny]] from being possessed by Roarke (a form of Mephistopheles who is also his father) while fighting [[Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]].
* In May 2013, the film rights to Ghost Rider reverted to [[Marvel Studios]] from [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]], although it was also confirmed that there were no immediate plans to produce another film featuring the character in the immediate future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/ghost-rider-movie-rights-marvel-punisher-blade-daredevil/ |title='Ghost Rider' Movie Rights Return to Marvel – Will We See a Reboot Soon? |work=screenrant.com |date=2013-05-02 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>
