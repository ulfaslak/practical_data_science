Rom appeared in the [[American comic book]] ''Rom: Spaceknight'' (December 1979 – February 1986) by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Sal Buscema]], and published by [[Marvel Comics]].

In July 2015, [[IDW Publishing]] began publishing a new ''Rom'' comic book series.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.newsarama.com/25138-rom-and-micronauts-finally-return-but-not-where-you-think.html|title= Rom and Micronauts Finally Return...

==Publication history==

===Toy===
"Rom" was a toy co-created by Scott Dankman, Richard C. Levy, and Bryan L. McCoy (US Patent #4,267,551).<ref>{{Citation| inventor-last = Dankman| inventor-first = Scott| inventor2-last = Levy| inventor2-first = Richard C.| inventor3-last = McCoy| inventor3-first = Bryan L.| publication-date = December 7, 1978| issue-date = May 12, 1981| title = Multi-mode doll| country-code = US| patent-number = 4267551}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsrchnum.htm&Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&r=1&l=50&f=G&d=PALL&s1=4267551.PN.&OS=PN/4267551&RS=PN/4267551|title= Multi-mode doll |first1= Scott|last1= Dankman|first2= Richard C.|last2= Levy|first3= Bryan L.|last3= McCoy|date= May 12, 1981|publisher= [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|deadurl= no |accessdate= February 24, 2013|quote=  }}</ref> It was sold to [[Parker Brothers]], and was the inspiration<ref name="Interview-McCoy" /> for the [[comic book]] series '''''Rom: Spaceknight'''''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->. The toy was originally named [[COBOL]], after the programming language, but was later changed to "Rom", after [[Read-only memory|ROM]] (read-only memory), by Parker Brothers executives.<ref name="Interview-McCoy" />

The toy set a precedent for the game publishing company, which up until that time had only ever produced [[board games]]. As this was a new venture for the company, and given that electronic toys were still very new, a decision was made to produce the figure as cheaply as possible. As a result, the final product had very few points of articulation, and twin red [[LED]]s served as Rom's eyes instead of the originally envisioned green, which were more expensive to produce.<ref name="Interview-McCoy">{{cite web |url= http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/comics/Rom/actionfig/mccoy.shtml|title= An Interview with Bing McCoy|first= Lee K.|last= Seitz|date= January 4, 2006|publisher= Rom Spaceknight Revisted!|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6EgAG51nc|archivedate= February 24, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= March 25, 2007}}</ref>

Not long after its debut, Rom appeared in the corner box of the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's December 10, 1979, issue.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title = Those Thinking Toys|date = December 10, 1979|url = http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19791210,00.html|accessdate = February 24, 2013}}</ref> It was featured in the interior article, "Those Beeping, Thinking Toys," which decried Rom's lack of articulation and predicted it would "end up among the dust balls under the playroom sofa."<ref>{{cite journal|last = Skow|first = John|title = Those Beeping, Thinking Toys|magazine = Time|pages = |date = December 10, 1979|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912568,00.html|accessdate = March 11, 2007}}</ref>

Rom was licensed to [[Palitoy]] in the United Kingdom to extend the "Space Adventurer" line of [[Action Man]], appearing in their 1980 catalog.

Around the 2017 [[San Diego Comic Con]], a new action figure of Rom was released for the convention and at HasbroToyShop.com in limited quantities as part of the [[IDW Publishing| IDW]] [[Hasbro Universe| Revolution]] set alongside figures of [[Jetfire (Transformers)| Jetfire]] (a repaint of the previously released Transformers Thrilling 30/Legends LG-07 Leader Class Jetfire figure), [[List of G.I. Joe characters| Roadblock]], [[Action Man]], [[Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light| Leoric]], characters from the [[Micronauts]], a [[Dire Wraith]] and [[Matt Trakker]].

===Comic book series===
To build interest in the toy, Parker Brothers licensed the character to [[Marvel Comics]], which created a  comic book featuring Rom. The comic expanded on the premise that Rom was a [[cyborg]] and gave him an origin, personality, set of supporting characters and villains, as well as interaction within the [[Marvel Universe]]. The comic was written by [[Bill Mantlo]] and initially illustrated by artist [[Sal Buscema]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 191|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Prolific writer Bill Mantlo and artist Sal Buscema created a Marvel comics series and a whole mythology around Parker Brothers' toy 'ROM'.}}</ref> Buscema stated in a 2010 interview, "I liked the character. And I liked what they did with it. I thought the concept was quite good. It was unique. It made it attractive to do. I almost hate to say this, but it was pretty easy to draw, too."<ref>{{cite book|last = Amash|first = Jim|title = Sal Buscema: Comics' Fast & Furious Artist|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year = 2010|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|page = 57|isbn = 978-1605490212}}</ref> Buscema was the main artist for the series from its creation through 1984. [[Steve Ditko]] took over for the final two years of the original run.

Ultimately, the toy failed and only sold 200,000 to 300,000 units<!--this is quite a large range--> in the US, with creator McCoy blaming the failure on poor packaging and marketing.<ref name="Interview-McCoy"/> Parker Brothers subsequently abandoned the line.

The comic book outlasted the toy which it was created to support. The series lasted for 75 issues (not including the four annual issues) from December 1979 to February 1986. Rom's regular encounters with mainstream heroes and villains established him as part of Marvel continuity.<ref name="Rom-1-75">{{gcdb series|id= 2516|title= Rom}} and {{gcdb series|id= 2662|title= Rom Annual}}</ref>

On May 7, 2016, having licensed the character from Parker Brothers' parent company, [[Hasbro]], [[IDW Publishing]] debuted a brand new ''Rom'' #0 as part of [[Free Comic Book Day]].  The free issue serves as a prologue to a new ongoing series which began in July 2016.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 104631|title= Rom ''(IDW Publishing)''}}</ref>

In the comic book, Rom is more than a simple cyborg, being originally from a utopian society on the planet Galador. The series details Rom's defeat of the invading [[Dire Wraith]] alien race, and the continuation of their battle on Earth and other planets.<ref name="Rom-1-75"/>  Unlike the technologically advanced Galadorian civilization, the Dire Wraiths rely primarily on dark magic and their power to change their appearance.

Some years before Rom's arrival on Earth, Galador is threatened by a fleet of ships manned by the Dire Wraiths. Galador's ruler, the Prime Director, calls for volunteers to be transformed into [[Spaceknights]], [[cyborg]] warriors that can defend the planet from the invaders. The volunteers are promised that their "humanity" (the body parts that would be removed to accommodate the bionic armor) would be preserved and restored to them after the danger was over. Rom was the first to volunteer, and was transformed into a large, silver humanoid that at first glance appeared to be totally robotic. Rom was given Galador's greatest weapon - the Neutralizer -  which on one setting could banish the Wraiths into the [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] dimension forever. Inspired by his example, a total of 1,000 Galadorians volunteered and were transformed into Spaceknights, each with his or her own unique armor, powers and code names.<ref name="Rom">{{cite comic| writer= [[Bill Mantlo|Mantlo, Bill]]|penciller= [[Sal Buscema|Buscema, Sal]]|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= Arrival!|title= Rom|issue= 1|date= December 1979}}</ref>

The Spaceknights succeeded in stopping the Dire Wraith invasion, although Rom decided to follow the remnants of the fleet back to their home planet – Wraithworld – which orbited a black sun. The Dire Wraiths panicked, and after a futile counter-attack abandoned the planet and scattered throughout space.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= [[Ian Akin|Akin, Ian]]; [[Brian Garvey (comics)|Garvey, Brian]]|story= To Save a Spaceknight!|title= Rom Annual|issue= 2|date= 1983}}</ref> Unable to stop Rom, the Dire Wraiths successfully used their sorcery to trick him into allowing their escape.  Rom now felt responsible for spreading the Dire Wraiths' evil across the universe, and swore he would not reclaim his humanity until all Dire Wraiths had been vanquished. His fellow Spaceknights, including comrades [[Starshine (comics)|Starshine]] and [[Terminator (Marvel Comics)|Terminator]], swore the same oath and left Galador.<ref name="Rom"/>

====Earthfall====
Rom arrives on Earth 200 years later, and it is at this point that the ''Rom'' series begins. Landing near the fictional town of Clairton, in West Virginia, United States, Rom encounters Brandy Clark. After seeing Rom deal with the Dire Wraiths firsthand, the young woman comes to understand his mission and helps to hide Rom from prying eyes. This becomes necessary once Rom uses the Neutralizer in public, as witnesses only see a "killer robot" disintegrating innocents - they do not realize that Rom is in fact banishing Dire Wraiths in human form. In time, Steve Jackson helps Rom in his mission, but Brandy began to fall in love with the noble Rom thus Brandy's relationship with Steve was strained.<ref name="Rom"/>

During his time on Earth, Rom fights and banishes thousands of Dire Wraiths. The increasingly desperate Dire Wraiths create new foes for Rom, such as Firefall - a fusion of human and Spaceknight;<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= The Fire, the Friend, and the Foe!|title= Rom|issue= 4|date= March 1980}}</ref> the sorcerous Hellhounds;<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= Dog Day Afternoon!|title= Rom|issue= 6|date= May 1980}}</ref> and robotic Watchwraiths.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=  Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= The Watchwraith!|title= Rom|issue= 16|date= March 1981}}</ref> Two of Rom's greatest foes are the aptly named Hybrid<ref name="Rom17" /><ref name="Rom18" /><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= [[Joe Sinnott|Sinnott, Joe]]|story= West Virginia REEL|title= Rom|issue= 31|date= June 1982}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer=  Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= Choosing Sides|title= Rom|issue= 32|date= July 1982}}</ref> (a hideous result of a union between Wraith and human), and Mentus (a suit of Spaceknight armor occupied by the dark side of the Prime Director's psyche).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= Galador!|title= Rom|issue= 25|date= December 1981}}</ref> Many other opponents were more traditional and hailed from the Marvel Universe proper, such as the [[Mad Thinker]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= The Ultimate Android!|title= Rom|issue= 14|date= January 1981}}</ref> the [[Space Phantom]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Buscema, Sal|story= Limbo!|title= Rom|issue= 19|date= June 1981}}</ref> and [[Galactus]] and his then-herald [[Terrax]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= Galactus!|title= Rom|issue= 26|date= January 1982}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= Turnabout is Fair Play!|title= Rom|issue= 27|date= February 1982}}</ref> He encountered such heroes as the [[X-Men]],<ref name="Rom17">{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker=  Buscema, Sal|story= Hybrid!|title= Rom|issue= 17|date= April 1981}}</ref><ref name="Rom18">{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]; [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]]; Buscema, Sal|story= And a Child Shall Deceive Them!|title= Rom|issue= 18|date= May 1981}}</ref> [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jo Duffy|Duffy, Mary Jo]]|penciller= [[Greg LaRocque|LaRocque, Greg]]|inker= [[Ricardo Villamonte|Villamonte, Ricardo]]|story= Wraith, Color Or Creed|title= [[Power Man and Iron Fist]]|issue= 73|date= September 1981}}</ref> the [[Fantastic Four]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= The Thing from Outer Space!|title= Rom|issue= 23|date= October 1981}}</ref> [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= No Place Like Home!|title= Rom|issue= 24|date= November 1981}}</ref> the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= [[Bob Hall (comics)|Hall, Bob]]|inker= [[Kevin Dzuban|Dzuban, Kevin]]|story= SSHSSS|title= [[Marvel Two-in-One]]|issue= 99|date= May 1983}}</ref> and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= [[Gerry Talaoc|Talaoc, Gerry]]|story= To Kill or Cure!|title= [[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]|volume= 2|issue= 296|date= June 1984}}</ref> Rom was one of the many heroes transported into an arena in space for the Contest of Champions, though he was not chosen to participate.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Gruenwald|Gruenwald, Mark]]; Mantlo, Bill; [[Steven Grant|Grant, Steven]]|penciller= [[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]]|inker= [[Pablo Marcos|Marcos, Pablo]]; [[Bob Layton|Layton, Bob]]|story= A Gathering of Heroes!|title= [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions]]|issue= 1|date= June 1982}}</ref>

At one stage, Rom's war against the Dire Wraiths takes a turn for the worse - a new breed appeared on Earth, and appeared to be far deadlier than the first variety.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Akin, Ian; Garvey, Brian|story= One Man's Toys...

Unlike the males, the female Dire Wraiths chose not to act in secrecy and openly attack Clairton while Rom is away, killing everyone (including Steve and superhero ally [[Torpedo (Marvel Comics)|the Torpedo]]) with the exception of Brandy. Furthermore, they attack [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Helicarrier|mobile headquarters]] which gave Earth authorities clear evidence of the Dire Wraiths' existence and threat.

====Endgame====
Rom leaves Earth soon after the battle and returns to Galador. Unknown to Rom, Brandy had accidentally met the entity called the [[Beyonder (comics)|Beyonder]], and Brandy asked to be transported to Galador.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Layton, Bob|story= When You Wish Upon a Star|title= Rom|issue= 72|date= November 1985}}</ref> The Beyonder complied and Brandy found herself on Galador, now a war-torn world occupied by a new generation of cyborg-Spaceknights. Created to defend Galador in the absence of the first Spaceknights, this next generation of cyborgs became corrupted by their power, and feeling superior to normal Galadorians, massacred the entire race.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= Strangers in Paradise!|title= Rom|issue= 73|date= December 1985}}</ref> In an act of sheer spite, the new Spaceknights destroyed the frozen remains of the originals. Rom arrived too late and could only save Brandy.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|story= |title= Rom|issue= 74|date= January 1986}}</ref> Enraged, Rom summoned the original Spaceknights and together they destroyed the traitors. Rom then made a surprising discovery - his original humanity persisted within the entombed body of Terminator. Reclaiming it, Rom became human again and finally admitted his love for Brandy. The two chose to remain on Galador, with the intent of repopulating the planet. The remaining Spaceknights, their humanity now lost, set out to explore the universe, except for a few others that remained on Galador to protect Rom and Brandy.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Ditko, Steve|inker= Russell, P. Craig|story= The End!|title= Rom|issue= 75|date= February 1986}}</ref>

During [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]'s wedding to [[Marlo Chandler]], the human Rom returned to Earth, together with Brandy, as guests at the ceremony, and Rom greeted the Hulk with a friendly handshake.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Peter David|David, Peter]]|penciller= [[Gary Frank|Frank, Gary]]|inker= [[Cam Smith|Smith, Cam]]|story= We Are Gathered Here|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 418|date= June 1994}}</ref>

====Spaceknights miniseries====
In the ''Spaceknights'' miniseries  (Oct. 2000 – Feb. 2001) written by [[Jim Starlin]] it is revealed that Rom took the name Artour (a reference to Brandy's love of Arthurian legends, and perhaps in memory of his own encounter with King Arthur's ghost)<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Akin, Ian; Garvey, Brian|story= In Days of Olde, When Knights Were Bolde!|title= Rom|issue= 37|date= December 1982}}</ref> and that he and Brandy had two sons.<ref name="Spaceknights1">{{cite comic| writer= [[Chris Batista|Batista, Chris]]; [[Jim Starlin|Starlin, Jim]]|penciller= Batista, Chris|inker= [[Chip Wallace|Wallace, Chip]]|story= Ebon Tidings|title= Spaceknights|issue= 1|date= October 2000}}</ref> Rom himself is not actually seen in the series, nor is he mentioned by that name or shown in his spaceknight form (no doubt to skirt the fact that Marvel no longer held the license from Parker Brothers, which had retained the copyrights on Rom's name and armored likeness); his ship is attacked off-panel just prior to the start of the story, with Rom himself missing and presumed dead.<ref name="Spaceknights1" />

==Powers and abilities==
Rom's armor was composed of the Galadorian metal '''plandanium'''.  It is extremely durable, even going so far as to stand up to [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine's]] [[adamantium]] claws. It was shown to be damaged from time to time, demonstrating that plandanium is not indestructible. The armor had self-repair capabilities, though it took several weeks to repair major damage. It provided him with superhuman strength, flight, and the ability to travel through [[outer space|space]] via backpack rockets. It allowed him to breathe in any [[atmosphere]] and survive in the vacuum of space. In Spaceknight form, Rom also did not need to eat or sleep. Controls near the torso allowed Rom to lower the armor's temperature to well below zero. The armor stored a "solar charge" that could be used as a weapon and could drain power sources by mere contact. It gave him the ability to summon three pieces of equipment stored in "[[Hyperspace (science fiction)|subspace]]":
;'''Neutralizer''' : Rom's primary weapon, which is designed to banish Dire Wraiths to Limbo by opening a dimensional portal. Unfortunately, the process leaves considerable waste material (ash, etc.) that makes it appear to an uninformed observer that the weapon kills its target. In addition, the Dire Wraiths unsuccessfully explored the possibility of examining the weapon to find some means of returning its victims to the normal dimension. This handheld weapon could fire energy beams that can be deadly at a high setting if Rom chose to select it and it can neutralize various forms of energy. This device was designed so that only Rom would be able to discharge it. The mutant Wolverine once tried to use the weapon and received a numbing blast of energy feedback.<ref name="Rom18" /> Rom's Neutralizer would inspire a similar creation by the mutant [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] when the US government tasked him with constructing a weapon against the Wraith horde. Forge's neutralizer, for a time, cost [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] her mutant abilities.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Claremont, Chris|penciller= Romita Jr., John|inker= Green, Dan|story= Public Enemy!|title= The Uncanny X-Men|issue= 185|date= September 1984}}</ref>
;'''Analyzer''' : Allowed Rom to see shape-changing Dire Wraiths in their true form and could assess the energy and potential of any object/entity. It could be used on an item which represented a world, such as a globe, and would display lights corresponding to Dire Wraith infestations at that point on the planet. Unfortunately, the device resembles a handgun, and Dire Wraith imposters have taken advantage of this fact to fool others into thinking that Rom is attacking them. Rom once arranged an ally to have the equivalent kind of vision, but the Dire Wraiths counteracted that by magically blocking his mind from recognizing that particular visual data. Regardless, Rom allowed [[SHIELD]] to examine the Analyzer in hope of creating equivalent devices among the Spaceknight's human allies.
In the new "Rom" series by IDW, his energy Analyzer is represented as two red lenses mounted on his arms. The arms transform to reveal the lenses, which emit a red light when in operation.
;'''Universal Translator''' : Allowed Rom to instantly learn the language of any creature, irrespective of their origin. This device was used to scan and store printed information from an encyclopedia in Rom's [[memory bank]]s for future use. 
In the IDW series, the Translator is not a separate piece of equipment, but a function of Rom himself. When he first speaks, he uses an alien language before shifting to English, seemingly mid-sentence.

==Other versions==

As Marvel Comics no longer possesses the licensing rights to Rom from Parker Brothers, the character is not allowed to appear in his armored form. Marvel has found ways to work around this dilemma.
*In 2000, Marvel published a five-issue ''SpaceKnights'' series which featured a hero named Prince Tristan (codenamed "Liberator") in a redesigned version of Rom's armor.  He fought alongside other SpaceKnights named after some of the more popular ones from the original series.
*In the ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)#Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'' series featuring [[Genis-Vell]], Rick Jones was shown to own a toaster in the shape of Rom's helmet.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[ChrisCross]]|inker= [[Anibal Rodriguez (comics)|Rodriguez, Anibal]]|story= First Contact|title= [[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]]|volume= 3|issue= 1|date= January 2000}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= ChrisCross|inker= Rodriguez, Anibal|story= It's A Small Universe After All|title= Captain Marvel|volume= 3|issue= 6|date= June 2000}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[Leonard Kirk|Kirk, Leonard]]|inker= [[Robin Riggs|Riggs, Robin]]|story= Quiet Miracles|title= Captain Marvel|volume= 3|issue= 26|date= February 2002}}</ref>
*In the alternate world of [[Earth X]], Rom had ironically been banished to [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] and was battling against the very Dire Wraiths he had sent there. Rom was seen in human form wielding his Neutralizer and using his chest-plate as a shield. He was referred to only as "the Greatest Spaceknight."<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alex Ross|Ross, Alex]]; [[Jim Krueger|Krueger, Jim]]|penciller= [[Doug Braithwaite|Braithwaite, Doug]]|inker= [[Bill Reinhold|Reinhold, Bill]]|title= [[Earth X#Universe X|Universe X]]|issue= 3|date= December 2000}}</ref>
*In ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #12.1, the super-villain group, The [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]], was seen working with a 'spaceknight' that had actually been a vessel for [[Ultron]] in his digital form, which he proceeds to reconstruct into his own likeness.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller= [[Bryan Hitch|Hitch, Bryan]]|inker= [[Paul Neary|Neary, Paul]]|story= Her name is Jessica Drew, Spider-Woman|title= The Avengers|volume= 4|issue= 12.1|date= June 2011}}</ref>

==Reprint controversies==
Legal issues regarding the reprinting of Rom guest appearances in other comics have led to complications. Brief cameos such as a holographic version of the character appearing as a distraction in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #187 have remained intact as have the Rom entries in the ''[[Essential Marvel]]'' trade paperbacks for the original ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' and its deluxe edition sequel. The cover of the ''Essential Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' removed Rom from the artwork used for the cover of the collection.

Several appearances by Rom have been outright omitted. ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' #73, which featured Rom was omitted from ''Essential Power Man and Iron Fist'' vol. 1, and similarly ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #99 was omitted from ''Essential Marvel Two-in-One'' vol. 4, while ''The Incredible Hulk: Regression'' trade paperback features a heavily edited version of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #296, removing Rom's entire appearance in the issue. Furthermore, ''Rom'' #72, which was a tie-in to the ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' series, was omitted from the ''Secret Wars II Omnibus''.
