'''Magma''' (real name '''Amara Juliana Olivians [[Aquila (Roman)|Aquilla]]'''; also known as '''Alison Crestmere'''<ref>''New Warriors'' #31</ref>) is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was co-created by [[Chris Claremont]], [[John Buscema]], [[Glynis Wein]] and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]], and first appears in the series ''[[New Mutants]]'', and is also associated with various ''[[X-Men]]''-related comics. Like all the other New Mutants, Amara originally appeared as a young mutant aspiring to become a hero. Amara, a mutant with the ability to generate [[lava]], joins the New Mutants and becomes Magma.<ref name="New Mutants #10">''New Mutants'' #10</ref>

==Publication history==
Magma debuted in ''The New Mutants'' #8 (October 1983), appearing in that title regularly through ''The New Mutants'' #57 (November 1987), in which she departs the titular supergroup to join their rivals, the Hellions. Along with the other New Mutants, she appeared as an occasional supporting character in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', with issue #189 (1985) as a salient issue featuring her conflict with [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] at the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. After her being dropped from the regular cast, ''The New Mutants'' featured two Magma solo stories, occupying the entirety of ''The New Mutants'' #62 (April 1988) and ''The New Mutants'' #81 (November 1989). The latter was a fill-in issue written while she was still a regular cast member.<ref>"Report Card" letters page, ''The New Mutants'' #30 (August 1985). This story is mentioned again in the letters page of ''The New Mutants'' #35.</ref>

Magma appeared infrequently during the 1990s, but did take part in the "Child's Play" crossover through ''X-Force'' #32-33 and ''New Warriors'' #45-46 (1994). In ''X-Force'' #87-90 (1997), Magma appeared as an antagonist to her former teammates, but her villainous personality was short-lived as she returned to her affiliation with the X-Men in semi-regular publication in ''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #3-4, #7-8, #11 and #13 (2003-2004) and as a team member in ''X-Treme X-Men'' #34-46 (2004).  Magma then featured prominently as a member of the 198 remaining mutants on earth in the limited series ''X-Men: The 198'' #1-5 (2006) and then in ''Young X-Men'' #1-6 (2008) until returning to regular monthly publication in ''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #1 (2009) wherein she remained as a regular character through issue #50 (2012).

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Magma (Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla) hails from the [[fictional country]] of Nova Roma ([[New Rome]]), a colony of the [[Roman Republic]] reportedly founded shortly after the death of [[Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC. The colony is hidden in the [[Amazon Rainforest]]s of modern [[Brazil]] and was ruled until recently by the immortal witch [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]. Amara is the daughter of Lucius Antonius Aquilla. He was presumably a member of the historical [[gens]] Antonia which claimed descent from Anton, son of [[Hercules]]. Growing up in Nova Roma, she had [[perm (hairstyle)|curly]] [[blond]]e hair, and wore a traditional white Roman [[toga]].

Caught up in a deadly power struggle between Selene and her father, she disguises herself as an [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous Brazilian]], and is captured by the [[New Mutants]], who soon discover her true ethnicity.<ref>''New Mutants'' #8</ref> Her powers manifest after she is abducted by Selene, who throws her into a lava pool.<ref name="New Mutants #10"/> Amara is defeated by Selene, but later rescued by the New Mutants and adopts the name 'Magma' as her heroic identity.<ref name="New Mutants #11">''New Mutants'' #11</ref> At her father's urging, she leaves Nova Roma, in the company of the New Mutants, to be taught by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #12</ref>

===New Mutants===
After the New Mutants visit Nova Roma, Magma officially enters Xavier's school and joins the New Mutants.<ref>''New Mutants'' #13</ref> She invades the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s New York headquarters to battle Selene.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #189</ref> She is fooled into joining a gladiatorial competition run by the insane [[Shadow King]]. She partners with [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]. Eventually, the efforts of her other friends free her and Sunspot from the cult-like control of the games.<ref>''New Mutants'' #29-31 (1985)</ref>

Mistaking the New Mutants for the [[X-Men]], the [[Enchantress (comics)|Enchantress]] kidnaps them during their Greek vacation and takes them to Asgard. The teleportation spell created by her teammate [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] goes awry when blocked by the Enchantress' own power. Thrown through time and space, Magma ends up in the elven realm. They trick her into eating and drinking, thus making her one of their own, body and mind. She participates in a raid on the Asgardian dwarves, where she is defeated by [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]. The dwarves, grateful to Cannonball, restore Magma's mind, but they cannot restore her body. This becomes moot when the team is sent back home, with all magical alterations reversed.<ref>''New Mutants Special Edition'' #1 (December 1985); ''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #9</ref> Some time later, she encounters [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], discovering he is one of the gods she worshiped.<ref>''New Mutants'' #81</ref>

After a time, Magma recognizes her grandmother, "many times removed" in a statue depicting the ancient [[lunar deity]] [[Selene]]. The witch Selene approaches her to claim having been both the model for the statue and the ancestor in question.<ref>'' New Mutants'' #53 (July 1987)</ref> Magma and the New Mutants clash with [[Emma Frost]] and her super-powered teens, the Hellions on multiple occasions. Despite the cruelties displayed by the Hellion [[Empath (comics)|Empath]], Magma develops an attraction towards him. She recognizes this and is distressed by her feelings. Soon after, Magma leaves the New Mutants and joins the Hellions.<ref>''New Mutants'' #56-57</ref>

===Hellions===
She trains with the Hellions, and returns to South America with Empath.<ref>''New Mutants'' #62</ref> She later reveals to the New Mutants that her father arranged her engagement to a South American prince. She is captured by the [[High Evolutionary]]'s agents Dr. Stack and Purge, but is rescued by the New Mutants.<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #4</ref>

It is later revealed that Nova Roma is not Roman, but was created by Selene using mind control on [[United Kingdom|British]] citizens to recreate Rome, and that Magma's real name is Allison Crestmere. While still under the influence of the "Allison" persona, she briefly resurfaces as a member of the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|New Hellions]].

===Return and going===
Later, she is one of the mutants who appears crucified on the [[X-Men]]'s lawn. While she is saved by a transfusion of [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]]'s blood, when she goes to sleep, she lapses into a deep coma.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} She is forcibly revived by [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]], a traumatic event which prompts her to destroy the infirmary and flee in a rage. Further telepathic contact with Magma is rebuffed.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #7 (January 2004)</ref>

===Rejoining the X-Men===
When she eventually arrives in Los Angeles, as Amara once more, she meets up with [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], who had joined a [[X-Treme X-Men|splinter team of X-Men]].<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #34 (2004)</ref> She aids this team for a time, and when the "Allison Crestmere" identity is brought up by Cannonball, Magma reveals that Elixir's healing had removed the "Allison" personality, she now realizes that it was, in fact, a deception.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #46 (2004)</ref>

Amara returns to the school for a while.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #13 (2004)</ref> When her friend [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] had to leave, Magma takes over her advisory role, becoming the leader of the [[Paragons (comics)|Paragons]].<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #15 (2005)</ref>

Magma is part of the [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive]], although she is never seen as taking part of any missions on-panel.

===Post M-Day===
Due to the events of [[House of M]] and the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] of mutants, Magma loses her boyfriend while the two are exploring the inside of a volcano at the exact moment that the depowering wave of the [[Scarlet Witch]] runs across [[Earth]]. His death temporarily drives her insane causing her to make the volcano erupt and attack a nearby town.<ref>"X-Men: The 198" #1-2 (2006)</ref> She is later apprehended by Empath and brought to the Xavier Institute where she shares a tent with [[Skids (comics)|Skids]] and [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]].<ref>"X-Men: The 198" #2 (2006)</ref> She then falls victim to being manipulated by the mutant [[Johnny Dee]] who is infatuated with her. Because of previous experience with being emotionally controlled, she incorrectly blames Empath who denies her accusations.<ref>"X-Men: The 198" #5 (2006)</ref>

===Young X-Men===
Along with former New Mutants, [[Danielle Moonstar]], Cannonball, and Sunspot, Magma appeared to be a member of the newest incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], as claimed by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]].<ref>''Young X-Men'' #1-2</ref> She is one of the first members targeted by the new team of [[Young X-Men|X-Men]], composed primarily of former [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] students.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #2</ref> During the battle, Amara turns [[Dust (comics)|Dust]] into glass by superheating her sand form, shatters [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]] (who later reforms), and is eventually taken out by [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]]. She is held in a holding cell in the custody of Cyclops.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} It is eventually revealed that "Cyclops" is in reality [[Donald Pierce]], the former White King of the Hellfire Club, who is posing as the X-Men leader using an image inducer.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #4</ref> Pierce's reasons for recruiting these "X-Men" is currently unknown, but it was revealed that Pierce utilized the ruse that Magma and her allies formed a new Brotherhood in order to convince the former students to attack their former teachers and allies. She later helps to capture him and then relocates to San Francisco.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #6</ref>

===Reforming the New Mutants===
After receiving an anonymous tip in Colorado about a young mutant endangering a small town, Dani and [[Karma (comics)|Shan]] are sent to investigate and calm the locals. During their mission, Magik reappears back at the X-Men's base in San Francisco after teleporting off into the future after the events of "X-Infernus". Upon her return, Magik informs Sam and Roberto that Shan and Dani are in trouble, a situation that will result in their deaths. Amara is visiting with Empath in his cell when she is called away by Sam. Amara questions as to whether Illyana is the real Illyana. Sam assembles a team of X-Men consisting of himself, Sunspot, Magma, and Magik to go find Dani and Shan. While en route, Illyana asks Magma why she visits Empath in his cell since he tried to kill her friends and asks if she still loves him. Magma stumbles to answer and Magik accuses her of still having feelings for Empath. Magik then tells Magma that she will help cure Empath if Magma wishes and will keep the whole thing a secret from the others.

While searching for Shan and Dani in Colorado, the girls split up and Sam and Roberto come across a tied up and unconscious Shan in the back of a bar, while Magik and Magma are tricked into freeing [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] from a box.<ref name="NM">''New Mutants'', vol. 3 #1</ref> The personalities in Legion's mind want to kill Dani because she can help Legion get them under control.<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 3 #2</ref>  Legion locates Dani in a jail cell and is about to kill her when Sam stops him. Legion is forced outside where he distracts Sam and Sunspot while again trying to kill Dani, only to be stopped by Magma and Magik.<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 3 #3</ref> After Legion takes out Sunspot, Magma attacks Legion, who manages to counter her attacks by making her feel extremely cold, taking her out of the fight.<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 3 #4</ref>

===Utopia===
Magma is mentioned by [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] as one of the first mutants being teleported to Utopia, the X-Men's new island home.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #8</ref> She is later seen alongside [[Match (Marvel Comics)|Match]] during the final fight against [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s forces, throwing fire at [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], as well as lighting a small area on fire around [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] during his fight with Venom.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus'' one-shot</ref>

While she is still recovering from her wounds, Doug arrives to apologize. At first Amara tells him to leave, but he convinces Amara to hear him out by communicating with her in a special language he designed for her. She then thanks him and welcomes him back.<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 3 #9</ref>

Around this time, Mephisto comes to collect on his debt and escorts Magma on their date. Taking Amara to the [[Inferno_(Dante)#Third_Circle_(Gluttony)|third circle of hell]], he goes overboard trying to impress her but Amara becomes overwhelmed; revealing she is too fearful to enjoy the date in case he tries to trick her into another deal.

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Magma (Amara Aquilla) - Vol 1 No 11.png|thumb|left|100px|Magma, when fully lit.]]
Magma is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with [[Geothermal gradient|geothermal]] powers. These grant her control over [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], even to the extent of causing seismic upheaval. Amara's powers allow her to be so in-tune with the Earth, she is able to sense seismic activity and prevent earthquakes before they happen.<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 3 #36</ref> She can also call forth molten rock from the Earth's core, producing projectiles composed of lava,<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 1 #10 (1984)</ref> or miniature [[volcano]]es.<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 1 #14 (1984)</ref> 

When using her powers, Magma typically assumes an energized form that emits intense light and heat. While in this form, Amara can increase the temperature around her to the point where metal weapons melt before inflicting her with any damage.<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 3 #31</ref> On another occasion, she has  demonstrated this ability without assuming her energized form by heating up the room at a Hellfire Club party.<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 1 #53 (1984)</ref>  She can also create orbs of a fire-like substance and use them as projectiles or a source of light. Although Magma has triggered small earth tremors without taking on her energized form, she has never been seen to use her power to control lava while in her ordinary human appearance. On M-Day, she traveled within the heated gases of an active volcano, and demonstrates an immunity to volcanic gases, heat, and flame.<ref>''X-Men: The 198'' #1 (2006)</ref> 

In addition, Amara possesses certain regenerative powers when in contact with the ground. Even when she was once affected by Selene's life-draining touch, she recovered quickly enough to aid the New Mutants in battle.<ref>"New Mutants", vol. 1 #11 (1984)</ref> If she is not in contact with the ground or the physical shock to her system from a single injury is too great, the regenerative power is no longer in effect and she may die.<ref>"New Mutants", vol. 3 #1 (2009)</ref> Dr. Nemesis discovered that Magma is also able to recover from laceration wounds in her human form by changing to her energized form, the intense heat cauterizing and sealing any wounds.<ref>"New Mutants", vol. 3 #19 (2011)</ref> Since the late 2000's, Amara has also displayed the power of flight. However this power has been inconsistently portrayed as in some of her recent appearances in ''X-Men: Gold'' show Magma flying but also being carried around by Rogue and Captain Britain.<ref>''X-Men: Gold'' #25</ref>

Due to her Nova Roman heritage, Magma is well versed in Roman culture, including the Latin language, and is a skilled swordswoman.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Amara, like many other young mutants, is recruited by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and became one of his assassins. Fanatical and in total control of her powers, Magma is sent to London to eliminate the leadership of the Human High Council. The attack is foiled by [[Wolverine (character)|Weapon X]] (Logan), who kills Amara. The assassination attempt is actually a provocation on Apocalypse's behalf, who wants the Council to amass its fleets, making them more vulnerable to be destroyed.<ref>''Weapon X'' #1</ref>

===Age of X===
In the reality known as the Age of X, Magma came from Brazil via Mexico to join Magneto in Nevada.<ref name="AGE OF X COMMUNIQUÉS: Frenzy, Magma, Cypher">{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Dave|date=2011-01-26|accessdate=2012-06-07|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|title=AGE OF X COMMUNIQUÉS: Frenzy, Magma, Cypher|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=30528}}</ref> She later joined [[New Mutants|Moonstar's Cadre]] in protecting and hunting down any person of interest.{{issue|date=January 2019}}

===Days of Future Past===
In an alternate version of the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' future, a war between mutants and baseline humans, started by the latter, results in a mutant victory thanks to an alliance between Xavier's Institute and the Hellfire Club. Magma and Sunspot become the Chief Arbitrators of the Lords Cardinal, and create an idyllic state for mutants, while regular humans are left to fend for themselves. Mutants born to baseline humans are taken from their parents and those who oppose Magma and Sunspot are brainwashed by the Hellfire Club's agents.<ref>''New Mutants'' #49-50 (March, April 1987)</ref>

===X-Men: The End===
Magma is seen fighting alongside the other X-Men against the Warskrulls who invade the mansion.<ref>''X-Men: The End'' #2 (2005)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
Ultimate Magma is featured as a former mutant prisoner of Camp: Angel and joined [[Kitty Pryde]]'s resistance in the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' title, ''[[Ultimate Comics: X-Men]]''.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #19 (2010)</ref> She is later seen as part of a re-formed X-Men team, looking to leave Manhattan because Galactus is attacking. However the entire X-Men team is recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. who need mainly Kitty.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates Last Stand'' #4 (2014)</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* In the cartoon ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', Magma is an young teenage [[Afro-Brazilian]] student with no apparent connection to Nova Roma, and a member of the X-Men subset known as the New Mutants. She is a rather shy and insecure girl, though with a quite fiery temper if she ever gets angry, and who also had a strong friendship with fellow New Mutant Tabitha Smith a.k.a. [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], and a budding relationship with [[Cannonball (comics)|Sam Guthrie]]. A special episode featuring a vacation trip to [[the Bahamas]] focuses on Magma in particular; during this trip, Magma's association with volcanoes is clearly emphasized. She was voiced by [[Alexandra Carter]].
* In the cartoon ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', Amara (voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]) is a young [[White brazilians|white brazilian]] woman and appears in the episode "Thieves Gambit", as a teenage girl whose powers flare out of control. She is chased by the MRD, as part of [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]]'s plan to have a scene of "a mutant putting the public in danger". Wolverine places a power dampening collar created by [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] around her to save her. She later returns it to him as she boards an aircraft sent to pick her up.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' Ep. 5</ref>

===Video games===

* In the video game ''[[X-Men Legends]]'', Magma (portrayed by [[Cree Summer]]) is the main protagonist of the game. She is a new inductee in Xavier's school in the game's storyline and is depicted as an [[United States|American]] girl under the name Alison Crestmere. She was first seen being dragged away by a soldier working for the Genetic Research and Security Organization when Mystique and [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] of the Brotherhood of Mutants arrived to claim her. She was saved by Wolverine and Cyclops and taken to the X-Mansion where she quickly became a student. Later in the game, Professor Xavier offered her (and she accepted) a spot as the newest member of the X-Men team. It was later revealed on [[Asteroid M]] by Mystique that she was their backup plan to power the Gravitron should the Brotherhood fail to rescue [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. While not initially usable in missions, she becomes a prominent member of the team and a vital key to victory.
