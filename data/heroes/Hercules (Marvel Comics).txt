'''Hercules''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the character is based on [[Heracles]] of [[Greek mythology]] and [[Roman mythology]], although the name "[[Hercules]]" is associated with the version from [[Roman mythology]]. The character has starred in three self-titled [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and been a perennial member of the [[superhero]] team the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]''. In 2008, Hercules debuted in his own series titled ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]''. The character was ranked 21st in [[IGN]]'s list of "The Top 50 Avengers",<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/21 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> and has appeared in various forms of media including television series and video games.

==Publication history==
The character was adapted from mythology by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]].

Hercules debuted in ''[[Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' #10 (Nov. 1964) as a minion of Immortus, although his appearance was revealed in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' #1 - 12 (Dec. 1998 – Nov. 1999) as being an impostor. The character's first formal appearance in the Marvel Universe became ''[[Journey into Mystery]] Annual'' #1 (1965), which established Hercules as being a rival of the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

Hercules became a regular guest star in the title ''Thor'', appearing in issue #126 (March 1966). The character guest-starred in ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' #79 (May 1966), and his deadlocked battle with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], as told by Lee, Kirby, and [[Bill Everett]], has come to be regarded as a classic. The tale parallels Hercules and the Hulk's titanic strength, short temper, and simple-mindedness, while contrasting their lot in life: Hercules being a beloved hero and pampered celebrity, while the Hulk is a hated and feared fugitive. The character teamed up with the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' in issue #38 (March 1967), but was not yet an official member; he was merely a guest of the Avengers during his banishment from Olympus. In issue #45 of ''The Avengers'', Hercules became a "full-fledged Avenger" by way of Goliath's announcement to the press during the first annual "Avengers Day".  Hercules also guest starred in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #28 (Dec. 1974) and ''Marvel Premiere'' #26 (Nov. 1975) before starring along with four other heroes in ''[[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]]'' which ran for 17 issues (Oct. 1975 – Jan. 1978).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Karen|title='We'll Keep on Fighting 'Til the End': The Story of the Champions|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65|pages=17–23|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> After this, Hercules made a guest appearance in ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #44 (Oct. 1978).

Hercules starred in two limited series by writer-artist [[Bob Layton]], with both set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]. A 24th century version of Hercules starred in ''Hercules'' #1 - 4 (Sep. – Dec. 1982), which was popular enough to spawn a sequel, ''Hercules'' vol. 2, #1 - 4 (March – June 1984). The storylines dealt with Hercules's [[exile]] from [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]], completion of a series of quests and opportunity to leave his past behind and create a new identity.

Hercules remained a constant guest star in both ''Thor'' and the ''Avengers'', playing a significant role in the "Avengers Under Siege" storyline in ''Avengers'' #270 - 277 (Aug. 1986 – March 1987), involving supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]]. The story lead directly into the "Assault on Olympus" storyline in ''Avengers'' #281 - 285 (July 1987 – Nov. 1987), in which Hercules left the team.

The character starred in the self-titled limited series ''Hercules'' vol. 3, #1 - 5 (June - Sep. 2005), and guest starred in the limited series ''Thor: Blood Oath'' #1 - 6 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006), a retrospective story that depicts the second meeting between the Hercules and Thor.

At the conclusion of the "[[World War Hulk]]" storyline, Hercules received a self-titled publication when Marvel changed the name of the third volume of the ''Incredible Hulk'' series to ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'', effective as of issue #113 (Feb. 2008), and written by [[Greg Pak]] and [[Fred Van Lente]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12939 GREEK WEEK Part I -Pak & Van Lente talk Hercules's Past], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 17, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12985 GREEK WEEK Part IV- Pak & Van Lente on Herc's Past & Future], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 20, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17945 Love, Olympian Style: Pak & Van Lente talk "Incredible Hercules"], [[Comic Book Resources]], September 4, 2008</ref> The series concluded with ''Incredible Hercules'' #141 (April 2010), and was followed by the 2-issue mini-series ''Hercules: Fall of an Avenger'' (March - April 2010). The mini-series is scheduled to lead into the relaunched new title, ''Prince of Power'' #1 (May 2010), also written by Pak and Van Lente.<ref>{{cite web|first= |url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24812 |title=Pak and Van Lente Crown a New "Prince of Power" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=February 11, 2010 |accessdate=February 11, 2010 }}</ref>

The newly super-powered Hercules assembles a second God Squad to battle Mikaboshi, who now calls himself the Chaos King. The combined efforts of the God Squad, [[Alpha Flight]], the Hulk family, and deceased members of the Avengers and X-Men manage to keep the Chaos King's armies at bay, while Cho and Galactus work on a way to transport the entire Earth into the safety of the Continuum universe. Hercules is able to seal off the Chaos King in the Continuum, saving the world. Hercules then expends all his new powers in order to restore the universe, leaving him reduced to a mortal man once again.<ref>''Chaos War'' #1-5</ref>

Hercules reappears in Brooklyn, armed with a new array of Olympian weapons stolen from Ares's armory. They include a magic sword called the Sword of Peleus, the Shield of Perseus (an unbreakable shield that turns anyone who looks at it to stone), arrows that can penetrate through anything, and the Helm of Hades (a helmet of invisibility). He gets a job bar tending at a Greek run bar in Brooklyn.<ref name="Herc #1">''Herc'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Hercules comes across [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]], [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], [[Man-Bull]], and an unidentified fourth character robbing a bank. They had just escaped from the Raft during the breakout caused by Juggernaut, who was transformed into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone. Hercules soon discovers that the amnesiac fourth person with them is actually the witch goddess [[Hecate (Marvel Comics)|Hecate]]. During the fight, Hecate looks into the Shield of Perseus and regains her memories of taking over Brooklyn.<ref>''Herc'' #3</ref> She then teams up with Kyknos in order to take over the city. The pair manage to turn some people against Hercules due to the chaos that the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]'s Worthy created. When Hercules uses the Shield of Perseus to turn some people to stone, Basilisk and Man-Bull flee. The Griffin reacts to the magic forces at work, devolving into a savage beast. He saves Hercules's life and becomes his new steed, allowing him to fly around the city.<ref>''Herc'' #4</ref> Hercules recovers upon hearing the prayers of his worshipers and finds himself in the Griffin's care, only to discover that Brooklyn has been reshaped into a nightmare landscape. Hercules and the Griffin manage to find where Basilisk and Man-Bull are hiding and recruit their help.<ref>''Herc'' #5</ref> The villains approach Hecate and Kyknos using a ruse involving Hercules being turned to stone. Hercules quickly revives and saves the villains by killing Kyknos, then prevents Ares's resurrection by kicking over his alter. Hecate flees and Brooklyn is returned to normal.<ref>''Herc'' #6</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, the Greek owners/operators of the bar where Hercules works have fled the dangers of New York City and returned to Greece, leaving Hercules in charge. He befriends an elderly African man named A. Nancy who loves stories. One night Herc is bitten by a bed bug that gives him spider powers, which he uses to fight crime.<ref>''Herc'' #7</ref> The Queen of Spider Island reveals herself to Herc and makes him her slave. She sends Spider-Herc against the X-Men, who were in town after fighting lizard people in the sewers. They try to reason with him, but he attacks them with the Sword of Peleus. Due to the mutagenic properties of Spider-Man's powers, Spider-Herc mutates into Herc-Spider mid-battle. Shortly after, the X-Men are trapped in a magic web, and the Greek goddess [[Arachne]] appears. Instead of fighting, it is revealed that Arachne is very attracted to Herc's new form and they embrace, while the X-Men are forced to watch. While Arachne is preoccupied, A. Nancy breaks into his home and steals her mythical woven tapestry. He reveals himself as the African spider god [[Anansi]], a collector of stories. Hercules is later cured of his spider transformation by Peter Parker, along with everyone else infected.<ref>''Herc'' #8</ref>

Hercules is called upon to act as a guest instructor at [[Avengers Academy]] when most of the main faculty are preoccupied with the events of ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]''. [[Tigra]] is shocked by his nakedness while demonstrating the ancient Greek art of wrestling and forces him to wear clothing. The school is suddenly visited by Captain America, who asks that the facility be used to hold the younger members of the X-Men until the fighting is over. [[Kavita Rao]] and [[Madison Jeffries]] urge their students to comply with the Avengers, but many are resentful of the confinement. Hercules arranges an Olympic competition between the two schools in order to ease tensions and avoid an actual fight from taking place.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #29</ref> [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] (who was also being held at the Academy) escapes and the faculty members of both schools try to keep him from reaching the students. Hercules is defeated because Shaw is able to absorb the magic energy from his weapons.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #30</ref> Shaw then tells the X-Men students to escape before fleeing himself. Hercules urges Tigra to let the kids join the fight if they want to, believing they had no right to hold them there against their will in the first place. Some of the X-Men students remain at Avengers Academy while many join the fighting, and Hercules reflects that while the older generation has only found war, at least some of the kids were able to find peace.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #31</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Hercules, isolated and shunned by the hero community, attempts to regain his reputation as a true hero, by adapting himself into modern society. During that time, he takes on the threats of the Uprising Storm, a group of new gods consisting of Catastrophobia: God of War, Horrorscope, and Cryptomnesia: God of Data as they plan to wipe out the old gods.<ref>''Hercules'' Vol. 4 #1-6</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Hercules is seen at a bar talking to Amadeus Cho, who has become the new Hulk, when the city is suddenly under attack and both spring into action. During the battle, while Amadeus helps the other heroes, Hercules encounters the Uprising Storm, who tell him of their plan to destroy the world and turn him into one of them by teasing him into believing that the other heroes don't want him anymore. Back home, he confines his encounter to his friends and, after a pep talk from his landlady Sophia, decides to reunite the ancient heroes in order to battle the Uprising Storm. Upon gathering the ancient heroes, known as the Gods of War, Hercules informs them of the situation when the Uprising Storm suddenly show up. They begin to battle, with the Uprising Storm getting the upper hand. In the middle of the fight, Hercules begins to destroy the city when Cryptomnesia uses the brand he placed on him to turn him into a God of Chaos, forcing the others to fight him while the Uprising Storm watch. During the battle, Hercules is confronted by Steve Rogers, [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] who attempt to stop his rampage. After a brief fight, the Gods of War inform the heroes of the Storm and the curse placed on Hercules, though they don't see them. Steve and [[Forgotten One (comics)|Gilgamesh]] then go to free Hercules from the curse which Steve does by yelling "Avengers Assemble". After the brand disappears and the other heroes leave, Hercules informs his friends about the Storm's true intentions, total destruction, and that they must be stopped. Later, while Hercules, Sigurd, Gilgamesh, Beowulf and Theseus ambush the Storm in their hideout, an abandoned hotel, Ire, Lorelei and Tiresias perform a ritual to weaken the Storm. Initially, the ritual has no effect until Horrorscope is defeated and killed by Ire and Lorelei, when she teleported to the apartment to kill them, while Catastrophobia and Cryptomnesia are killed by Gilgamesh and Hercules respectively. After killing Cryptomnesia, Hercules is congratulated by Athena, who offers him a place in Olympus. Hercules turns it down so that he can continue to live on Earth as a true hero.<ref>''Civil War II: Gods of War'' #1-4</ref>

In the aftermath of ''Civil War II'', Hercules rejoins the Avengers, where they foil an ambush by Kang the Conqueror.<ref>''The Avengers'' #1 (2016)</ref> While the others are trapped in limbo as a result of time paradoxes created by Kang, Hercules (immune to Kang's current tactics of targeting the infant Avengers as nobody knows exactly where or when he was born) goes to [[Vietnam]] where he fights two versions of Kang attacking a temple who were looking for an infant version of Kang. After Hercules finds the child, the Avengers return from limbo and start fighting until Vision sends Wasp back in time to return baby Kang to his era.<ref>''The Avengers'' #2 (2016)</ref> After Wasp succeeds, the Avengers make a plan to defeat Kang for good. They assemble the original Avengers from the past and join forces to attack Kang's alternate versions at the same time. After defeating Kang, each of the Avengers return to their timelines.<ref>''The Avengers'' #3-6 (2016)</ref> The Avengers are then recruited by a reformed Doctor Doom operating as Iron Man to defeat a coven of young witches.<ref>''The Avengers'' #7 (2016)</ref> They later battle Avenger X, a member of the original New Avengers, who attempted to eliminate the team until Wasp shrinks her to sub-atomic levels.<ref>''The Avengers'' #8 (2016)</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Hercules appears as a member of the Underground which is a resistance movement against Hydra ever since they took over the United States.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1</ref> Hercules and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] lead a strike force to find the Cosmic Cube fragments so that they can use it to restore Captain America to normal.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #2</ref> Upon convincing [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]] to smuggle them out of the country, the team goes to locate a Cosmic Cube fragment which is in possession of Ultron. Upon arriving, they encounter Hydra's Avengers led by Steve Rogers and are captured by Ultron. They later manage to escape while Ultron gives the team his fragment. During a mission in Madripoor, Hercules got turned to stone by [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]] though he managed to knock him down amongst his petrification.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5</ref> Back at their hideout, Hercules goes to the infirmary to heal until Hydra arrives and attacks the base. The heroes then battle Hydra's Avengers and a revived Bruce Banner as the Hulk until the base explodes.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #6</ref> After their hideout is destroyed, the heroes witness Sam Wilson reassuming the mantle of Captain America. With the use of the Cosmic Cube fragment, they manage to help destroy the Planetary Defense Shield and the [[Darkforce]] dome over Manhattan and liberate all the imprisoned Inhumans. While attacking Hydra forces at the Capitol, the Underground are surprised by Steve Rogers, who was wearing a Cosmic Cube-powered armor. They later witness the final battle between the Hydra Steve Rogers and the real Steve Rogers and the restoration of the US.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #7-10</ref> In the aftermath of the event, Hercules and Vision go to a coffee shop where they discuss about immortality and its ups and downs. They're later signaled by Sam and Thor, who received a call about a supervillain attack, and spring into action.<ref>''The Avengers'' #11 (2016)</ref> Hercules and the other Avengers joined forces with the Champions in order to prevent the High Evolutionary from merging Earth 1 and Earth 2.<ref>''The Avengers'' #672-674 (2016)</ref><ref>''Champions'' #13-15 (2017)</ref>

They battle a group of decommissioned Sentinels while out at a West Hollywood nightclub.<ref>''Iceman'' #6-7 (2017)</ref>

When the [[Human Torch]] starts losing his powers he asks Hercules for advice on how to restore them. Hercules had recently found a way to get his own powers back after losing them fighting the Chaos King. Johnny and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] find him at a bar in Brooklyn drinking non-alcoholic beer. He tells them about how he was healed by a scientist named Rachna Koul.

==Powers and abilities==
Hercules possesses the typical powers of an Olympian god, including superhuman strength, durability, speed, reflexes, stamina and endurance. He is the strongest of the Olympians, being capable of feats such as lifting and hurling a giant sequoia tree, smashing rocks to powder,<ref>''Journey into Mystery Annual'' #1</ref> sealing an entire cliff around an opponent with his bare hands,<ref name="Astonish 1966">''Tales To Astonish'' #79 (May 1966)</ref> knocking out a yellow-crested Titan,<ref name="Thor #129">''Thor'' #129</ref> and dragging the island of [[Manhattan]]<ref name="TeamUp28"/> (though this was later retconned to be merely a boast he had made, and not a genuine feat<ref name="Incredible Hulk #241">''Incredible Hulk'' #241</ref><ref>"Marvel No-Prize Book"</ref>). His superstrong legs allow him to run at speeds of over 100&nbsp;mph, and leap over a hundred feet into the air. He can withstand blows from Thor,<ref>''Thor'' #126</ref> and possesses a complete resistance to high caliber bullets.<ref>''Journey into Mystery''</ref>

Hercules is highly skilled in [[archery]], [[boxing]], [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] and claims to have invented the martial art [[Pankration]].<ref name="ThorBlood" /> In combat he occasionally wields a golden-looking [[adamantium|adamantine]] mace - stated and shown to be equal in durability to Thor's own mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' Annual #1 (1965); ''Avengers'' vol.3, #3 (1996)</ref> (though it is not enchanted with additional abilities as Mjolnir is) - forged by the Greek god [[Hephaestus (Marvel Comics)|Hephaestus]]. As an Olympian, he is resistant to all earthly diseases, possesses a healing factor, immortality, and also has some immunity to magic. However, his strength can be taken by significant Olympian magic, such as that of Zeus.<ref name="Thor #129"/>

Hercules sacrificed his godly powers to save humanity in the wake of the Chaos War, and was completely powerless. Despite this, he retained his exceptional physical condition compared to a normal human, incredible skills in archery and hand-to-hand combat and access to magical weapons and items that help in battle.<ref name="Herc #1"/> At the start of the 2015 ''Hercules'' series, his powers made an unexplained return. They were later revealed to have been restored through scientific means.<ref>''Marvel 2-In-One'' #3</ref> At this time, Hercules made use of both antique and modern weapons, such as assault rifles, tasers, grenade launchers, and others.<ref name="Hercules #1">''Hercules'' #1 (November 2015)</ref>

===24th Century Hercules===
An [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of Hercules stars in a humorous limited series titled ''Hercules'', which depicts the adventures of Hercules in the 24th century. Banished from Olympus by Zeus in order to learn humility, Hercules travels into deep [[space]] where he meets the [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellians]] who loan him [[Recorder (comics)|Recorder]] #417. After adventures on several planets, Hercules arrives in the Omacron star system where he confronts the [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Galactus]] and, after being completely humbled, manages to save the world Galactus intended to devour.<ref>''Hercules'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec. 1982)</ref>

This was followed by a second series with a darker tone. Set forty-one years after the first series, Hercules and Recorder #417 meet and eventually befriend an alien [[Skrull]] called Skyppi (initially using his [[shapeshift]]ing abilities to pose as a gorgeous human female).

Hercules eventually returns to Olympus, and after a battle with Zeus (who has apparently gone [[insane]] and killed the other Olympian gods) proves he has learned humility by sparing Zeus's life.

Having been manipulated all his life by his bitter and vengeful mother, Arimathes is a cruel tyrant and Hercules must do what he can to prevent a war and save his son from his destructive path.<ref>''Hercules, Prince of Power: Full Circle'' (1988)</ref> A three-part storyline in the anthology series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' served as an epilogue to the events of the graphic novel.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #39-41 (December 1989 - January 1990)</ref>

The final adventure of this version of Hercules was presented in a third limited series, ''Hercules: Twilight of a God.'' Set 75 years after the events of the first limited series, this story introduces the three grandchildren of Hercules, a new alien Silver Surfer, and the Galactus Black Hole that threatens all life in the galaxy. The fates of Skyppi, Recorder #417 and Arimathes are revealed as Hercules sacrifices himself to stop the expansion of the galactic threat and, in doing so, alters the destiny of both himself and Galactus.<ref>''Hercules: Twilight of a God'' #1-4 (August - November 2010)</ref>

Several casualties resulted, including the AoA's [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], Horror Show, and Fiend, as well as the X-Treme X-Men's [[Professor X|Xavier]] and Hercules.<ref>''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' #14 (2013)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
