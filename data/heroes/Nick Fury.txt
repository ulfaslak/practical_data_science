[[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] '''Nicholas Joseph Fury''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]] and writer [[Stan Lee]], Fury [[first appeared]] in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' #1 (May 1963), a [[World War II]] [[war comics|combat series]] that portrayed the cigar-chomping Fury as leader of an elite [[U.S. Army]] unit. A popular character over a number of decades, in 2011, Fury was ranked 33rd in [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/33|title= Nick Fury – #33 Top Comic Book Heroes|publisher= IGN|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6Ec64ySqU?url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/33|archivedate= February 22, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= May 29, 2012|df= }}</ref> and 32nd in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers".<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date= April 30, 2012|title= The Top 50 Avengers |url= http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/32|publisher= IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151117074539/http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/32|archivedate= November 17, 2015|deadurl= no |accessdate= July 28, 2015}}</ref> He has sometimes been considered an antihero.

The modern-day Fury, initially a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent, debuted a few months later in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #21 (Dec. 1963). In ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #135 (Aug. 1965), the character was transformed into a spy like [[James Bond]] and leading agent of the fictional espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The character makes frequent appearances in Marvel books as the former head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and as an intermediary between the U.S. government or the [[United Nations]] and various [[superhero]]es. It is eventually revealed that Fury takes a special medication called the Infinity Formula that halted his aging and allows him to be active despite being nearly a century old.

Nick Fury appears in several Marvel series set in [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universes]], as well as multiple animated films, television shows, and video games based on the comics. The character was first portrayed in live action by [[David Hasselhoff]] in the 1998 television movie ''[[Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (film)|Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' [[Samuel L. Jackson]] later signed a nine-picture deal to portray the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] franchise, first appearing in the 2008 film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]].''<ref name="jackson">{{cite web|url= http://www.collider.com/2010/04/19/samuel-l-jackson-talks-iron-man-2-nick-fury-captain-america-thor-and-the-avengers/|first= Sara|last= Wayland|title= Samuel L.

== Publication history ==

=== Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos ===
{{Main|Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos}}
Fury initially appeared in the World War II [[war novel|combat]] series ''Sgt.

The series ran 167 issues (May 1963 – Dec. 1981), though only in reprints after issue #120 (July 1974). Following several issues by creators Lee and Kirby, [[penciller]] [[Dick Ayers]] began his long stint on what would be his signature series; [[John Severin]] later joined as inker, forming a long-running, critically acclaimed team. [[Roy Thomas]] succeeded Lee as writer, followed by [[Gary Friedrich]], for whom this became a signature series as well. Annuals featured the "Howlers" called back to fight in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]].

The Howling Commandos encountered [[Office of Strategic Services]] agent Reed Richards (later [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]) in #3 (Sept. 1963), and fought alongside [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] in #13 (Dec. 1964).

=== ''Strange Tales'' and solo series ===
{{Main|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (comic book)}}
In ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #135 (Aug. 1965), Fury, now a colonel, became a [[James Bond]]-esque [[Cold War]] spy, with Marvel introducing the covert organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] (Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-enforcement Division) and its nemesis [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]].
[[File:strange135.jpg|thumb|''Strange Tales''#135 (Aug. 1965). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Frank Giacoia]].]]
The 12-page feature was initially by Lee and Kirby, with the latter supplying such inventive and enduring gadgets and hardware as the [[Helicarrier]] — an airborne [[aircraft carrier]] — as well as human-replicant LMDs ([[Life Model Decoy]]s), and even [[automobile]] [[airbag]]s.<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 109: "With Jack Kirby providing the artwork and more than a few wild ideas, Fury was made the director of the Supreme Headquarters, International Espionage, Law-Enforcement Division (SHIELD)."</ref> Lee recalled in 2005,
{{quote|[T]here was a very popular television show called ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', sort of a [[James Bond]] type of thing. And I thought, just for fun, I'm going to bring Sgt. Fury back again. But it's now years later and I'm going to make him a colonel, and I'm going to make him the head of an outfit like U.N.C.L.E., a secret military outfit. So I had to think of a name, and I love names, so I came up with the name S.H.I.E.L.D. … [A]nd I think this was Jack's idea, and it was a wonderful idea — they were headquartered in a floating helicarrier,<!--lowercase in source--> which was like a super-[[dirigible]]....<ref>{{cite journal | title = Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|work = [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|volume= 3|issue = 104|page = 21|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = August 2011|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>}}

Writer-penciller-[[colorist]] [[Jim Steranko]] began on the feature in ''Strange Tales'' #151 (Dec. 1966), initially over Kirby layouts.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comics.org/issue/20603/|title= ''Strange Tales'' #151|publisher= Grand Comics Database}}</ref><ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 130: "Writer/artist Jim Steranko had begun to draw the 'Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD' [feature] in ''Strange Tales'' #151 and started writing it four issues later."</ref> He quickly became one of comic books' most acclaimed and influential artists. In some of the creative zeniths of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], Steranko established the feature as one of comic books' most groundbreaking and innovative.<ref>[[Les Daniels]], in ''Comix: A History of Comic Books in America'' (Bonanza Books, New York, 1971; {{LCCN|75-169-104}}, wrote, "[E]ven the dullest of readers could sense that something new was happening. … Which each passing issue Steranko's efforts became more and more innovative. Entire pages would be devoted to [[photocollage]]s of drawings [that] ignored panel boundaries and instead worked together on planes of depth. The first pages … became incredible production numbers similar in design to the [[San Francisco]] [[rock concert]] [[poster]] of the period". [[Larry Hama]] in his introduction to the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] collection ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Who Is Scorpio?'' (Marvel Enterprises, 2001; {{ISBN|0-7851-0766-5}}), said Steranko "combined the figurative dynamism of Jack Kirby with modern design concepts. The [[graphic design|graphic influences]] of [[Peter Max]], Op Art and [[Andy Warhol]] were embedded into the design of the pages—and the pages were designed as a whole, not just as a series of panels. All this, executed in a crisp, hard-edged style, seething with drama and anatomical tension". The series won 1967 and 1968 [[Alley Award]]s, and was inducted in the latter year to the awards' Hall of Fame. Steranko himself was inducted into the [[The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Comic Book Hall of Fame]] in 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher = [[Abrams Books|Harry N.

All the while, he spun plots of intense intrigue, barely hidden sensuality, and hi-fi hipness—and supplied his own version of [[Bond girl]]s, pushing what was allowable under the [[Comics Code]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/21/jim-steranko-comics-jonathan-ross|title= Jonathan Ross meets Jim Steranko, his comic-book hero|first= Jonathan|last= Ross|authorlink= Jonathan Ross|date= July 20, 2010|location= London, United Kingdom|publisher= ''[[The Guardian]]''|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6EcA3OgjX?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jul/21/jim-steranko-comics-jonathan-ross|archivedate= February 22, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= February 21, 2013|quote= His work on his first hit book, ''Nick Fury: Agent of SHIELD'', took the wildly popular Bond secret-agent schtick and gave it a jazzy makeover, with outlandish plots, eye-popping visuals and even 'adult themes' that had the Comics Code Authority demanding several panels in one landmark issue be redrawn.|df= }}</ref>

The 12-page feature ran through ''Strange Tales'' #168 (sharing that "split book" with the occult feature "[[Doctor Strange]]" each issue), after which it was spun off into its own series, titled ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D''. This ran 15 issues (June 1968 – Nov. 1969), followed by three all-reprint issues beginning a year later (Nov. 1970 – March 1971). Steranko wrote and drew issues #1-3 and #5, and drew the covers of #1-7.

Fury continued to make appearances in the other Marvel books, from ''Fantastic Four'' to ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]''. In 1972, ''Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos'' celebrated its 100th issue with a present-day reunion of the squad, sponsored by [[Stan Lee]] and the creative team behind the title. (Lee, like other comic books professionals, has made occasional cameos in his own books, in a tradition going back to the 1940s [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]). The matter of Fury apparently not aging significantly since his term of service in World War II was justified in "Assignment: The Infinity Formula" by writer [[Jim Starlin]] and artist [[Howard Chaykin]] in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #31 (Dec. 1976), revealing Fury's age-retarding medication treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Buttery|first=Jarrod|title=Ready for the Spotlight|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=10 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

A six-issue [[miniseries]], ''[[Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' (June-Nov. 1988) was followed by ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' <!--official title per postal indicia, per GCD--> vol. 2.<ref>DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 242</ref> The latter series lasted 47 issues (Sept. 1989 – May 1993); its pivotal story arc was "the Deltite Affair", in which many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were replaced with Life Model Decoys in a takeover attempt.

A year after that series ended, the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''[[Fury (one-shot)|Fury]]'' (May 1994), using [[retroactive continuity]], altered the events of those previous two series, recasting them as a series of staged events designed to distract Fury from the resurrection plans of HYDRA head [[Baron Strucker|Baron von Strucker]]. The following year, writer Chaykin and penciller Corky Lehmkuhl produced the four-issue miniseries ''[[Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' (April–July 1995). Various publications have additionally focused on Nick Fury's solo adventures, such as the [[graphic novel]]s and one-shots ''[[Wolverine/Nick Fury: The Scorpio Connection]]'' (1989), ''[[Wolverine/Nick Fury: Scorpio Rising]]'' (Oct. 1994), ''[[Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty]]'' and ''[[Captain America and Nick Fury: Blood Truce]]'' (both Feb. 1995), and ''[[Captain America and Nick Fury: The Otherworld War]]'' (Oct. 2001). He starred in the 2004–2005 ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' miniseries.

In the 2018 ''Exiles'' series "the Unseen" will recruit characters to combat an unknown galactic threat.<ref>https://www.newsarama.com/38029-exiles-returns-with-nick-fury-blink-and-iron-lad-for-new-series.html</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==
{{In-universe|date=July 2010}}

=== Early life and wartime ===
Nicholas Joseph Fury is the eldest of three children born to Jack Fury in [[New York City]]. His father is a United States citizen who enlists in the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Flying Corps]] during World War I. Jack enlists in 1916 and is stationed in [[France]]. He shoots down [[Manfred von Richthofen]] early in his flying career, and is a highly decorated combat aviator by the end of the War in 1918.

Discharged after the War, Jack returns home, marries an unnamed woman, and becomes the father of three children. Nick, probably born in the late 1910s or early 1920s, is followed by Jacob "Jake" Fury (later the [[supervillain]] [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]] who co-founded the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] cartel), and their sister, Dawn.

All three children grow up in the neighborhood known as [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan]], New York. Nick is an [[Amateur boxing|amateur boxer]] through the [[Police Athletic League of New York City|New York City Police Athletic League]] where he learns marksmanship. As a teenager in 1937, he went overseas for the first time to fight with the [[International Brigades]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He was on leave in [[Guernica]] when the fascists [[Bombing of Guernica|bombed it]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Paul Cornell|Cornell, Paul]]|penciller= [[Salvador Larroca|Larroca, Salvador]]|inker= Larroca, Salvador|story= Guernica|title= [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]|volume= 6|issue= 12|date= February 2014}}</ref>

After he returns to America, Fury and his friend Red Hargrove leave the neighborhood to pursue their dreams of adventure, eventually settling on a daring [[wing walking]] and parachuting act. Their death-defying stunts while training British [[Commando]]s in 1940 catch the attention of [[Lieutenant]] [[Happy Sam Sawyer|Samuel "Happy Sam" Sawyer]], then serving with the British Commandos, who enlists them for a special mission in the [[Netherlands]]. Nick and Red later join the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], with Fury undergoing Basic Training under a Sergeant Bass. Nick and Red are stationed together at [[Schofield Barracks]], Hawaii when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] ambushes the base on December 7, 1941. Red is among the many killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor, with Fury swearing vengeance against both the Japanese and the Nazis.

Sawyer, now a [[Captain (land)|captain]], assigns Fury command of the First Attack Squad, a unit of [[U.S. Army Ranger]]s, who are awarded the honorary title of Commandos by [[Winston Churchill]] after their first missions. They are nicknamed the "[[Howling Commandos]]" and stationed at a military base in the United Kingdom to fight specialized missions, primarily but not exclusively in the [[European Theatre of World War II]].<!--Howlers fought in Okinawa and elsewhere; Izzy was imprisoned for several issues as a POW in Japan-->
During this period, Fury falls in love with a British nurse, Lady Pamela Hawley, who dies in a bombing raid on London before he can propose to her.

=== C.I.A. ===
At the end of World War II in Europe, Fury is severely injured by a land mine in France, and is found and healed by a Berthold Sternberg, who uses him as a test subject for his Infinity Formula. After making a full recovery, Fury begins working for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Six months into his service, he learns the extent of Sternberg's life-saving operation: the Infinity Formula has stopped his aging, but if he does not receive annual doses, he will age rapidly and die. The doctor begins a 30-year period of extorting large sums of money from Fury in exchange for the injections.<ref name="MS31">{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Starlin|Starlin, Jim]]|penciller= [[Howard Chaykin|Chaykin, Howard]]|inker= Chaykin, Howard|story= Assignment: The Infinity Formula!|title= [[Marvel Spotlight]]|issue= 31|date= December 1976}}</ref>

Fury segues into the CIA as an espionage agent, gathering information in [[Korea]]. During this time the Howling Commandos are reformed where Fury receives a [[battlefield commission]] to lieutenant. He later reaches the rank of [[colonel]]. During this time, he recommends the recruitment of married agents [[Richard and Mary Parker]], who will go on to become the parents of Fury's occasional superhero ally [[Spider-Man]]. Much later, the CIA uses him as a liaison to various superpowered groups that have begun appearing, <!--deleted "in the 1960s" due to Marvel's "elastic chronology" that puts the early-1960s stories as roughly only 10 years before modern-day stories--> including the [[Fantastic Four]], whom CIA agent Fury first encounters in ''Fantastic Four'' #21 (Dec. 1963). Despite Marvel's "elastic chronology", which puts the early-1960s stories as roughly only 10 years before modern-day stories, Marvel has never retconned an explanation for that chronological discrepancy, as the company has for many others.

During his time with the CIA, Fury begins wearing his trademark eyepatch (an issue of ''Sgt. Fury'' had revealed that he had taken shrapnel to one eye during the war, which caused him to slowly lose sight in it over the course of years).

=== S.H.I.E.L.D. ===
Fury becomes the second commander of S.H.I.E.L.D. as its Public Director. The ultimate authority of S.H.I.E.L.D. is revealed to be a cabal of 12 mysterious men and women who give Fury his orders and operational structure, leaving Fury to manage the actual implementation of these orders and strategems.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Bob Harras|Harras, Bob]]|penciller= [[Paul Neary|Neary, Paul]]|inker= DeMulder, Kim|story= The Delta Equation (Nick Fury Vs S.H.I.E.L.D. Book One)|title= Nick Fury Vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.|issue= 1|date= June 1988}}</ref> The identities of these people have never been revealed; they appear only as shaded figures on monitors. Initially, his organization's primary nemesis is the international terrorist organization Hydra, created by Fury's worst enemy of World War II, Baron [[Wolfgang von Strucker]] (after [[retcon]]ning of the original continuity). Under Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D. grows into one of the world's most powerful organizations, reaching covertly into national governments and forming strategic alliances with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and other [[superhero]] groups, while always maintaining independence and deniability. Fury soon becomes the superhero community's main contact when government-related information is required in order to deal with a crisis.

After years at the helm, Fury discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra have both fallen under the control of a group of sentient [[Life Model Decoy]] androids known as Deltites. Betrayed, Fury goes to ground, hunted by his fellow agents, many of whom are later revealed to have been replaced with Deltites. Although Fury ultimately exposes and overcomes the Deltite threat, the conflict is so destructive to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s personnel and infrastructure, and leaves Fury so disillusioned, that he disbands the agency to prevent it from again being subverted from within.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Harras, Bob|penciller= Neary, Paul|inker= DeMulder, Kim|story= Light of Truth (Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. Book Six)|title= Nick Fury Vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.|issue= 6|date= November 1988}}</ref>

Fury rebuilds S.H.I.E.L.D. from the ground up, initially as a more streamlined agency small enough for him to personally oversee and protect from being corrupted. This new incarnation changed the acronym to stand for "Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage and Logistics Directorate".<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Harras, Bob|penciller= [[Bob Hall (comics)|Hall, Bob]]|inker= DeMulder, Kim|story= The Past Still Haunts|title= Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.|volume= 3|issue= 1|date= September 1989}}</ref>

Sometime later, Frank Castle, the [[vigilante]] known as the [[Punisher]], is captured and sent to a maximum-security facility with a S.H.I.E.L.D. escort. During a hypnosis session with [[Doc Samson]], a character named Spook interrupts and has the Punisher conditioned to believe Fury is responsible for the murder of the Punisher's family.

Returned to his post as S.H.I.E.L.D. director, Fury independently enlists the [[superhero]]es [[Captain America]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] to launch a covert assault on the leadership of [[Latveria]], which is plotting a massive attack on the U.S. One year afterward, Latveria launches a counterattack that results in Fury's removal as S.H.I.E.L.D. commander, forcing him again into hiding with numerous international warrants out for his arrest. His successors as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. are first [[Maria Hill]] and then [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Bendis|first = Brian Michael|authorlink = Brian Michael Bendis|author2=Dell'Otto, Gabriele |authorlink2=Gabriele Dell'Otto |title = [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2009|pages = 256|isbn = 978-0-7851-4228-7}}</ref> Both Hill and Stark, keeping Fury's disappearance secret from the S.H.I.E.L.D. rank and file, use Life Model Decoys to impersonate Fury on occasion.

Fury is the only "33rd-degree" S.H.I.E.L.D. officer, meaning he is the only member of S.H.I.E.L.D., present or past, to know of the existence of 28 emergency, covert bases scattered across the globe, secretly providing the Anti-Registration faction in the subsequent superhuman [[Civil War (comics)|civil war]] with bases where they can rally their forces without worrying about their Pro-Registration enemies finding them.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Millar|Millar, Mark]]|penciller= [[Steve McNiven|McNiven, Steve]]|inker= [[Dexter Vines|Vines, Dexter]]|title= [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]|issue= 2|date= August 2006}}</ref>

=== Secret Invasion ===
During the time Fury spends in hiding, he learns that [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]] has been plotting to extract S.H.I.E.L.D. passcodes from him and kill him.

Nick Fury accepted, and explains that over the decades, outside of spying on hippies and socialists, and "destabilizing"/causing wars across countries on Earth in his regular work with the Army, and later, S.H.I.E.L.D., he defended the Earth against threats through virtually any means whatsoever, including systematic torture against aliens, genocide against planetary civilizations, and warmongering spanning entire galaxies.

Later while he still cannot interfere with the events he is observing, he is able to summon Blink to him and tells her of things going on in the greater multiverse, terrible creatures that are destroying time, space and dimension, and tells her that she is chosen by the device to act as protector of the very fabric of the Multiverse.<ref>''Exiles'' #1</ref> However, due to this interference in the timestream, a faction of Watchers assaulted him with the objective of ending his involvement, even if it means the end of the Multiverse.<ref>''Exiles'' #3</ref>

He has also continued Uatu's tradition of observing parallel universes, including observing a reality where [[Flash Thompson]] became Spider-Man only to turn himself in after accidentally killing Peter Parker.<ref>''What If: Spider-Man'' vol.2 #1</ref> It is also revealed that the Maker is aware of the Unseen's existence.<ref>''Venom'' (2018) #8</ref>

== Powers, abilities, and equipment ==
According to the comic books, Nick Fury's aging has been slowed greatly by the Infinity Formula, a serum created by Dr. Berthold Sternberg. Fury was first inoculated with the serum in the 1940s. Fury took the serum annually for many years. Originally Fury had to take the formula annually or the effects would be reversed, allowing his body to reach its actual chronological age.<ref name="MS31" /> Nick Fury is depicted as an active athletic man despite his advanced chronological age, though writers have sometimes portrayed Fury as being past his prime despite the Infinity Formula as in the ''Fury and Wolverine'' graphic novel. As of the "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]" story arc, it is revealed that at some point the Infinity Formula stopped working for him and Fury has only pretended to stop aging by using [[Life Model Decoy|LMDs]].<ref name="OS6" />

Fury's injured left eye, though initially minimally affected by a grenade blast during World War II,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]]|inker= [[John Tartaglione|Tartaglione, John]]|story= Fury Fights Alone|title= [[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]|issue= 27|date= February 1966}}</ref> has over the decades resulted in a 95% loss of vision in this eye. Despite some comments to the contrary, Fury has not had the eye removed, nor bionically enhanced, and he merely covers it with a cosmetic eye-patch to prevent depth perception distortion. He has explained that when needing to disguise himself, he only needs to remove the eyepatch, slip in a contact lens and darken his hair, as everyone always looks for a one-eyed man.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Goodwin, Archie]]|penciller= Chaykin, Howard|inker= Chaykin, Howard|title= Wolverine, Nick Fury: The Scorpio Connection|issue= 1|date= 1989}}</ref>

Fury is a seasoned unarmed and armed combat expert, was a heavyweight [[Boxing|boxer]] in the army (during [[World War II]]), and holds a black belt in [[Tae Kwon Do]] and a brown belt in [[Jujutsu|Jiu Jitsu]]. He has further honed his unarmed combat skills sparring with [[Captain America]]. The character is a combat veteran of three wars, [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]], as well as numerous "military adviser" missions and clandestine operations ("a dozen conflicts you've never even heard of"). He is trained as a [[paratrooper]], [[United States Army Ranger|Ranger]], a [[demolition]]s expert, vehicle specialist (including aircraft and seagoing vessels), and a [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Fury has access to a wide variety of equipment and weaponry designed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] technicians. He wears a S.H.I.E.L.D. uniform made of 9-ply [[Kevlar]] (able to withstand ballistic impact up to .45 caliber bullets) and a [[Beta cloth]] (type C), a fire-resistant material, which has a kindling temperature of {{convert|1700|°F|°C}}. Fury uses various types of handguns, including a .15 caliber needle gun, a [[M1911|government issue .45 caliber automatic]], a captured German [[Luger pistol|Luger]] in [[9×19mm Parabellum|9mm Parabellum]], a modified semi-automatic [[Walther PPK]] in 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum, and the Ingram [[MAC-10]] machine pistol in [[.45 ACP]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

As the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury has access to the entire S.H.I.E.L.D. highly advanced arsenal of weaponry; various air, land, and sea craft provided by S.H.I.E.L.D.; and numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. paraphernalia, including a radio-link tie and a bulletproof suit. Due to his high-ranking status, even when S.H.I.E.L.D. is directed by Tony Stark, and then Norman Osborn, Fury retains access to several S.H.I.E.L.D. warehouses and paraphernalia that are unknown to anyone else but him.

After his transformation into '''The Unseen''', Nick Fury now possesses the same Cosmic Awareness as the Watchers, which grants him the ability to observe different timelines, allowing him to see the past, present and even possible futures of every alternate timelines.<ref>''Exiles (Vol. 3)'' #2</ref>
