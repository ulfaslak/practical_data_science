'''Star-Lord''' ('''Peter Jason Quill''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Steve Gan]], first appeared in ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #4 (January 1976). The son of human Meredith Quill and Spartoi [[J'son (comics)|J'son]], Peter Quill assumes the mantle of Star-Lord, an interplanetary policeman.

The character played prominent roles in the comic book storylines "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" (2006) and "[[Annihilation: Conquest]]" (2007), "[[War of Kings]]" (2008), and ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' (2009). He became the leader of the [[outer space|space]]-based superhero team [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in the 2008 relaunch of the comic of the same name. He has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise, including [[Animated series#Television|animated television series]], [[toy]]s and [[trading card]]s. [[Chris Pratt]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] beginning with the 2014 live action film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''. He will also reprise the role in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''. [[Wyatt Oleff]] portrays a young Peter Quill in the first two ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' films.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in the black-and-white magazine publication ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #4 (Jan 1976). Creator [[Steve Englehart]] had plans for the character that went unrealized. He later reflected on his website:

{{quote|I conceived something very large. My hero would go from being an unpleasant, introverted jerk to the most cosmic being in the universe, and I would tie it into my then-new interest in [[astrology]]. After his earthbound beginning, his mind would be opened step by step, with a fast-action story on Mercury, a love story on Venus, a war story on Mars, and so on out to the edge of the solar system, and then beyond.

But{{emdash}}after his earthbound beginning, where I established him as an unpleasant, introverted jerk, I left Marvel, so no one ever saw what he was to become.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Star-Lord.html|title= Star-Lord|first= Steve|last= Englehart|authorlink= Steve Englehart|date= n.d.|publisher= SteveEnglehart.com|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6S3yl1d9A?url=http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Star-Lord.html|archivedate= August 24, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate= December 26, 2010|df= }}</ref>}}

Star-Lord continued to appear in ''Marvel Preview'', with writer [[Chris Claremont]] revamping the character and using science fiction adventure stories like the [[Heinlein juveniles]] for inspiration.<ref name="MP11">{{cite comic| writer= [[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]|penciller= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|inker= [[Terry Austin (comics)|Austin, Terry]]|story= Star-Lord|title= [[Marvel Preview]]|issue= 11|date= Summer 1977}}</ref> Heinlein's lawyers threatened legal action over the cover to ''Marvel Preview'' #11, which featured a blurb that described the content as "a novel-length science fiction spectacular in the tradition of Robert A.

The character returned in ''[[Thanos]]'' #8–12 (May–Sept. 2004) and ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' #1-6 (2006). The following year, he received a four issue eponymous title (''Annihilation: Conquest{{spaced ndash}}Star-Lord'') leading into the "[[Annihilation: Conquest]]" crossover storyline, in which he played a central role. Spinning out of "Annihilation: Conquest", a second volume of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' featured a team of characters from the crossover who were led by Star-Lord for the duration of the title's 25-issue run. Plot lines from that series were concluded in ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' mini-series.

Because of revisions to the character's origin, his early appearances have been officially designated as occurring in an alternate reality.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.marvunapp.com/master/earthteaz.htm#numbered|title= Numbered Realities|first= Jeff|last= Jeff Christiansen|date= n.d.|publisher= Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160921061903/http://www.marvunapp.com/master/earthteaz.htm|archivedate= September 21, 2016|deadurl= no|quote= Earth-791 Star-Lord (Peter Quill) sired by Jason of Sparta, given Star-Lord identity and weaponry by Master of the Sun.

==Fictional character biography==
When [[J'son (comics)|J'son]]'s ship crash lands on Earth, he is taken in by Meredith Quill. The two form a relationship while J'son makes repairs to his ship. Eventually, J'son is forced to leave to return home and fight in a war. He leaves, not knowing Meredith is pregnant with Peter Quill. Ten years later, Meredith is killed when she is attacked by two [[Badoon]] soldiers who have come to kill Peter and end J'son's blood line. Peter finds his father's gun by accident, kills them with a shotgun, and escapes his home before it is destroyed by the Badoon ship. The Badoon presume Peter has been killed and leave. Peter is placed in an orphanage and eventually joins [[NASA]].<ref name="GotGPointOne"/> It was eventually explained that he was raised by his mother's best friend [[Lisa Chang]] who was a commander at NASA.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Humphries, Sam|penciller= Garron, Javier|inker= Garron, Javier|story= Year One, Chapter One: Free Falling|title= Star-Lord|issue= 1|date= January 2016}}</ref>

Later, when his ship malfunctions and he is stranded in space, Peter is found by the Ravagers, a group of space pirates led by [[Yondu#Earth 616|Yondu]]. After the Ravagers saved Peter, he tried to steal their ship. Peter managed to outsmart every member of the Ravagers and even knocked out Yondu before capturing him. After he woke up, Yondu managed to set himself free from his restraints and attacked Peter and gave him a choice between letting himself be released to space without more trouble or get killed right there. Peter instead asked him if he could join his crew. Yondu was not sold on the idea but after he found out Peter was like him as they were both "kids without homes", Yondu changed his mind and let him stay in the ship with the Ravagers as their cleaning boy. Peter decided to stay and try to learn everything he could from space while he was part of the Ravagers.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Humphries, Sam|penciller= Garron, Javier|inker= Garron, Javier|story= Year One, Chapter Two: Space Pirates Of The Galaxy|title= Star-Lord|issue= 2|date= February 2016}}</ref>

Peter decides to remain inactive for a time until he found out his father was planning to pass a law that forbade any interaction of extraterrestrial or space origin with Earth. Knowing this would be an open invitation for invasion, Peter decides to reform the Guardians with six members: [[Gamora]], [[Rocket Raccoon|Rocket]], [[Groot]], [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]], and [[Bug (comics)|Bug]], along with himself, and start protecting Earth from any attack.

===The Black Vortex===
Peter and Kitty were successful in stealing the artifact called [[The Black Vortex]], but found themselves outnumbered by J'son's killing squad so they decided to call the X-Men and the remaining Guardians for help. Knowing the artifact could give them the needed power to defeat J'son, Peter wanted everyone to submit to the Vortex to gain cosmic powers. Kitty stood against the idea but some of their friends submitted anyway. After failing to stop them, the submitted cosmic warriors attacked Hala and Peter went with a team to help the Kree in the battle. After some failed negotiations for the Vortex his team had to escape, but J'son found them and destroyed Hala in retaliation. Peter escaped on time. After finding Spartax had been completely covered in amber by Thane, including Kitty, Peter lamented not having heard her since the beginning and apologize to her. Kitty escaped thanks to her phasing powers and both had a reunion. Seeing no other way to defeat J'son and his cosmic empowered team, Peter tried to submit to the Vortex but after seeing the power would eventually make him push Kitty away, he refused. Kitty ended up submitting and saving Spartax. After the war ended, Peter had a romantic talk with Kitty where he proposes to Kitty Pryde, a proposal which she accepts.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Sam Humphries|Humphries, Sam]]|penciller= [[Javier Garrón|Garrón, Javier]]; [[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]]|inker= [[Mark Farmer|Farmer, Mark]]; Garrón, Javier; McGuinness, Ed|story= The Black Vortex Chapter 13|title= Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: The Black Vortex Omega|issue= 1|date= June 2015}}</ref>

===Secret Wars===
When the universe is facing its imminent end, Star-Lord and the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy come to the world's final battle against the Children of Tomorrow. During the battle, Groot and Rocket Raccoon are killed, and Star-Lord is teleported away by [[Reed Richards]] to his ship. In the end, he is one of the few survivors of the apocalypse aboard the [[Fantastic Four]]'s "life raft".<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Jonathan Hickman|Hickman, Jonathan]]|penciller= [[Esad Ribić|Ribić, Esad]]|inker= Ribić, Esad|story= The End Times|title= [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]|issue= 1|date= July 2015}}</ref> After the end of the universe, [[Doctor Doom]] somehow creates a new, patchwork world formed from the remains of dead universes.

Star-Lord ends up in the domain of [[Manhattan]], where he gets a job singing in the popular club, "the Quiet Room", singing [[Disney]] songs, as Disney films never existed in [[Battleworld]], using the alias of Steve Rogers to hide from Doom. It is here that he runs into an alternate universe version of Kitty Pryde (from the [[Age of Apocalypse]] universe), who is hunting down artifacts from before Battleworld's creation. Hoping to talk to who he believes is his fiancé, he accidentally messes up a deal between Kitty and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] to obtain an ancient artifact. Gambit leaves, but Kitty uses a scanner to discover that Star-Lord is from before Battleworld's creation, and plans on taking him to Doom. However, they are ambushed by a group of robots connected to Gambit. The two decide to steal an artifact that Gambit has, but it was a trap and the two are captured. Right before Gambit can kill them, a version of Drax appears, who originally hired Peter to work in the Quiet Room, and knocks out Gambit. The three escape with the artifact secured. When they are safe the next morning, Kitty shows it to the two, only to find out its Rocket Racoon's tail. Star-Lord laments the death of his friend, and Kitty decides to allow him to keep it, as it is the one thing left of his old universe. Star-Lord thanks Kitty, who kisses him before heading back to her home of Doomguard. Realizing the two are out of a job for abandoning the Quiet Room in the middle of a show, Star-Lord and Drax decide to go back into Star-Lord's old career as a thief. He asks Drax if he knows a good geneticist, as he plans on using Rocket's tail to make a clone of his friend, possibly an army of them.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Humphries, Sam|penciller= [[Alti Firmansyah|Firmansyah, Alti]]|inker= Firmansyah, Alti|title= Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde|issue= 1|date= September 2015}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Humphries, Sam|penciller= Firmansyah, Alti|inker= Firmansyah, Alti|title= Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde|issue= 2|date= October 2015}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Humphries, Sam|penciller= Firmansyah, Alti|inker= Firmansyah, Alti|title= Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde|issue= 3|date= November 2015}}</ref>

During the final stand against God Doom, Peter not only piloted a ship to take the two Reed Richards' to the heart of [[Castle Doom]], but also managed to keep [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]] occupied by using the last twig of Groot, kept in his pocket ever since the Incursions to be planted at the crucial moment.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Hickman, Jonathan|penciller= Ribić, Esad|inker= Ribić, Esad|story= Under Siege|title= Secret Wars|issue= 8|date= February 2016}}</ref>

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Following the restoration of reality, Peter ascended to the throne of Spartax, with Rocket taking over leadership of the Guardians while Kitty- now under the alias of Star-Lady- and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]- following the disbanding of the FF while the Richards' family worked to restore the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]- joined the team.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Schiti, Valerio|inker= Schiti, Valerio|title= Guardians of the Galaxy|volume= 4|issue= 1|date= December 2015}}</ref> After Kree accuser Hala and the ruthless Yotat the Destroyer caused mass destruction on Spartax while trying to eliminate Quill, he was forced to return to the Guardians due to the accusations of his delegates about his responsibility for the resulting deaths.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Schiti, Valerio|inker= Schiti, Valerio|title= Guardians of the Galaxy|volume= 4|issue= 5|date= April 2016}}</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Star-Lord and the Guardians of the Galaxy assist Captain Marvel in the fight against [[Iron Man]] as her surprise weapon. During the battle, the Guardians ship explodes, leaving them stranded on Earth. After Iron Man's faction leaves, Gamora overhears a conversation between Peter and Kitty in which she finds out that Peter knew that Thanos was on Earth the entire time they were there without telling the rest of the team. After stopping Gamora from storming into the Triskelion and killing Thanos, Gamora and the other Guardians leave Peter for not telling them the truth. Peter and Kitty then break off their engagement.

====Grounded====
Living alone in an apartment given to him by [[Abigail Brand]], Peter calls [[Howard the Duck]] to try and have drinks with him, and Howard furiously hangs up. He then finds Kitty and [[Old Man Logan]] in an art gallery, where Kitty shouts at him for carrying his guns into an art gallery with children. Frustrated, Peter leaves. Logan then catches up to him and has drinks with him in a bar, where they fight hitmen, which attracts the attention of the police. Logan flees the scene and Peter is captured.

Peter is prosecuted by [[Matt Murdock]], who argues that unlike other superheroes, Star-Lord was reckless and endangered civilians while causing substantial property damage. The trial is interrupted by Brand, who gets the judge to reduce Peter's sentence to community service, to which Peter agrees. Brand and Alpha Flight then give him a new skin-tight costume, and he is assigned to senior citizen Edmund Allen, a retired super criminal named Silver Bandit. After a day of bonding, Star-Lord is hired as a bartender at a bar for supervillains owned by Edmund's son.

==Powers and abilities==
Star-Lord is a master strategist and problem solver who is an expert in close-quarter combat, various human and alien firearms, and battle techniques. He has extensive knowledge of various alien customs, societies, and cultures, and considerable knowledge about cosmic abstracts, such as [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]].

As Star-Lord, Peter Quill wears a suit that grants augmented strength and durability and the ability to travel through space. The character uses an "Element Gun", a special meta-pistol capable of projecting one of the [[Classical element|four elements]] (air, earth, fire and water). Star-Lord shares a [[psychic]] link with his [[sentient]] space vessel, "Ship".

"Ship" is actually a sentient energy form. She most often exists in the form of a starship, but can alter her structure at will. She can travel through air, space and water. She possesses many of the conventional starship accessories, including shields, energy blasters, advanced [[sensors]], replicators (able to form any kind of food, drink, etc.), and [[hologram projectors]]. She has proven capable of creating a human form, which she can then animate and use as a host. Even if completely destroyed, she is capable of restoring herself, since her true form is her consciousness. In addition, she takes on a number of feminine characteristics, such as a mothering instinct for those she is partnered with. She has felt deeper attachments, including love for her partners.

"Ship" can create Widgets—small, mobile droids able to scout out situations, gather information, and then return to her. The full extent of "Ship's" abilities are unknown.

During Star-Lord's battle with The Fallen One, his Element Gun, suit and "Ship" were destroyed. Due to severe injury he was grafted with cybernetic implants by doctors on the Kyln, where he was sentenced. The eye implant allows him to see all energy spectra and the memory chip in his brain gives him 100% total recall.

On the Kree world of Aladon Prime, Star-Lord's cybernetic implants were removed. Star-Lord was outfitted with a Kree-issued heat-dampening espionage battle-suit, which became the hallmark look for the Guardians of the Galaxy, a battle helmet, and a universal translator, all of which he still uses. His battle helmet can analyze strategy data, improve vision, and regulate oxygen in space.

Star-Lord's chosen weapons are two Kree sub-machine guns with various types of ammunition, including explosives.

After escaping the Cancerverse, Peter acquires a new element gun(s), but discards his armor.

==Other characters named Star-Lord==
A three-issue limited series, titled ''Starlord'', featured a man named Sinjin Quarrel adopting the identity 12 years after the disappearance of the original Star-Lord (Peter Jason Quill).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/starlor2.htm|title= Starlord (Sinjin Quarrel)|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= September 18, 2002|publisher= Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130308195843/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/starlor2.htm|archivedate= March 8, 2013|deadurl= no}}</ref> The series, published from December 1996 to February 1997, was written by [[Timothy Zahn]], with art by Dan Lawlis.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 13430|title= Starlord}}</ref> Whether the events depicted in this miniseries fit into Peter Quill's chronology has never been revealed.

==Other versions==

===Classic===
Star-Lord's adventures in ''Marvel Preview'' #4 and #11 have been officially designated as occurring in an alternate past. In these issues, Peter Quill is born during an unusual astronomical phenomenon when many of the planets align. Seeing no resemblance, the man who believed he was Quill's father accuses his wife Meredith of infidelity and attempts to kill the infant, but dies of a sudden heart attack. Peter is raised by his single mother until she is killed by Ariguans when he is eleven.<ref name="MP4" /> Quill is placed in an orphanage but escapes and eventually becomes a trainee NASA astronaut. An alien entity called the Master of the Sun later visits the space station that Quill and other astronauts are inhabiting, and offers the mantle of Star-Lord (an interplanetary policeman) to a worthy candidate. Quill volunteers, but is rejected in favor of a colleague he once treated badly. Quill is outraged, and NASA orders his return to Earth and discharge for his conduct. Instead, he steals a scout ship, returns to the space station, and takes his colleague's place. Quill becomes Star-Lord, with the Master of the Sun first creating an illusion in which the character is able to find and kill the aliens that murdered his mother to free him of his past. Equipped with a sentient vessel called "Ship", Quill commences his role as Star-Lord.<ref name="MP4" /><ref name="AHMU">{{cite web|url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/starlor1.htm|title= Star-Lord (Peter Quill)|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= March 7, 2014|publisher= Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6S409BOlX?url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/starlor1.htm|archivedate= August 24, 2014|deadurl= no|df= }}</ref>

Star-Lord then meets Emperor Jason who reveals that he is Peter's father. Jason explains that he had crashed on Earth decades earlier and been rescued by Meredith Quill. During the year that he had spent repairing his ship, Jason and Meredith fell in love. When it came time to leave, Jason, for Meredith's safety, had placed a mindlock on her memories of him, causing her to remember their year together as only a dream.<ref name="MP11" /><ref name="AHMU" />

* [[Chris Pratt]] portrays Peter Quill / Star-Lord in the films set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].
** The character first appears in the 2014 film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.<ref name="Pratt" /> In 1988, when Peter Quill was a young boy in [[Missouri]] and unable to accept his mother's death due to cancer, he leaves the hospital in tears, and is subsequently abducted by an extraterrestrial star-ship. Twenty-six years later, he is a member of the Ravagers, the mercenary gang who abducted him as a child led by [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]], and has had many adventures with this crew around the galaxy. While on a scavenging job, Peter finds himself embroiled in a significant power struggle and revenge war between two advanced galactic powers, the [[Kree]] warlord [[Ronan the Accuser]] and [[Xandar]]'s [[Nova Corps]] while also being hunted by Yondu after failing to bring him a stolen relic later revealed to be an Infinity Stone which Ronan seeks. Throughout the movie, Peter is shown listening to a [[mixtape]] of various hit songs from 1962 – 1986 in a [[Sony Walkman|Walkman]] that was given to him by his mother, which serves as his only connection with Earth. One recurring gag in the film is everyone's failure to remember Quill's alias.
** Star-Lord returns in the 2017 sequel ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''.<ref name="Vol2Film">{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-footage-recap/|title=''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' Footage Recap: Baby Groot, Human Ego & So Much More [Comic-Con 2016]|last=Han|first=Angie|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=July 23, 2016|accessdate=July 24, 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6jEZEZhFA?url=http://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-footage-recap/|archivedate=July 24, 2016|deadurl=no|df=}}</ref> In this film, Quill learns that his father is [[Ego the Living Planet]], a primordial Celestial who manifests a human avatar that allows him to interact with other races, with Ego informing Quill that he too possesses his Celestial abilities. Peter is initially happy to have found his father and to have family again, however, it is eventually revealed that Ego intends to terraform all other planets into extensions of himself, killing all other life, and had conceived Peter with the intention that his son would provide the extra power necessary to do so. He turns against his father when it is revealed that Ego killed his mother to ensure his focus on his self-perceived 'duty'. Peter keeps Ego occupied in combat with his newfound Celestial powers until the other Guardians are able to destroy Ego's brain. After Ego dies and Peter loses his Celestial powers, he is rescued from the planet's destruction by Yondu, who sacrifices his life in the process. The Guardians hold a memorial to give Yondu an honorable funeral, during which Peter realizes that Yondu is the man who has truly been a father to him, and the Ravagers arrive to pay homage. Peter also replaces his Walkman, which Ego had destroyed, with a [[Zune]].
** Star-Lord appears in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''. During the film, Peter, along with the rest of the Guardians, rescue [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] from the wreckage of the Asgardian refugee vessel, and learns of Thanos's quest for the Infinity Stones. He leads Gamora, Drax, and Mantis to Knowhere, where Thor tells them Thanos will be seeking the Reality Stone. Gamora privately asks Peter to kill her if Thanos should capture her to prevent him from learning the location of the Soul Stone, to which he reluctantly agrees; the two then share a kiss. On Knowhere, Peter gives Gamora instructions when the group confronts Thanos, which she ignores; she is then captured by Thanos as she had feared. After they share their love for one another, Peter tearfully keeps his promise, but is rendered innefective by Thanos with the Reality Stone. After Thanos leaves with Gamora, Peter, Drax, and Mantis go to Titan and meet [[Iron Man]], [[Doctor Strange]], and [[Spider-Man]], and eventually fight Thanos when he arrives on the planet. The heroes briefly gain the upper hand, with Mantis subduing him with her powers, but when Peter learns that Thanos has killed Gamora, he loses his temper and attacks Thanos, inadvertently breaking Mantis' hold. After Thanos completes the Infinity Gauntlet and eliminates half of all life in the universe, Star-Lord is among those who cease to exist.
