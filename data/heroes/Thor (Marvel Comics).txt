The [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] Thor debuted in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #83 ([[cover-date]] August 1962), and was created by editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and penciller-plotter [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 88|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= [Stan Lee] had always been fascinated by the legends of the Norse gods and realized that he could use those tales as the basis for his new series centered on the mighty Thor...The heroic and glamorous style that...Jack Kirby [had] was perfect for Thor.}}</ref> A different version of the mythological Thor had appeared previously in ''[[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]]'' #12–13 (February–April 1951).<ref>[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] "1940s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 39: "Not only did Olympian gods appear, but so did the Norse gods Thor and Loki."</ref>  Lee in 2002 described Thor's genesis early in the Marvel pantheon, following the creation of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]:

[[File:Unexpected Thor.JPG|thumb|left|Thor, as depicted by [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (comics)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' #16 (1957).]]

In a 1984 interview Kirby said "I did a version of Thor for D.C. in the fifties before I did him for Marvel. I created Thor at Marvel because I was forever enamored of legends, which is why I knew about Balder, Heimdall, and Odin.

Subsequent stories of the 13-page feature "The Mighty Thor" continued to be plotted by Lee, and were variously scripted by Lieber or by [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]], working under the pseudonym "R. Berns". Various artists penciled the feature, including Jack Kirby, [[Joe Sinnott]], [[Don Heck]], and [[Al Hartley]]. With ''Journey into Mystery'' #101 (Feb. 1964), the series began a long and definitive run by writer and co-plotter Lee and penciler and co-plotter Kirby that lasted until the by-then-retitled ''Thor'' #179 (Aug. 1970).<ref name=uhmcc>{{cite web |url= http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/thor.htm#S145|title= ''Thor'' (I) • ''The Mighty Thor'' (I) (1966–1996)|publisher = Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators | quote= Series is named "Thor" in the imprint, but most covers have the title "The Mighty Thor".}}</ref><ref>{{gcdb series|id= 1749|title= Thor}}</ref>

Lee and Kirby included Thor in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #1 (Sept. 1963) as a founding member of the superhero team.<ref name="DeFalco94">DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 94: "Filled with some wonderful visual action, ''The Avengers'' #1 has a very simple story: the Norse god Loki tricked the Hulk into going on a rampage. In response, Rick Jones and his Teen Brigade tried to contact the Fantastic Four for help. However, Loki redirected the radio signal so Thor would hear it in the expectation that he would battle [the Hulk]."</ref> The character has since appeared in every subsequent volume of the series.

The five-page featurette "Tales of Asgard" was added in ''Journey into Mystery'' #97 (Oct. 1963),<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 95: "These backup stories originally began with updated versions of Norse mythology, but later switched to the adventures of a younger Thor."</ref> followed by "The Mighty Thor"<!--not yet official title of comic, so not ital--> becoming the dominant cover logo with issue #104 (May 1964). The feature itself expanded to 18 pages in #105, which eliminated the remaining anthological story from each issue; it was reduced to 16 pages five issues later. Comics historian [[Les Daniels]] noted that "the adventures of Thor were gradually transformed from stories about a strange-looking superhero into a spectacular saga."<ref>{{cite book|last= Daniels|first= Les|authorlink= Les Daniels|title= Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher= [[Abrams Books|Harry N.

''Journey into Mystery'' was retitled ''Thor'' (per the [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]], or ''The Mighty Thor'' per most covers)<ref name=uhmcc /> with issue #126 (March 1966). "Tales of Asgard" was replaced by a five-page featurette starring the [[Inhumans]] from #146–152 (Nov. 1967 – May 1968), after which featurettes were dropped and the Thor stories expanded to Marvel's then-standard 20-page length. Marvel filed for a [[trademark]] for "The Mighty Thor" in 1967 and the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] issued the registration in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://trademark.markify.com/trademarks/uspto/the+mighty+thor/72278018|title= The Mighty Thor|publisher= Markify|accessdate= May 23, 2013}}</ref>

After Kirby left the title, [[Neal Adams]] penciled issues #180–181 (Sept.-Oct. 1970).<ref>{{cite journal|last = Schumer|first = Arlen|title = Neal Adams: The Marvel Years|journal = [[Comic Book Artist]]|issue = 3|pages = |publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = Winter 1999|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|url = http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/03adams.html|accessdate = May 12, 2013}}</ref> [[John Buscema]] then became the regular artist the following issue. Buscema continued to draw the book almost without interruption until #278 (Dec. 1978). Lee stopped scripting soon after Kirby left, and during Buscema's long stint on the book, the stories were mostly written by [[Gerry Conway]], [[Len Wein]], or [[Roy Thomas]]. Thomas continued to write the title after Buscema's departure, working much of the time with the artist [[Keith Pollard]]; during this period Thomas integrated many elements of traditional Norse mythology into the title, with specific stories translated into comics form.<ref name="EternalsSaga2" /> Following Thomas's tenure, ''Thor'' had a changing creative team.

In the mid-1970s, Marvel considered giving the character a second series as part of parent company [[Magazine Management]]'s  [[List of magazines released by Marvel Comics in the 1970s|line of black-and-white comics magazines]]. A story written by [[Steve Englehart]] for the aborted project appeared in ''Thor Annual'' #5 (1976).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steveenglehart.com/comics/Thor%20the%20Mighty.html |title=Thor the Mighty |first=Steve |last=Englehart |authorlink=Steve Englehart |date=n.d. |publisher=SteveEnglehart.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GtiI33b1?url=http://www.steveenglehart.com/comics/Thor%20the%20Mighty.html |archivedate=May 26, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 26, 2013 |quote=Unfortunately, in one of those things that just happen in life, publishing plans changed and ''Thor the Mighty'' was shelved. |df= }}</ref> A black-and-white Thor story appeared in ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #10 (Winter 1977).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/30674/ ''Marvel Preview'' #10] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

[[Walt Simonson]] took over both writing and art as of #337 (Nov. 1983). His stories placed a greater emphasis on the character's mythological origins.<ref>{{cite book|last = Nolen-Weathington|first = Eric|author2=Ash, Roger |title = Modern Masters, Volume 8: Walter Simonson|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|year = 2006|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|page = 45|isbn = 978-1893905641|quote= I combined Norse mythology with 'Marvel Norse mythology' with 'Walter mythology' and put together a storyline.}}</ref>  Simonson's run as writer-artist lasted until #367 (May 1986), although he continued to write – and occasionally draw – the book until issue #382 (Aug. 1987). Simonson's run, which introduced the character [[Beta Ray Bill]], was regarded as a popular and critical success.<ref>DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 213: "This issue began a highly acclaimed run by writer/artist Walt Simonson that would last for nearly four years and end with issue #382 (Aug. 1987)."</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popimage.com/reviews/071001thorsimonsonrev.html |title=Review: Thor Visionaries: Walter Simonson |first=Matt |last=Singer |date=October 1, 2007 |publisher=Popimage.com |accessdate=December 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GrrpIH9t?url=http://www.popimage.com/reviews/071001thorsimonsonrev.html |archivedate=May 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Simonson's later stories were drawn by [[Sal Buscema]], who describes Simonson's stories as "very stimulating.

Working primarily with artist [[Ron Frenz]], DeFalco stayed on the book until #459 (Feb. 1993).

As a consequence of the "[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]] story arc of the 1990s, Thor was removed from mainstream Marvel continuity and with other Marvel characters re-imagined in an [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate universe]] for one year. The ''Thor'' title reverted to ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' with issue #503 (Nov. 1996), and ran four different, sequential features ("The Lost Gods"; "[[Shang-Chi|Master of Kung Fu]]"; "[[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]", and "[[Hannibal King]]") before ceasing publication with #521 (June 1998).

When the character was returned to the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]], Thor was relaunched with ''Thor'' vol. 2, #1 (July 1998).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/thor3.htm#S495|title= ''Thor'' (II) • ''The Mighty Thor'' (II) (1998–2004)|publisher= Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators}}</ref><ref>{{gcdb series|id= 6045|title= Thor ''vol. 2'}}</ref><ref>Manning, Matthew K.

The title ran until issue #85 / #587, dated December 2004. [[Dan Jurgens]] wrote the first 79 issues, with Daniel Berman and [[Michael Avon Oeming]] completing the series.

The third volume debuted as ''Thor'' #1 (Sept. 2007), initially written by [[J.

In July 2016, Marvel announced a new ongoing series titled ''The Unworthy Thor'' by Aaron and Coipel.

Aaron stated that the series finds Odinson in a dark place explaining, "He failed for a reason we still don't quite understand. He dropped the hammer and hasn't been able to pick it up since. So then we go to a pretty dark place. A darker, more desperate, more driven version."<ref>{{cite web |last=Whitbrook |first=James |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-original-god-of-thunder-is-back-and-ready-to-prove-1783289116 |title=The Original God of Thunder Is Back and Ready to Prove Himself in The Unworthy Thor |date=July 7, 2016 |publisher=[[io9]] |accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref>
