'''Paladin''' (often going by '''Paul Denning''') is a fictional character, a [[mercenary]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Though not a [[supervillain]], his mercenary activities often bring him into conflict with [[superhero]]es.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
Paladin first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #150 (January 1978), with follow-up appearances in #152 (May 1978) and #154 (September 1978) as part of the same [[story arc]]. The character had a one-shot story published in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #43 (August 1978),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/32521/ |title=GCD :: Issue :: Marvel Premiere #43 |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> and was a billed guest star in the Spider-Man team-up title ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #108 (August 1981).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/35568/ |title=GCD :: Issue :: Marvel Team-Up #108 |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref>

From there on, Paladin has mostly appeared as a guest star across the Marvel Universe,<ref>http://www.comics.org/character/name/paladin/sort/chrono/</ref> with occasional forays as a superteam member, in ''[[Silver Sable and the Wild Pack]]'', ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' and ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', and occasional feature appearances in the ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' anthology.

==Fictional character biography==
Paladin is a mercenary and private investigator, whose past is largely unrevealed. When first seen, he sought [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] while engaged in an assignment to track down the [[Purple Man]], and battled Daredevil. He clashed with Daredevil a second time after the crime fighter inadvertently interfered with Paladin's search for the Purple Man. Paladin allied with Daredevil in battle against the [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)#Klaus Voorhees|Cobra]], the [[Jester (Jonathan Powers)|Jester]], and [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]], who were under control of the Purple Man.<ref>''Daredevil'' #152, 154</ref>

Paladin next battled the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #43</ref> Paladin aided the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] against [[Baron Brimstone]], acquired a modified uniform, and began a romance with the Wasp.<ref>''Avengers'' #251</ref> Paladin aided the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in battle against the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Avengers'' #271</ref> Paladin allied with [[Spider-Man]] and the Wasp against mobsters; despite respecting Spider-Man's abilities, Paladin is incredulous that Spider-Man offers his heroic services without charge (Paladin literally laughs in Spider-Man's face upon learning this<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #108</ref>), while Spider-Man in turn is disgusted by Paladin's mercenary ways.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #105-106</ref> Paladin also considers Spider-Man's incessant battle banter "unprofessional".<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #6</ref>

Paladin was later employed by [[Silver Sable]] to investigate a conspiracy which threatened her native country of Symkaria, and he allied with Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #320-321</ref> Paladin was then hired by [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] to raid [[Serpent Society]] headquarters. He was captured, but freed by [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #381-382</ref> Paladin accompanied Captain America in his search for Diamondback, the [[Asp (comics)|Asp]], and [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]]. With his new allies, Paladin battled [[Superia]]'s [[Femizons|horde of female superhumans]].<ref>''Captain America'' #386-392</ref>

An unabashed womanizer, Paladin often flirted with whoever woman caught his eye. He briefly dated the Wasp at a time when she was separated from [[Hank Pym]], much to the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]'s jealousy, who was also attracted to her.{{Issue|date=May 2010}} For a time, he also enlisted [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] into helping him retrieve a sword for [[Adrienne Frost]], the sister of current X-Men member [[Emma Frost]].{{Issue|date=May 2010}} During this period, the mutant known as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] was strongly attracted to Paladin, but that affection disappeared when Generation X and Paladin later went their separate ways.{{Issue|date=May 2010}} He has also been a longtime ally to Silver Sable and her Wild Pack organization, working for pay, of course. He once helped them protect a scientist from a kidnapping attempt by the [[Heroes for Hire]], a group he would later join.{{Issue|date=May 2010}} His main opponent was [[Misty Knight]], who seemed to be an equal match.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

Paladin had exhibited a certain amount of honor in some cases. For example, he was once hired by a corrupt government to assist rebels as part of a sting operation. He aided the rebels in a bomb-laying operation at a government facility. When the rebels were caught, his government handler remarked how lucky they were that the bomb had not gone off. Paladin replied, "I'm sorry, that would have been extra," and activated the bomb by remote control while driving away.<ref>''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'', Vol 2, #16</ref>

In the 1990 one-shot ''The Punisher: No Escape'', he was offered 10 million dollars by mobster Vincent Mangano to kill the [[Punisher]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/mangano.htm |title=Vincent Mangano (Punisher foe) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> Paladin agreed to this arrangement, but did not succeed, and in the ensuing fight both of his legs were broken by the [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]].{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

Paladin once took down [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] with a sniper rifle from a helicopter at a great distance. He did so for the FBI, in exchange for getting his record expunged. The hit, while serious, was not fatal; Paladin's sniper attack led to Daredevil's arrest.<ref>''Daredevil'' issue 79 by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] on November 23 2005</ref>

Paladin was a main character in the 2006 ''[[Heroes for Hire#Heroes for Hire (2006)|Heroes for Hire]]'' series, although as Misty Knight said he was just there for the money. As it turns out, he was a traitor to the group, only using the Heroes as a means to hunt down Captain America for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as part of the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

He single-handedly defeated Captain America and the entire Heroes for Hire team, with the exceptions of [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Maria Vasquez|Tarantula]], and [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], who weren't present when the fight took place, with a special gas weapon that affected the nervous system.{{issue|date=March 2014}} He then radioed S.H.I.E.L.D. and told them he had Captain America in custody.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' v2 #2</ref> However, he did not account for [[Shang-Chi]]'s ability to hold his breath over an extended period (thanks to his martial arts training) and was overpowered by him.{{issue|date=March 2014}} Shang-Chi then aided Captain America, who afterwards switched his costume with Paladin, causing S.H.I.E.L.D. to take Paladin instead into custody.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' v2 #3</ref>

In the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Paladin became a member of the post-''[[Secret Invasion]]'' [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], serving as [[Norman Osborn]]'s personal black ops team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19483 |title=The Osborn Supremacy: Thunderbolts |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref>{{Issue|date=May 2010}} Hired to assassinate [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] for 82 million dollars, Paladin broke into H.A.M.M.E.R. headquarters.  However, Elektra overpowered him by choking him with one of her teeth that was loosened when Paladin punched her. Begging for his life, Paladin gave Elektra the key to escape her prison.<ref>''Dark Reign: Elektra'' #1</ref>

During the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of Asgard, Paladin and the other Thunderbolts were sent to Asgard with the mission of stealing the [[Gungnir|Spear of Odin]] for Osborn. After fighting through a contingent of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]], they managed to find the Spear of Odin.{{Issue|date=May 2010}} Paladin, finally having had enough of serving a madman like Osborn, turned on his teammates and tried to take back the object. After being attacked by fellow Thunderbolt Grizzly, Paladin was saved by [[Eric O'Grady|Ant-Man]]. Grizzly then lost the Spear of Odin to Mr. X who in turn was easily defeated by Quicksilver. Ant-Man recovered the Spear of Odin and gave it to Paladin who decided to take the object in order to keep Osborn from using its power for his own ends. Paladin then departed from Asgard after saying goodbye to Ant-Man.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #143</ref>

During the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Paladin is paired with [[Silver Sable]], [[Misty Knight]], and [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] when Daredevil's [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] ninjas end up targeting members of the mafia.<ref>''Shadowland: Blood on the Streets'' #1</ref> Following this, Misty Knight reopens Heroes for Hire under the influence of Puppet Master; Paladin joins the team and soon realizes this and frees Misty from Puppet Master's control with the help from Iron Fist. After the defeat of Puppet Master, Paladin convinces Misty to keep the operation open, but under their terms.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' Vol. 3 #1-5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Paladin's physical strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and durability are all slightly superhuman. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} He is also a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, with knowledge of [[Boxing]],<ref name=":0">''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update'' #3 (September 2007)</ref> [[Judo]],<ref name=":0" /> [[Savate]],<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 3 #6 (July 2011)</ref> and [[Taekwondo]].<ref name=":0" /> In addition, Paladin is a skilled marksman, actor, espionage agent, bodyguard and detective.

While he has been written using lethal force, his preferred weapon is his stun gun, which fires a beam which scrambles the signals within the target's nervous system sufficiently to render most people unconscious. The range and effectiveness are unknown. The gun is equipped so that only Paladin may operate it.

Paladin wears a body-suit of synthetic stretch fabric, and his boots, gloves, helmet, torso, and knee and elbow guards are made of bulletproof composite materials. Paladin's helmet is equipped with a belt activated faceplate which slides down to make the helmet airtight, and has its own one-hour air supply. The lenses in Paladin's helmet can be adjusted for infrared vision.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of [[Moon Knight|Marc Spector]] used the Paladin name for a period of time while working for the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Corporation]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #80</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
Paladin makes his animated debut in the 2017 ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Trevor Devall]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Take Two|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=27|airdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> He is a member of the Wild Pack. In the episode "Take Two", Paladin pretended to rob from Oscorp so that he can fight Spider-Man in order to study his moves. Though he was webbed up, Paladin broke out and joined the Wild Pack into stealing the Neuro Cortex from Horizon High. During Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus' fight with the Wild Pack, Spider-Man tricked Paladin and Battlestar into taking each other out with their weapons. When the Wild Pack is placed in prison, Paladin asked Silver Sable if this was part of the plan. Silver Sable states that their anonymous client has plans for the Neuro Cortex.
