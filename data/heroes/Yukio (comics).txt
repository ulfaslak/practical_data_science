{{nihongo|'''Yukio'''|雪緒}} is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is a [[kunoichi|female ninja]] of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] origin and a supporting character of the [[X-Men]], particularly associated with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>James Egan, ''1000 Facts about Comic Books, Vol. 3'' (2016), p. 87.</ref>

She is portrayed by [[Rila Fukushima]] in the 2013 film ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]'', and by [[Shiori Kutsuna]] in the 2018 film ''[[Deadpool 2]]''.

==Publication history==
Yukio first appeared in ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' #1 (September [[1982 in comics|1982]]), created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].

==Characteristics and abilities==
Within the context of the stories, Yukio is an occasional thief by profession, as well as a [[rōnin]], a masterless [[samurai]]. Yukio has been portrayed as a free spirit with an almost careless disregard for personal safety. According to her own philosophy of life, living in danger is the ultimate adventure, while the peace of death is the final prize that awaits for every person who has truly lived.<ref name="Wolv-3">''Wolverine'' #3</ref> In 2011, [[UGO Networks]] featured her on their list of 25 Hot Ninja Girls, commenting: "While her short, black haircut and skin-tight leather outfit make her come off as a nefarious addition to the X-Men world, Yukio has proven to be quite a helpful non-mutant to Wolverine and his friends."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/girls/hot-ninja-girls?page=4 |title=25 Hot Ninja Girls - Hot Women Ninjas |publisher=UGO.com |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate=2013-11-11}}</ref>

While Yukio is highly skilled in the martial arts, her specialty weapons are scalpel-like [[shuriken]], of which she can hurl up to three at a time with deadly accuracy.<ref name="Wolv-3"></ref> It has been hinted upon by Wolverine that Yukio's real first name could be "Yukiko". However, since Logan joked about it and the fact has since then never again been touched upon, its unclear if Yukiko is Yukio's actual real name or not.<ref>''Wolverine: Soultaker'' miniseries</ref>

==Character history==
The [[X-Men]]'s first encounter with Yukio occurred when [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] had his struggle with [[Shingen Yashida]], father of Wolverine's girlfriend [[Mariko Yashida]]. At that time Yukio worked for Shingen, and one of her tasks was to kill Wolverine. Instead she developed a crush on him and subsequently aided him in bringing about Shingen's downfall.<ref>''Wolverine'' #1-4 (1982)</ref>

Later, Wolverine invited his team to Japan for his wedding to Mariko, which Yukio joined subsequently. [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]] and the [[Silver Samurai]] poisoned the X-Men during a dinner that Logan hosted for them. Logan, tasting the poison, warned Ororo and knocked the cup from her hand before she could drink it. While the others were recuperating from the attack, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Wolverine, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] (who had been largely unaffected), and Yukio went after Viper and the Silver Samurai to stop his plot to assassinate Mariko, who was his half-sister. Yukio posed as a decoy, disguising herself as Mariko to lead them away from her. During their altercation with Viper and Silver Samurai, Storm found her powers inexplicably going out of control, endangering her life. Yukio knocked Storm into the nearby bay, enabling them to escape from the Silver Samurai. (These events had actually been brought about and influenced by the mutant villain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], who was conducting a revenge campaign against the X-Men at the time. He was also responsible for the subsequent halting of Wolverine's and Mariko's wedding). Storm, inspired by what she called Yukio's "madness" and lust for life, changed her image dramatically and adopted a new look: a mohawk haircut, studded collar, and black leather clothing.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #172-173</ref>

Yukio later met up, once again, with Wolverine to help him fight the ninja master [[Ogun (comics)|Ogun]].<ref>"Kitty Pryde & Wolverine."</ref> She developed a rivalry with the X-Man [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]: Both being thieves, they often tried to steal the same object. Yukio once framed Gambit for a crime she committed.<ref>"Wolverine and Gambit"</ref> Yukio is also part of [[Professor X]]'s secret information network of humans and mutants, known as the Mutant Underground (not to be confused with [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s Underground).

After the death of Mariko Yashida, Wolverine sent his adopted daughter, [[Amiko Kobayashi]], to a foster family. He later discovered that her new foster parents were abusive and only interested in the money. Wolverine took Amiko away from them and asked Yukio to raise her. This unofficial adoption was under the protection of the Silver Samurai, now an ally of Wolverine. Yukio trained Amiko in the martial arts and to her own surprise she enjoyed her new role as a mother. When [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] targeted Wolverine's friends and family, he hired [[Omega Red]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]] to kidnap Amiko. Yukio fought the two, but was overpowered and seriously injured, and left her in a wheelchair. She asked Wolverine to kill her, but Wolverine refused and saved Amiko shortly afterwards. Yukio reappeared and was fully recovered from her previous injuries.<ref>''X-treme X-Men'' Arena storyline</ref> She teamed up with Storm again to enter the Arena, a fight club for mutants. In the end, Yukio, Storm, and [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] took over the Arena.

Later, Yukio and Amiko were attacked by Hellverine (a demonic being who had taken over Wolverine's body in order to kill his loved ones) on the behest of Marduk Kurios. Her confusion over the fake Wolverine's behavior earned Yukio serious injuries, but Amiko returned from school just in time to save them both from Hellverine.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.4 #2</ref> When Wolverine goes back to Japan to stop a war between the Hand and the Yakuza, Yukio is shown to be once again in a wheelchair due to Hellverine's attack.<ref>''Wolveine'' vol. 4 #300</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Yukio is shown running an illegal nightclub in Osaka, Japan when it is visited by [[War Machine]] where he asks her about the tech-based ninjas. Yukio states that she can't say anything if she wants her business to stay afloat. After being threatened with the prospect of having the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] storming the place, Yukio points War Machine to a rather big and muscular man in a tuxedo who leaves the nightclub with two ladies entering the car with him.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 2 #6</ref>

===Other versions===
In  ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', a [[Skrull]] masquerades as Yukio on a mission from the [[Shi'ar]] to eliminate [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] and Wolverine. It is killed by Storm's icing powers.<ref>''X-Men: The End'' #5</ref>

Later she helps Negasonic Teenage Warhead and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] in the fight against [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. In the mid-credits, Yukio repairs [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s time travel device for Deadpool. The writers felt free to use the character in whatever way the film needed due to her having only a minor role in the comics.<ref name="Ching"/>

===Video games===
Yukio appears in the video game ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]'', looking for the shattered pieces of the Murasama Blade.

==Reception==
In 2011, [[UGO Networks]] featured her on their list of 25 Hot Ninja Girls, commenting: "While her short, black haircut and skin-tight leather outfit make her come off as a nefarious addition to the X-Men world, Yukio has proven to be quite a helpful non-mutant to Wolverine and his friends."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114014412/http://www.ugo.com/girls/hot-ninja-girls?page=4 |title=25 Hot Ninja Girls - Hot Women Ninjas |publisher=UGO.com |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate=2013-11-11}}</ref>

Christy Lemire, writing for the website of [[Roger Ebert]], described Yukio in ''The Wolverine'' as "frisky and fearless" and a "manga-inspired dream girl", writing that actress Fukushima "more than holds her own opposite the veteran Jackman in both the elaborate fight scenes and the quieter moments".<ref>{{cite web|last=Lemire|first=Christy|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-wolverine-2013 |title=The Wolverine Movie Review & Film Summary (2013) |publisher=Roger Ebert |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref> With respect to her appearance in ''Deadpool 2'', Sergio Pereira, writing for ''[[ScreenRant]]'', felt that Kutsuna's portrayal of Yukio was bad for the character and the franchise, stating that "[a]ll of the character development and progress from ''The Wolverine'' is washed away as Yukio becomes a parody of herself".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/deadpool-movies-casting-decisions-hurt-saved/15/?v=6&n=f|title=9 Casting Decisions That Hurt The Deadpool Movies (And 11 That Saved It)|first=Sergio|last=Pereira|publisher=''[[ScreenRant]]''|date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'', Olivia Truffaut-Wong said that the ''Deadpool 2'' Yukio "doesn't really seem to have a life outside of being one half of the first gay superhero couple onscreen... nor does she have a personality that goes beyond typical depictions of a cute Japanese anime character", although she does note the significance of the character appearing as being in a relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/after-deadpool-2-we-need-to-talk-about-how-asian-women-are-depicted-in-marvel-movies-9131774|title=After 'Deadpool 2', We Need To Talk About How Asian Women Are Depicted In Marvel Movies|publisher=''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]''|first=Olivia|last=Truffaut-Wong|date=May 22, 2018}}</ref>
