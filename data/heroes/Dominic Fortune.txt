'''Dominic Fortune''' is a [[fiction]]al character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Created by [[Howard Chaykin]] and based on the [[Scorpion (Atlas/Seaboard Comics)|Scorpion]], Chaykin's character for the failed [[Atlas/Seaboard Comics]] company,<ref>Ekstrom, Steve. [http://www.newsarama.com/comics/070910-DomFortune.html "Return to Fortune: Chaykin on Dominic Fortune MAX,"] Newsarama (July 10, 2009).</ref> Dominic Fortune was originally a 1930s costumed, fortune-seeking adventurer.

He was part of Marvel's [[Comics Code Authority|Comics Code]]-free black-and-white magazine line. His first two appearances occurred in ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #2 (1975, no month) and ''[[Marvel Super Action]]'' #1 (January 1976), a one-shot magazine. These stories were later reprinted in ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #20 (Winter 1980).

He next appeared as "Dominic Fortune, Brigand For Hire" as a backup feature in ''[[Hulk (comics)#1970s|Hulk]]'' (a full-color magazine, formerly the b/w ''Rampaging Hulk'') #21 - #25 (June 1980 - February 1981), written by [[Denny O'Neil]] with fully painted artwork by Chaykin. Issue #24 (December 1980) contains a short editorial to the effect that although the magazine was reverting to b/w from the following issue, this would be "with the exception of the Dominic Fortune strip which will be in color through its offbeat conclusion in issue #26." Despite this assertion, and an advertisement in issue #25 for a Dominic Fortune story in issue #26, issue #25's story, "Slay Bells", was the last published. Contemporaneously, Fortune appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #56 (October 1980), in a story plotted by [[Len Wein]] and laid out by Chaykin for the never-published ''Marvel Super-Action'' #2, and finished by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]].

Subsequently, an elderly version of the character interacted with modern Marvel heroes in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #120 (August 1982), ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #10 (January 1986), ''[[Iron Man]]'' #212 - #213 (November 1986 - December 1986), and ''Web of Spider-Man'' #71 - #72 (December 1990 - January 1991), with no involvement from Chaykin beyond the cover for ''Web of Spider-Man'' #10.  A flashback tale revealing Fortune's involvement with Captain America's origin appeared in ''Marvel Super Heroes'' (vol. 2) #3 (September 1990)

The next appearance of Dominic Fortune was in ''Sable and Fortune'', a 4-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] published in 2006, written by Brendan Cahill and painted by John Burns (issues #1-3) and Laurenn McCubbin (#4). Originally solicited as a six-issue series, ''Sable and Fortune'' was shortened to four issues after issue #1 was released in March 2006. According to the letters page of #3 (May 2006) the four-part tale was unaffected; the last two issues would have been a separate story. He also appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' (vol. 2) #5 - 12 (February 2008 - October 2008).

In June 2009, a six-part online-only digital comic ''Astonishing Tales: Dominic Fortune'' was published as part of Marvel Comics' digital initiative. Written by [[Dean Motter]] and drawn by [[Greg Scott (comics)|Greg Scott]], it featured Dominic Fortune in tales set during the 1930s. This was followed in October 2009 by a four-part miniseries published under Marvel's mature MAX imprint.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=3162&disp=table</ref> Written and illustrated by [[Howard Chaykin]], this miniseries was also set in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Ekstrom |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/070910-DomFortune.html |title=Return to Fortune: Chaykin on Dominic Fortune MAX |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=July 13, 2009 |accessdate=September 26, 2009}}</ref>

In November 2009, Marvel Comics announced the release of a ''Dominic Fortune'' [[Trade paperback (comics)|Trade Paperback]] book. The title reprints the 2009 MAX series and the digital ''Astonishing Tales: Dominic Fortune'', along with the stories in ''Marvel Preview'' #2 and ''Marvel Premiere'' #56.

In 2010, Dominic Fortune was featured as a supporting character in the series ''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'', which lasted for six issues. He subsequently appeared in the mini-series ''Widowmaker'', which continued a storyline from ''Hawkeye & Mockingbird''.

In 2011, Fortune appeared as part of the 1959 Avengers group in ''New Avengers'' Vol. 2, #10-13, followed by the five issue miniseries ''[[Avengers 1959]]''.

In 2015, Fortune appeared in ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #11 in a story drawn by Chaykin.

==Fictional character biography==

===Duvid "David" Fortunov===
Born in New York, Duvid Jerome Fortunov spent the 1920s until just after the [[Wall Street Crash]] in 1929 on [[New York City]]'s [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]] "lying, cheating and stealing my way through life".<ref name="DF1">''Dominic Fortune'' #1, October 2009</ref> During this time, he saves a young [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] from a group of bullies.<ref name="MSH3">''Marvel Super-Heroes'' Vol. 2 #3, September 1990</ref>

In 1937, in an adventure in Europe he encountered [[Dr. Doom]]'s parents and later [[Captain America]] villains [[Baron Von Strucker]] and [[Baron Zemo]] and spent some time in [[Latveria]] and in [[Wakanda]] in Africa while foiling Nazi weapons intrigues involving the as-yet unnamed mineral [[Vibranium]]. Not long afterwards, having been evicted from his office, he began living aboard the ''Mississippi Queen'' at Sabbath's invitation.<ref name="Astonishing Tales"/> In that same year, he uncovered a Nazi propaganda plot in the comic book industry.<ref>''Hulk'' #21, June 1980</ref>  He also broke up a cult of zombies,<ref>''Hulk'' #22, August 1980</ref> thwarted [[Baron Strucker]]'s attempted assassination of a U.S. senator,<ref>''Hulk'' #23, October 1980</ref> exposed the phony "child star" Tina Timmons,<ref>''Hulk'' #24, December 1980</ref> and rescued the British ambassador from a terrorist.<ref>''Hulk'' #25, February 1981</ref>

Early in 1940, he defeated a group of Nazi saboteurs who had taken over the Dean Brothers Circus in Chicago.<ref name="MSH3"/> Later that same year, he foiled a Nazi plot to steal top secret plans from a munitions factory.<ref>flashback in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #10, January 1986</ref> In May, he lost contact with Sabbath Raven after an argument in a bar in Rotterdam just before the Nazi invasion of the city.<ref name="Web flashback #71">flashback in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #71, December 1990</ref> After failing to find her, Fortune returned to the U.S.<ref name="Web flashback #71"/>   He was rejected as a subject for Project: Rebirth, but helped protect the man who was chosen, Steve Rogers (who would become Captain America) from Nazi agents.<ref name="MSH3"/> In 1942, he met the [[Sub-Mariner]] during the [[Murmansk Run]].<ref>''Avengers 1959'' #4, February 2012</ref> He returned to the war as a G.I. in 1943.<ref name="Web flashback #71"/> In the final days of the war, Fortune was responsible for killing the leader of the [[Dark Ocean Society]],<ref name="Widowmaker #3">''Widowmaker'' #3, March 2011</ref> After the war, he continued his search for Sabbath, but again failed.<ref name="Web flashback #71"/>

In 1959, while in Paris, Fortune was recruited by [[Nick Fury]] to be a member of the "Avengers Initiative". This included working with [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and [[Ulysses Bloodstone]].<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 2) #10, May 2011</ref> After helping to defeat a Neo-Nazi version of the [[Red Skull]] in Sweden, Fortune's criminal record was wiped clean.<ref name="New Avengers #13"/>

Eventually, Fortune returned to America and resumed being David Fortunov. He established himself as a [[Pontiac]] salesman in [[Nassau County, New York]] (becoming 'Nassau County Champion Salesman' in 1965), where he married and had two children.<ref>flashback in ''Iron Man'' #212, November 1986</ref> He eventually retired to Restwell Nursing Home, NY after the death of his wife, but came out of retirement to battle [[Turner D. Century]] alongside [[Spider-Man]],<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #120, August 1982</ref> after which he vowed to take back up his search for Sabbath Raven. Some time after this he left the rest home, then alongside Spider-Man battled the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], who was working for [[Iron Monger#Other Iron Mongers|Simon Steele]], an old adversary of Fortune's who he had been investigating in the hope of finding clues to the fate of Sabbath.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #10, January 1986</ref>

He later aided [[Iron Man]] in his battle with the [[Iron Monger]], once again an employee of Simon Steele. Fortune's son Jerry witnessed the battle and, believing his father killed, swore revenge. Donning his father's costume, Jerry Fortunov became the new Dominic Fortune, though after finding his father still alive he was killed by Steele, taking a shot meant for his father.<ref name="IM212&213">''Iron Man'' #212-213, November/December 1986</ref> Iron Man then informed Fortune that the Sabbath he had seen with Steele while in captivity was in fact Sabbath Raven's daughter Elena by Steele's brother (Sabbath's first husband) Heinrich von Lundt.<ref name="WOS72">''Web of Spider-Man'' #72, January 1991</ref>

Seeking vengeance for his son's murder, with the help of Spider-Man, Dominic Fortune tracked Steele and the younger Sabbath Raven to New York,<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #71, December 1990</ref> only to discover that Steele had married Fortune's Sabbath many years before. Eventually Fortune, Spider-Man and [[Silver Sable]] corner Steele hiding aboard the ageing remains of the ''Mississippi Queen'' and Fortune was reunited with the original Sabbath Raven.<ref name="WOS72"/>

In 1991, Fortune was in [[The Philippines]] for the eruption of [[Mt. Pinatubo]].<ref name="Widowmaker #3"/>

Later, Fortune found and replicated a flawed Super-Soldier serum that Mockingbird helped create. After ingesting it, he was de-aged and lost his memory for a short time.<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #6, January 2011</ref>

In 2006,  the newly de-aged Dominic Fortune joined forces with [[Silver Sable]] to stop the plans of traitors from within Silver Sable's own Wild Pack.<ref>''Sable and Fortune'' #1 - 4, March 2006 - June 2006</ref> At that time Fortune worked as a P.I., but was also shown to be working with a government black ops group called the [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)#Vanguard|Vanguard]].<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' (vol. 2) #5 - 12, February 2008 - October 2008</ref>

After he regained his memory and aged overnight, he decided to join Mockingbird's organization, the [[World Counter-terrorism Agency]] to stay close to her, making sure the Super-Soldier serum's creator was there to help him if the side-effects got worse.<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #1-6, August 2010 - January 2011; ''Widowmaker'' #1-4, February 2011 - April 2011</ref>

In 2015, he was revealed to have again aged (although still younger than his actual 100+ years) and living back on board the Mississippi Queen, left to him by the deceased Sabbath Raven. He enlisted the help of S.H.I.E.L.D. field director [[Phil Coulson]] to help him reacquire the ship after losing it while gambling with [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] agent Tug Freehand.<ref name="S.H.I.E.L.D. #11"/>

===Jerry Fortunov===
When Jerry Fortunov thought that his father had been killed, he swore vengeance on the Iron Monger. Donning his father's costume, Jerry Fortunov became the new Dominic Fortune. Jerry Fortunov's career as Dominic Fortune was short. Discovering that his father was alive Jerry, with help from Iron Man, attacked the estate of Simon Steele. He was fatally injured in the battle, shot by Simon Steele, and died in his father's arms.<ref name="IM212&213"/>

==Abilities and equipment==
In his prime, David Fortunov was an athletic man. He was also a superb hand-to-hand combatant and excellent boxer, and an expert marksman and swordsman. In modern times, despite his advanced age, David is in excellent physical condition and still retains much of his physical skills; he does, however, tire easily.

While less physically skilled than his father, Jerry Fortunov was a skilled tax lawyer with some training in marksmanship.

Dominic Fortune uses a variety of handguns, particularly the [[Mauser C96]], using 9&nbsp;mm [[9×19mm Parabellum|parabellum]] ammunition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
