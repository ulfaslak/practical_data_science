'''Captain America''' ('''Steve Rogers''') is a [[character (fiction)|fictional superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[cartoonists]] [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[#Golden Age|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover date]]d March 1941) from [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a [[American patriotism|patriotic]] [[supersoldier]] who often fought the [[Axis powers]] of [[World War II]] and was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war and the ''Captain America'' comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.

The character wears a costume bearing an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]], and he utilizes a [[Captain America's shield|nearly indestructible shield which he throws as a projectile]]. Captain America is the [[alter ego]] of '''Steve Rogers''', a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the [[United States]] government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in [[Cryopreservation|suspended animation]] until he was revived in the present day. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time with its modern realities, he remains a highly respected figure in his community which includes becoming the long-time leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Captain America was the first Marvel Comics character to appear in media outside comics with the release of the 1944 [[Serial (film)|movie serial]], ''[[Captain America (serial)|Captain America]]''. Since then, the character has been featured in [[Captain America in other media|other films and television series]]. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), the character is portrayed by [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'', ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).

Captain America is ranked sixth on [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time" in 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/6|title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes|date= 2011|publisher=IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150630173526/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/6|archivedate= June 30, 2015|deadurl= no|accessdate= July 9, 2015}}</ref> second in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/2|date= April 30, 2012 |title= The Top 50 Avengers|publisher=IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151129171205/http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/2|archivedate= November 29, 2015|deadurl= no|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> and second in their "Top 25 best Marvel superheroes" list in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.uk.ign.com/articles/2014/09/10/top-25-best-marvel-superheroes|title=Top 25 Best Marvel Superheroes|first1= Joshua|last1= Yehl|first2= Jeff|last2= Lake|date= September 10, 2014|publisher= IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141031191046/http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/09/10/top-25-best-marvel-superheroes|archivedate= October 31, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate= October 19, 2015}}</ref>

==Publication history==
{{further|List of Captain America titles}}

===Creation===
In 1940, writer Joe Simon conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume.<ref>1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program, cover</ref> "I wrote the name 'Super American' at the bottom of the page," Simon said in his autobiography, and then decided:

{{quote|No, it didn't work. There were too many "Supers" around. "Captain America" had a good sound to it. There weren't a lot of captains in comics. It was as easy as that. The boy companion was simply named Bucky, after my friend Bucky Pierson, a star on our high school basketball team.<ref name=joesimonp50>{{Cite book |last= Simon|first= Joe|author2=Simon, Jim|title= The Comic Book Makers|publisher= Crestwood/II|year= 1990|page= 50|isbn= 978-1-887591-35-5}} Reissued by Vanguard Productions in 2003.</ref>}}

Simon recalled in his autobiography that [[Timely Comics]] publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] gave him the go-ahead and directed that a Captain America solo comic book series be published as soon as possible. Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character's stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist [[Jack Kirby]], could handle the workload alone:

{{quote|I didn't have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue&nbsp; ... There were two young artists from [[Connecticut]] that had made a strong impression on me. [[Al Avison]] and [[Al Gabriele]] often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other. Actually, their work was not too far from [that of] Kirby's. If they worked on it, and if one inker tied the three styles together, I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform. The two Als were eager to join in on the new ''Captain America'' book, but Jack Kirby was visibly upset. "You're still number one, Jack," I assured him. "It's just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue."

"I'll make the deadline," Jack promised. "I'll pencil it [all] myself and make the deadline." I hadn't expected this kind of reaction&nbsp; ... but I acceded to Kirby's wishes and, it turned out, was lucky that I did. There might have been two Als, but there was only one Jack Kirby ... I wrote the first ''Captain America'' book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards, with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds. Kirby did his thing, building the muscular anatomy, adding ideas and popping up the action as only he could. Then he tightened up the penciled drawings, adding detailed backgrounds, faces and figures."<ref name=joesimonp50 />}}[[File:1974ComicArtCon book.jpg|thumb|1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program featuring Simon's original sketch of Captain America.]]
Al Lieberman would ink that first issue, which was lettered by Simon and Kirby's regular letterer, Howard Ferguson.<ref>Simon, p. 51.</ref>

Simon said Captain America was a consciously political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of [[Nazi Germany]] in the years leading up to the United States' involvement in [[World War II]] and felt war was inevitable: "The opponents to the war were all quite well organized. We wanted to have our say too."<ref name="Wright 36">{{Cite book |last= Wright| first= Bradford W.|title=Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America | publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|year= 2001|location= Baltimore, Maryland|isbn= 978-0-8018-7450-5|page= 36}}</ref>

Simon noted, "When the first issue came out we got a lot of&nbsp; ... threatening letters and hate mail. Some people really opposed what Cap stood for."<ref name="Wright 36"/> The threats, which included menacing groups of people loitering out on the street outside of the offices, proved so serious that police protection was posted with [[Mayor of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Fiorello La Guardia]] personally contacting Simon and Kirby to give his support.<ref>{{cite book|last = Cronin|first = Brian|title = Was Superman a Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed|publisher = [[Plume (publisher)|Plume]]|year = 2009|location= New York, New York|pages = 135–136|isbn = 978-0-452-29532-2}}</ref>

Though preceded as a "patriotically themed superhero" by [[Archie Comics|MLJ]]'s [[The Shield (Archie)|The Shield]], Captain America immediately became the most prominent and enduring of that wave of superheroes introduced in American comic books prior to and during World War II,<ref name="Sanderson18">{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1940s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 18|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Cap was not the first patriotically themed super hero, but he would become the most enduring. He was Timely's most popular hero with nearly a million copies of his comic sold per month.}}</ref> as evidenced by the unusual move at the time of premiering the character in his own title instead of an anthology title first. This popularity drew the attention and a complaint from MLJ that the character's triangular shield too closely resembled the chest symbol of their Shield character. In response, Goodman had Simon and Kirby create a distinctive round shield for issue 2, which went on to become an iconic element of the character.<ref>Cronin, p. 134</ref> With his sidekick [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]], Captain America faced [[Nazism|Nazis]], [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]], and other threats to wartime America and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Stanley Lieber, now better known as [[Stan Lee]], contributed to the character in issue #3 in the filler text story "Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge", which introduced the character's use of his shield as a returning throwing weapon.<ref name="AmazingMarvelUniverse">{{Cite book |last= Thomas|first= Roy|authorlink = Roy Thomas|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe| publisher= [[Sterling Publishing]]|location= New York, New York|year= 2006|page= 11|isbn= 978-1-4027-4225-5|quote= The line reads: "With the speed of thought, he sent his shield spinning through the air to the other end of the tent, where it smacked the knife out of Haines' hand!" It became a convention starting the following issue, in which the art in a Simon and Kirby comics story illustrates the following caption: "Captain America's speed of thought and action save Bucky's life — as he hurls his shield across the room.}}</ref> Captain America soon became Timely's most popular character and even had a fan-club called the "Sentinels of Liberty".<ref name="Wright 36"/>

Circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue, which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' during the period.<ref name="Sanderson18" /><ref>{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher = [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]]|year = 1991|location= New York, New York|page = 37|isbn = 9780810938212}}</ref> After the Simon and Kirby team moved to [[DC Comics]] in late 1941, having produced ''Captain America Comics'' through issue #10 (January 1942), [[Al Avison]] and [[Syd Shores]] became regular [[penciller]]s of the celebrated title, with one generally [[inker|inking]] over the other. The character was featured in ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' #1–19 (Summer 1941 – Fall 1946), ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #80–84 and #86–92, ''[[USA Comics]]'' #6–17 (Dec. 1942 – Fall 1945), and ''[[All Select Comics]]'' #1–10 (Fall 1943 – Summer 1946).

In the post-war era, with the popularity of superheroes fading, Captain America led Timely's first superhero team, the [[All-Winners Squad]], in its two published adventures, in ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' #19 and #21 (Fall–Winter 1946; there was no issue #20). After Bucky was shot and wounded in a 1948 ''Captain America'' story, he was succeeded by Captain America's girlfriend, Betsy Ross, who became the superheroine [[Golden Girl (Timely Comics)|Golden Girl]]. ''Captain America Comics'' ran until issue #73 (July 1949),<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 237|title= Captain America Comics}}</ref> at which time the series was retitled '''''Captain America's Weird Tales'''''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> for two issues,<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 238|title= Captain America's Weird Tales}}</ref> with the finale being a horror/suspense anthology issue with no superheroes.

[[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] attempted to revive its superhero titles when it reintroduced Captain America, along with the original Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner, in ''Young Men'' #24 (Dec. 1953). Billed as "Captain America, Commie Smasher!"<!--note: This is a cover nickname on all his 1950s comics, and presented in all caps like "Daredevil, The Man Without Fear". And in any case, "Commie," short for "Communist," a proper noun, is always capped--> Captain America appeared during the next year in ''Young Men'' #24–28 and ''Men's Adventures'' #27–28, as well as in issues #76–78 of an eponymous title. Atlas' attempted superhero revival was a commercial failure,<ref>Wright, p. 123.</ref> and the character's title was canceled with ''Captain America'' #78 (Sept. 1954).

===Silver and Bronze Age===

In the [[Human Torch]] story titled "Captain America" in Marvel Comics' ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #114 (Nov. 1963),<ref>[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 95: "As the Human Torch had been instrumental in bringing back the Sub-Mariner in ''The Fantastic Four'' #4 (May 1962), it seemed only natural that he would help usher in Captain America."</ref> writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]] depicted the brash young [[Fantastic Four]] member Johnny Storm, the Human Torch, in an exhibition performance with Captain America, described as a legendary World War II and 1950s superhero who has returned after many years of apparent retirement. The 18-page story ends with this Captain America revealed as an impostor: it was actually the villain the Acrobat, a former circus performer the Torch had defeated in ''Strange Tales'' #106, who broke two thieves out of jail, hoping to draw the police away while trying to rob the local bank. Afterward, Storm digs out an old comic book in which Captain America is shown to be Steve Rogers. A caption in the final panel says this story was a test to see if readers would like Captain America to return. According to Lee, fan response to the tryout was very enthusiastic.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 9|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

Captain America was then formally reintroduced in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #4 (March 1964),<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 99: "'Captain America lives again!' announced the cover of ''The Avengers'' #4. A mere [four] months after his imposter had appeared in ''Strange Tales'' #114, the real Cap was back."</ref> which explained that in the final days of World War II, he had fallen from an experimental [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone plane]] into the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] and spent decades frozen in a block of ice in a state of [[suspended animation]]. The hero found a new generation of readers as leader of that superhero team. Following the success of other Marvel characters introduced during the 1960s, Captain America was recast as a hero "haunted by past memories, and trying to adapt to 1960s society".<ref>Wright, p. 215.</ref>

After then guest-starring in the feature "[[Iron Man]]" in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #58 (Oct. 1964), Captain America gained his own solo feature in that "split book", beginning the following issue.<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 103</ref> Issue #63 (March 1965), which retold Captain America's origin, through issue #71 (Nov. 1965) was a period feature set during World War II and co-starred Captain America's Golden Age sidekick, Bucky. Kirby drew all but two of the stories in ''Tales of Suspense,'' which became ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' with #100 (April 1968);<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 128: "Hailing 1968 as the beginning of the 'Second Age of Marvel Comics,' and with more titles to play with, editor Stan Lee discarded his split books and gave more characters their own titles: ''Tales of Suspense'' #99 was followed by ''Captain America'' #100."</ref> [[Gil Kane]] and [[John Romita Sr.]], each filled in once. Several stories were finished by penciller-inker [[George Tuska]] over Kirby layouts, with one finished by Romita Sr. and another by penciller [[Dick Ayers]] and inker [[John Tartaglione]]. Kirby's regular inkers on the series were [[Frank Giacoia]] (as "Frank Ray") and [[Joe Sinnott]], though [[Don Heck]] and Golden Age Captain America artist [[Syd Shores]] inked one story each.

This series — considered ''Captain America'' volume one by comics researchers and historians,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/capamer2.htm#S35 | title= ''Captain America'' (1968–1996) |publisher=The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators}} and {{gcdb series|id= 1860|title= Captain America}}</ref> following the 1940s ''Captain America Comics'' and its 1950s numbering continuation of ''Tales of Suspense'' — ended with #454 (Aug. 1996).

==Legal status==
In 1966, Joe Simon sued the owners of Marvel Comics, asserting that he—not Marvel—was legally entitled to renew the [[copyright]] upon the expiration of the original 28-year term. The two parties settled out of court, with Simon agreeing to a statement that the character had been created under terms of employment by the publisher, and therefore it was [[work for hire]] owned by them.<ref name=philly>{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiabar.org/page/TPLSummer03CaptainAmerica|work=The Philadelphia Lawyer| publisher= Philadelphia Bar Association |accessdate= August 6, 2013|title=The Struggle for Captain America|last=Lovitz|first=Michael | archivedate= December 2, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222355/http://www.philadelphiabar.org/page/TPLSummer03CaptainAmerica | deadurl=no}}</ref>

In 1999, Simon filed to claim the copyright to Captain America under a provision of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which allowed the original creators of works that had been sold to corporations to reclaim them after the original 56-year copyright term (but not the longer term enacted by the new legislation) had expired. Marvel Entertainment challenged the claim, arguing that the settlement of Simon's 1966 suit made the character ineligible for termination of the copyright transfer. Simon and Marvel settled out of court in 2003, in a deal that paid Simon royalties for merchandising and licensing use of the character.<ref name=philly/><ref>{{cite news|title= Joe Simon, a Creator of Captain America, Fighting On|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/books/16gust.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|work= [[The New York Times]]|first= George Gene|last= Gustines|date= April 16, 2008|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6eFsUGRAR?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/books/16gust.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1|archivedate= January 3, 2016|deadurl= no|accessdate= August 6, 2013|df= }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===20th century===
====1940s====
[[File:Captainamerica1.jpg|thumb|''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941). Cover art by [[Joe Simon]] (inks and pencils) and [[Jack Kirby]] (pencils).|alt=The front page of the first Captain America comic depicts Captain America punching [[Adolf Hitler]] in the jaw. A Nazi soldier's bullet deflects from Captain America's shield, while Adolf Hitler falls onto a map of the [[United States|United States of America]] and a document reading 'Sabotage plans for U.S.A.']]
Steven Rogers was born in the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], in 1920 to poor [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, Sarah and Joseph Rogers.<ref name="sentinel">{{cite comic| writer= [[Fabian Nicieza|Nicieza, Fabian]]|penciller= [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Maguire, Kevin]]|inker= [[Josef Rubinstein|Rubinstein, Joe]]|story= First Flight of the Eagle|title= The Adventures of Captain America|issue= 1|date= September 1991}}</ref> Joseph died when Steve was a child, and Sarah died of pneumonia while Steve was a teen. By early 1940, before America's entry into [[World War II]], Rogers is a tall, scrawny [[fine art]]s student specializing in illustration and a comic book writer and artist.

Disturbed by [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]], Rogers attempts to enlist but is rejected due to his frail body. His resolution attracts the notice of U.S. Army General [[Chester Phillips]] and "Project: Rebirth". Rogers is used as a test subject for the [[Supersoldier|Super-Soldier]] project, receiving a special serum made by "Dr. Josef Reinstein",<ref name="captainamericacomics1">{{cite comic| writer= [[Joe Simon|Simon, Joe]]; [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Liederman, Al|story= Case No. 1.

The serum is a success and transforms Steve Rogers into a nearly perfect human being with peak strength, agility, stamina, and intelligence. The success of the program leaves Erskine wondering about replicating the experiment on other human beings.<ref name="modernorigin"/> The process itself has been inconsistently detailed: While in the original material Rogers is shown receiving injections of the Super-Serum, when the origin was retold in the 1960s, the [[Comic Code Authority]] had already put a veto over graphic description of drug intake and abuse, and thus the Super-Serum was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] into an oral formula.<ref name="tos origin">{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]]|story= The Origin of Captain America!|title= [[Tales of Suspense]]|issue= 63|date= March 1965}}</ref> Later accounts hint at a combination of oral and intravenous treatments with a strenuous training regimen, culminating in the Vita-Ray exposure.

Erskine refused to write down every crucial element of the treatment, leaving behind a flawed, imperfect knowledge of the steps. Thus, when the Nazi [[secret agent|spy]] [[Heinz Kruger]] killed him, Erskine's method of creating new Super-Soldiers died. Captain America, in his first act after his transformation, avenges Erskine. In the 1941 origin story and in ''Tales of Suspense'' #63, Kruger dies when running into machinery but is not killed by Rogers; in the ''Captain America'' #109 and #255 revisions, Rogers causes the spy's death by punching him into machinery.<ref name="modernorigin"/>

Unable to create new Super-Soldiers and willing to hide the Project Rebirth fiasco, the American government casts Rogers as a patriotic superhero, able to counter the menace of the [[Red Skull]] as a [[counter-intelligence]] agent. He is supplied with a patriotic uniform of his own design,<ref name="sentinel"/> a bulletproof shield, a personal [[side arm]], and the codename Captain America, while posing as a clumsy [[infantry]] private at Camp Lehigh in Virginia. He forms a friendship with the camp's teenage [[mascot]], James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes.<ref name="captainamericacomics1"/>

Barnes learns of Rogers' [[secret identity|dual identity]] and offers to keep the secret if he can become Captain America's [[sidekick]]. During their adventures, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] presents Captain America with [[Captain America's shield|a new shield]], forged from an alloy of [[steel]] and [[vibranium]], fused by an unknown catalyst, so effective that it replaces his own firearm.<ref name="stern origin"/> Throughout World War II, Captain America and Bucky fight the Nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] as seen in the 1970s comic of the same name.<ref name="invaders">{{cite comic| writer= [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]]|penciller= [[Frank Robbins|Robbins, Frank]]|inker= [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]]|story= A Captain Called America|title= [[Invaders (comics)|Giant-Size Invaders]]|issue= 1|date= June 1975}}</ref> Captain America fights in numerous battles in World War II, primarily as a member of 1st Battalion, [[26th Infantry Regiment]] "Blue Spaders".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.army.mil/article/142301/|title= From 'Blue Spader' to Avenger: Marvel superhero Captain America served with the 'Big Red One'|first= J.

In addition to Bucky, Captain America was occasionally assisted by the [[Sentinels of Liberty]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dittmer|first=Jason|title= 'America is safe while its boys and girls believe in its creeds!': Captain America and American identity prior to World War 2|journal= [[Environment and Planning|Environment and Planning D: Society and Space]]|date=March 23, 2007|volume=25|pages=401–423|doi=10.1068/d1905}}</ref> Sentinels of Liberty was the title given to members of the ''Captain America Comics'' fan club who Captain America sometimes addressed as an aside, or as characters in the ''Captain America Comics'' stories.

In late April 1945, during the closing days of World War II, Captain America and Bucky try to stop the villainous [[Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]] from destroying an experimental drone plane. Zemo launches the plane with an armed explosive on it with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit. The pair reaches the plane just before take off. When Bucky tries to defuse the bomb, it explodes in mid-air. Rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic. Both are presumed dead, though it is later revealed that neither one died.<ref name="theavengers4"/>

====Late 1940s to 1950s====
Captain America appeared in comics for the next few years, changing from World War II-era hero fighting the Nazis to confronting the United States' newest enemy, [[Communism]]. The revival of the character in the mid-1950s was short-lived, and events during that time period are later retconned to show that multiple people operated using the code name to explain the changes in the character. These post World War II successors are listed as [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|William Naslund]] and [[Jeffrey Mace]].

The last of these other official Captains, William Burnside,<ref name="cap602">{{cite comic| writer= [[Ed Brubaker|Brubaker, Ed]]|penciller= [[Luke Ross|Ross, Luke]]|inker= [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Butch]]; Ross, Luke|story= Two Americas Part 1|title= Captain America|issue= 602|date= March 2010}}</ref> was a history graduate enamored with the Captain America mythos, having his appearance surgically altered to resemble Rogers and legally changing his name to "Steve Rogers", becoming the new "1950s Captain America".<ref name="CA153">{{cite comic| writer= [[Steve Englehart|Englehart, Steve]]|penciller= [[Sal Buscema|Buscema, Sal]]|inker= [[Jim Mooney|Mooney, Jim]]|story= Captain America—Hero Or Hoax?|title= Captain America|issue= 153|date= September 1972}}</ref> He administered to himself and his pupil [[Jack Monroe (comics)|James "Jack" Monroe]] a flawed, incomplete copy of the Super-Serum, which made no mention about the necessary Vita-Ray portion of the treatment. As a result, while Burnside and Monroe became the new Captain America and Bucky, they became violently paranoid, often raving about innocent people being communist sympathizers during the height of the [[Red Scare]] of the 1950s. Their insanity forced the U.S. government to place them in indefinite cryogenic storage until they could be cured of their mental illness.<ref name="CA156">{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= [[Frank McLaughlin (artist)|McLaughlin, Frank]]|story= One Into Two Won't Go!|title= Captain America|issue= 156|date= December 1972}}</ref> Monroe would later be cured and assume the Nomad identity.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[J.

====1960s to 1970s====
Years later, the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] discovers Steve Rogers' body in the North Atlantic. After he revives, they piece together that Rogers has been preserved in a block of ice since 1945, surviving because of his enhancements from Project: Rebirth. The block began to melt after the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], enraged that an [[Inuit]] tribe is worshipping the frozen figure, throws it into the ocean.<ref name="theavengers4">{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]|story= Captain America Joins&nbsp; ...

Captain America is plagued by guilt for having been unable to prevent Bucky's death. Although he takes the young [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] (who closely resembles Bucky) under his tutelage, he refuses for some time to allow Jones to take up the Bucky identity, not wishing to be responsible for another youth's death. Insisting that his hero move on from that loss, Jones convinces Rogers to let him don the Bucky costume,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= [[Jim Steranko|Steranko, Jim]]|inker= [[Joe Sinnott|Sinnott, Joe]]|story= No Longer Alone!|title= Captain America|issue= 110|date= February 1969}}</ref> but this partnership lasts only a short time; a disguised [[Red Skull]], impersonating Rogers with the help of the [[Cosmic Cube]], drives Jones away.

Rogers reunites with his old war comrade [[Nick Fury]], who is similarly well-preserved due to the "Infinity Formula". As a result, Rogers regularly undertakes missions for the security agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], for which Fury is public director.<ref name="tos78">{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Giacoia, Frank|story= Them!|title= Tales of Suspense|issue= 78|date= June 1966}}</ref> Through Fury, Rogers befriends [[Sharon Carter]], a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby,, Jack; Ayers, Dick|inker= [[John Tartaglione|Tartaglione, John]]|story= 30 Minutes to Live!|title= Tales of Suspense|issue= 75|date= March 1966}}</ref> with whom he eventually begins a romantic relationship.

During the "[[Time Runs Out]]" storyline, Steve Rogers wears armor when he confronts Iron Man. The ensuing fight between the two old friends led Steve Rogers to force Iron Man to admit that he had lied to him and all of their allies, when he had known about the incursions between alternate Earths all along, but Iron Man also confessed that he wouldn't change a thing. The final incursion started and Earth-1610 started approaching Earth-616 while Iron Man and Steve Rogers kept fighting. Earth-1610's S.H.I.E.L.D. launched a full invasion to destroy Earth-616, where Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were crushed by a Helicarrier.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Hickman, Jonathan|penciller= [[Stefano Caselli|Caselli, Stefano]]; [[Kev Walker|Walker, Kev]]|inker= Caselli, Stefano; Walker, Kev|story= One Was Life.

Steve Rogers later has an encounter with an alternate [[Old Man Logan|Logan from Earth-807128]]. After defeating Logan and bringing him to Alberta, Canada, Rogers tried to "reassure" Logan that this was not "his" past by showing him the adamantium-frozen body of Earth-616's Logan. This sight reminds Logan of the need to enjoy being alive rather than brooding over the ghosts of his past. Although he told Steve Rogers what he had experienced in his timeline, Logan declined Steve's offer of help.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Jeff Lemire|Lemire, Jeff]]|penciller= Sorrentino, Andrea|inker= Sorrentino, Andrea|story= Berserker: Part Four|title= Old Man Logan|volume= 2|issue= 4|date= June 2016}}</ref>

During the 2016 "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, Steve Rogers learns from Rick Jones that S.H.I.E.L.D. has established Pleasant Hill, a gated community where they use Kobik to transform villains into ordinary citizens. When Rogers is brought to Pleasant Hill, he confronts Maria Hill about the Kobik project. Their argument is interrupted when Baron Helmut Zemo and Fixer restore the inmates to normal.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Spencer, Nick|penciller= Saiz, Jesus|inker= Saiz, Jesus|title= [[Avengers: Standoff!]]: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha|issue= 1|date= May 2016}}</ref> After Hill is injured, Rogers convinces Zemo to let Hill get medical attention.

During an attempt to reason with Kobik, Rogers is attacked by Crossbones. Before Rogers can be killed, Kobik uses her abilities to restore him back to his prime.

In ''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #1 (July 2016), the final panel apparently revealed that Rogers has been a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] double-agent since his early youth.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Spencer, Nick|penciller= Saiz, Jesus|inker= Saiz, Jesus|title= Captain America: Steve Rogers|issue= 1|date= July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Eliana|last= Dockterman|url= http://time.com/4347224/captain-america-hydra-agent-marvel-tom-brevoort/|title= Captain America Is a Hydra Agent: Marvel Editor Explains|work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date= May 25, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161010050418/http://time.com/4347224/captain-america-hydra-agent-marvel-tom-brevoort/|archivedate= October 10, 2016|deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/25/captain-america-villain-hydra-nick-spencer-tom-brevoort?xid=entertainment-weekly_socialflow_twitter|title= Marvel's Nick Spencer, Tom Brevoort talk making Captain America a Hydra plant|first= Christian|last= Holub|date= May 25, 2016|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161105105650/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/25/captain-america-villain-hydra-nick-spencer-tom-brevoort?xid=entertainment-weekly_socialflow_twitter|archivedate= November 5, 2016|deadurl= no}}</ref> This is subsequently revealed to be the result of Kobik's restoration of Rogers' youth, as she had been taught by the Red Skull that Hydra was good for the world, and having the mind of a four-year-old child, Kobik changed reality so that Rogers would be the greatest man he could be: believing Hydra to be good, Kobik permanently altered his memories so that Rogers believed that he had always been a member of Hydra.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Spencer, Nick|penciller= Saiz, Jesus|inker= Saiz, Jesus|title= Captain America: Steve Rogers|issue= 2|date= August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/29904-how-steve-rogers-became-a-hydra-agent-spoilers.html|title=How Steve Rogers Became a Hydra Agent – Spoilers |first= George|last= Marston|publisher=Newsarama|date= June 28, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160806221228/http://www.newsarama.com/29904-how-steve-rogers-became-a-hydra-agent-spoilers.html|archivedate= August 6, 2016|deadurl= no}}</ref> Some of Rogers' original heroic attributes remain intact, such as covering the death of another Hydra member within S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Erik Selvig]], as well as knowing of [[Jack Flag]]'s tragic life and his immortality, which is why Steve pushes him from Zemo's airplane (resulting in coma, not death). Additionally, it is revealed that Rogers' abusive father, Joseph, was actually killed by Hydra, and that Hydra deceived him into thinking Joseph died of a heart attack.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Spencer, Nick|penciller= Saiz, Jesus|inker= Saiz, Jesus|title= Captain America: Steve Rogers|issue= 3|date= September 2016}}</ref> It is also revealed that Rogers witnessed his mother, Sarah, being killed by Sinclair's Hydra goons and kidnapped him, which is the reason why Steve held a grudge towards Hydra's evilness and plans to kill the Red Skull's clone and restore Hydra's lost honor.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Spencer, Nick|penciller= Pina, Javier; Sepulveda, Miguel Angel|inker= Pina, Javier; Sepulveda, Miguel Angel|title= Captain America: Steve Rogers|issue= 4|date= October 2016}}</ref> As part of his long-term plans, Steve further compromised Sam Wilson's current image as 'the' Captain America by using his greater familiarity with the shield to deliberately put Wilson in a position where he would be unable to use the shield to save a senator from [[Flag-Smasher]], with the final goal of demoralizing Sam to the point where he will return the shield to Rogers of his own free will, not wanting to kill Wilson and risk creating a martyr.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Spencer, Nick|penciller= Renaud, Paul|inker= Renaud, Paul|story= Take Back the Shield Part 1|title= Captain America: Sam Wilson|issue= 14|date= December 2016}}</ref>

During the 2016 "[[Civil War II]]" storyline, with the discovery of new Inhuman [[Ulysses (comics)#Ulysses Cain|Ulysses]] – who has the ability to "predict" the future by calculating complex patterns – Rogers has set out to prevent Ulysses from learning of his true plans and allegiance. Rogers does this by "forcing" certain predictions on him, such as anonymously providing Bruce Banner with new gamma research to provoke a vision that would drive the Avengers to kill Banner, although this plan has apparently backfired with a recent vision showing the new [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]] standing over the dead Steve Rogers.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Spencer, Nick|penciller= Pina, Javier|inker= Pina, Javier|title= Captain America: Steve Rogers|issue= 5|date= November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Marquez, David|inker= Marquez, David|title= [[Civil War II]]|issue= 5|date= November 2016}}</ref> Despite this revelation, Rogers presents himself as the voice of reason by allowing Spider-Man to flee with Thor. This inspires doubt in Tony Stark for his current stance by suggesting that he is just acting against Danvers because he does not like being top dog.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Spencer, Nick|penciller= Pina, Javier|inker= Pina, Javier|title= Captain America: Steve Rogers|issue= 6|date= December 2016}}</ref> He then goes to [[Washington, D.C.]], the location seen in Ulysses' vision, to talk to Spider-Man, who was trying to understand the vision like he was. When Captain Marvel attempts to arrest Spider-Man, Tony, wearing the War Machine armor, confronts her and the two begin to fight.<ref>''Civil War II'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Rogers goes to Sokovia and joins forces with Black Widow to liberate freedom fighters from a prison so they can reclaim their country. After that, he goes to his base where Doctor Selvig expresses concern of his plan to kill the Red Skull. He then reveals that he has Baron Zemo in a cell, planning to recruit him.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> He eventually kills the Skull after the villain is captured by the Unity Squad and the Xavier brain fragment extracted by the Beast, Rogers throwing the Skull out of a window over a cliff after Sin and Crossbones affirm their new allegiance to Rogers.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' vol.1 #15</ref>

In the 2017 "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Rogers, as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D, uses a subsequent alien invasion and a mass supervillain assault in order to neutralize the superheroes that might oppose him,<ref>''Secret Empire'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref> and seeks the Cosmic Cube to bring about a reality in which Hydra won World War II.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Rick smuggles information about the Cube's rewriting of Rogers' reality to the remaining free Avengers, a disheveled, bearded man in a torn World War II army uniform appears who introduces himself as Steve Rogers.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the Avengers and Hydra search for fragments of the shattered Cube, it is revealed that this amnesic Steve Rogers is actually a manifestation of Rogers existing within the Cube itself, created by Kobik's memories of Rogers before he was converted to Hydra, as she comes to recognize that her decision to 'rewrite' Rogers as an agent of Hydra was wrong.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #9</ref> Although Hydra Rogers is able to mostly reassemble the Cosmic Cube, Sam Wilson and Bucky are able to use a fragment of the cube to restore the 'memory' of pre-Hydra Rogers in the Cube to corporeal existence, allowing him to defeat his Hydra self, subsequently using the Cube to undo most of the damage caused by Hydra manipulating reality even if the physical damage remains.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #10</ref> 'Hydra Cap' continues to exist as a separate entity and is kept trapped in a prison where he is the only inmate, mocking the restored Rogers about the challenge he will face rebuilding his reputation even as Rogers muses that this experience will teach everyone not to place such blind trust in another.<ref>''Secret Empire: Omega'' #1</ref>

==Abilities==
[[File:CAtransformation.png|thumb|Steve Rogers' physical transformation, from a reprint of ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941). Art and story by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]].]]

===Tactician and field commander===
Rogers' battle experience and training make him an expert [[Military tactics|tactician]] and an excellent field commander, with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle. Thor has stated that Rogers is one of the very few humans he will take orders from and follow "through the gates of Hades".<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]|penciller= Zeck, Mike|inker= Beatty, John|story= The War Begins|title= [[Secret Wars|Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars]]|issue= 1|date= May 1984}}</ref> Rogers' reflexes and senses are extraordinarily keen. He has blended [[Aikido]], [[Boxing]],<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol 1 #2 (February 1983)</ref> [[Judo]],<ref name=CaptainAmericaMartialArts>''The Avengers'' vol 1 #5 (May 1964)</ref> [[Karate]],<ref name=CaptainAmericaMartialArts /> [[Jujutsu]], [[Kickboxing]], and gymnastics into his own unique fighting style and is a master of multiple martial arts. Years of practice with his near-indestructible shield make him able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy. His skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or even cause a [[boomerang]]-like return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind. In canon, he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best [[hand-to-hand combat]]ants in the Marvel Universe, limited only by his human physique.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mike Carlin|Carlin, Mike]]|penciller= Neary,, Paul|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= And Other Strangers|title= Captain America|issue= 302|date= February 1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Bulanadi, Danny|story= The Devil You Know|title= Captain America|issue= 375|date= Late August 1990}}</ref> Although the super-soldier serum is an important part of his strength, Rogers has shown himself still sufficiently capable against stronger opponents, even when the serum has been deactivated reverting him to his pre-Captain America physique.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= [[Dale Eaglesham|Eaglesham, Dale]]|inker= Eaglesham, Dale|story= For a lot of my childhood&nbsp; ... |title= Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier|issue= 3|date= November 2010}}</ref>

Rogers has vast [[U.S. military]] knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing, classified Defense Department operations. He is an expert in combat strategy, survival, acrobatics, [[parkour]], military strategy, piloting, and demolitions. Despite his high profile as one of the world's most popular and recognizable superheroes, Rogers has a broad understanding of the espionage community, largely through his ongoing relationship with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]

===Super-Soldier Serum===
The formula enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build-up of [[lactic acid|fatigue poisons]] in his muscles, giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being. This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats, including bench pressing {{convert|1200|lb|kg}} and running a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) in 73 seconds (49&nbsp;mph/78 kph, nearly twice the maximum speed achieved by the best human sprinters).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= [[Javier Pulido|Pulido, Javier]]; [[Marcos Martín|Martín, Marcos]]; [[Mike Perkins|Perkins, Mike]]|inker= Pulido, Javier; Martín, Marcos; Perkins, Mike|story= Secrets of Iron & Fire|title= Captain America 65th Anniversary Special|issue= 1|date= May 2006}}</ref> Furthermore, his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades. He is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Kurt Busiek|Busiek, Kurt]]|penciller= [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]]|inker= Pérez, George|story= Book Four: The Brave and the Bold|title= [[JLA/Avengers|Avengers/JLA]]|issue= 4|date= March 2005}}</ref> The secrets of creating a super-soldier were lost with the death of its creator, [[Dr. Abraham Erskine]].<ref name="tos origin" /> In the ensuing decades there have been numerous attempts to recreate Erskine's treatment, only to have them end in failure. Even worse, the attempts have instead often created psychopathic supervillains of which Captain America's [[Grand Director|1950s imitator]] and [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] are the most notorious examples.

===Weapons and equipment===
{{further|Captain America's shield}}[[File:Captain America's shield.svg|thumb|Captain America's shield]]
Captain America has used multiple shields throughout his history, the most prevalent of which is a nigh-indestructible disc-shaped shield made from an experimental [[alloy]] of steel and the fictional [[vibranium]].<ref name="CA303">{{cite comic| writer= [[Mike Carlin|Carlin, Mike]]|penciller= Neary, Paul|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= Double Dare|title= Captain America|issue= 303|date= March 1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Carlin, Mike|penciller= Neary, Paul|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= Undercover of the Night|title= Captain America|issue= 304|date= April 1985}}</ref> The shield was cast by American metallurgist [[Dr. Myron MacLain]], who was contracted by the U.S. government, from orders of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II.<ref name="CA303" /> This alloy was created by accident and never duplicated, although efforts to reverse-engineer it resulted in the discovery of [[adamantium]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy|penciller= [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Smith, Barry]]|inker= Shores, Syd|story= Betrayal|title= The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]|issue= 66|date= July 1969}}</ref>

Captain America often uses his shield as an offensive throwing weapon. The first instance of Captain America's trademark ricocheting shield-toss occurs in [[Stan Lee]]'s first comics writing, the two-page text story "Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge" in ''Captain America Comics'' #3 (May 1941).<ref name="AmazingMarvelUniverse" /> The legacy of the shield among other comics characters includes the time-traveling mutant superhero [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] telling Captain America that his shield still exists in one of the possible futures; Cable carries it into battle and brandishes it as a symbol.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Nicieza, Fabian|penciller= Medina, Lan|inker= Tadeo, Ed|story= Living Legends|title= [[Cable & Deadpool]]|issue= 25|date= April 2006}}</ref>

When without his trademark shield, Captain America sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]]|penciller= [[Ron Garney|Garney, Ron]]|inker= [[Bob Wiacek|Wiacek, Bob]]|story= Museum Piece|title= Captain America|volume= 3|issue= 3|date= March 1998}}</ref> or even a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Waid, Mark|penciller= [[Andy Kubert|Kubert, Andy]]|inker= Delperdang, Jesse|story= American Nightmare, Chapter One: The Bite of Madness!|title= Captain America|volume= 3|issue= 9|date= September 1998}}</ref> Rogers, having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes, carried a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm, and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= Eaglesham, Dale|inker= Eaglesham, Dale|story= In 1940, the first Professor Erskine created what became&nbsp; ... |title= Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier|issue= 4|date= December 2010}}</ref> Much like his Vibranium shield, the energy shield can be thrown, including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= McCann, Jim|penciller= Diaz, Paco; Dragotta, Nick|inker= Diaz, Paco; Dragotta, Nick|story= Off-Target!|title= Hawkeye: Blindspot|issue= 2|date= May 2011}}</ref>

Captain America's uniform is made of a fire-retardant material, and he wears a lightweight, bulletproof [[duralumin]] [[Mail (armour)|scale armor]] beneath his uniform for added protection.<ref name="stern origin"/> Originally, Rogers' mask was a separate piece of material, but an early engagement had it dislodged, thus almost exposing his identity. To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.

Captain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle, modified by the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weapons laboratory, as well as a custom-built battle van, constructed by the [[Wakanda]] Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes (red, white and blue), and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it.

==Antagonists==
{{Main|List of Captain America enemies}}
Captain America has faced numerous foes in over 70 years of published adventures. Many of his recurring foes embody ideologies contrary to the American values that Captain America is shown to strive for and believes in. Some examples of these opposing values are Nazism ([[Red Skull]], [[Baron Zemo]]), [[neo-Nazism]] ([[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]), technocratic fascism ([[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], [[Arnim Zola]]), Communism ([[Aleksander Lukin]]), anarchism ([[Flag Smasher]]) and international and domestic terrorism ([[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]]).
