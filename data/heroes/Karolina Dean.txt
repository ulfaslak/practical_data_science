'''Karolina Dean''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ær|ə|ˈ|l|iː|n|ə}} {{respell|karr|ə|LEE|nə}}), also briefly known as '''Lucy in the Sky''',<ref name="runv1#6">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian K.

(referring to [[Cloak (comics)]]</ref> is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in the series ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''. Like every member of the original Runaways, she is the daughter of evil super-powered criminals; while searching through her parents' home, Karolina inadvertently discovers that her parents were [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#M|Majesdanian]] invaders. Majesdanians are an [[Fictional extraterrestrials|alien]] race that absorbs solar energy and re-radiates it in the form of the colors of the rainbow. She is often called "Kar," “Karo,” or "K" for short, and is known for her free spirit and kind nature.

Karolina is the only extraterrestrial in the group, except for a period of time when her [[Skrull]] fiancée, [[Xavin]], becomes part of the team.<ref name="comicvine">[http://www.comicvine.com/karolina-dean/29-1943/ Karolina Dean]</ref> ''Runaways'' creator Brian K. Vaughan played a significant role in the character's subsequent development as well as artist/writer Adrian Alphona, both of whom spent most of the first volume of the series hinting that Karolina was romantically attracted to fellow member [[Nico Minoru]]. By ''Runaways'''s fourth relaunch, Karolina's storyline picks up with her relationship with [[Julie Power|Lightspeed]] of [[Power Pack]] referenced in ''[[Avengers Academy]]''.

Karolina Dean is portrayed by [[Virginia Gardner]] in the [[Hulu]] television series ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'' which is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. This version of the character is half human and half alien.

==Fictional character biography==
===The Pride===
Karolina is the daughter of renowned [[Hollywood]] actors Frank and Leslie Dean and is the only older Runaway who didn't witness [[Pride (comics)|their parents]] murder an innocent girl as a sacrifice.  Karolina denies the entire situation primarily, but finally believes the group soon after discovering she is an alien.<ref name="Vol1#1">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #1</ref> The kids decide to go for a massive ransack, and leave home; before leaving for good, they decide to put their parents to justice by collecting certain evidence from their homes. When arriving at the Dean mansion, they find Karolina's parent's last will and testament; Karolina is given a piece of paper with the circular "[[no symbol]]" covering [[Caduceus|the Caduceus]]. Alex convinces her to remove her [[medic alert bracelet]] because it is emblazoned with the symbol. Karolina angrily concedes, thinking that she only wears the bracelet because she's allergic to penicillin, and her skin immediately glows with a fluid, rainbow-like light.<ref name="Vol1#3">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #3</ref> Remembering something they heard from the Pride's sacrifice, the group assumes Karolina is an alien and the bracelet is an anchor to hide her powers; Leslie Dean later confirms these theories for Karolina.<ref name="Vol1#6">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #6</ref> After escaping their parents, Karolina takes the name Lucy in the Sky, a reference to the song "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]".<ref name="Vol1#6"/>

Karolina expresses more comfort with being an extraterrestrial<ref name="Vol2#1">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #1</ref> and makes strong hints at being a lesbian, especially as she stops to compliment [[Julie Power]] on her beauty during a battle with [[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]] over the custody of [[Victor Mancha]]<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #3</ref> and later even agrees to go on a date with her following a joint [[Avengers Academy]]/Runaways mission<ref>Avengers Academy #28</ref> (and would eventually become romantically involved).<ref>Avengers Academy #39</ref> Soon after Victor joins the team, Karolina "comes out" to Nico with an attempted kiss, which Nico rejects outright.<ref name="Vol2#7">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #7</ref> Karolina's "outcast" insecurities resurface when her [[Skrull]] fiancée [[Xavin]] comes to Earth in search for her.

In ''S.W.O.R.D.'' #2, Karolina is one of the aliens kidnapped by [[Henry Peter Gyrich|Henry Gyrich]] in his "aliens go home" policy.<ref name="S.W.O.R.D. #2">''S.W.O.R.D.'' #2</ref> He uses pheromones to target Karolina's Majesdanian physiology and leads her away from the Runaways and kidnaps her without difficulty.<ref name="S.W.O.R.D. #2"/> She was eventually freed along with the other aliens.

===Reunion===
After the Runaways disbanded for some time, Karolina has moved on to a happy new life in college and left behind her anxieties over her old life with the help of therapy; thus, declined the invitation to reunite even with the return of undead Gert. Karolina reasoned she had grown up and changed from their time as scared kids on the run. She also felt it didn't make sense for them to get back together because they were never a team, like the Avengers, or had a mission, other than staying alive and not becoming their parents. Nico agreed with Karolina's assessment, but it still left her riddled with guilt.<ref name="vol5#3">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  [[Kris Anka]] | Colorist = [[Matt Wilson (comics artist)|Matt Wilson]] | Story = Finding Your Way Home | Title = Runaways | Volume = 5 | Issue = 3 | Date = November 8, 2017 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Karolina dropped by Nico's apartment to reconsider the reunion when Nico attempted to kiss Karolina but is rejected due to having a girlfriend and dismissed it as Nico's habit of seeking comfort at times of stress.<ref name="vol5#5">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  [[Kris Anka]] | Colorist = [[Matt Wilson (comics artist)|Matt Wilson]] | Story = Finding Your Way Home | Title = Runaways | Volume = 5 | Issue = 5 | Date = January 10, 2018 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> The Runaways banded together to rescue Gert and Molly from Molly's mad scientist grandmother's house. Karolina avoided hurting Molly's grandmother and her genetically engineered creations; however, once Nico was struck by a telepathic attack, Karolina blasted the house and put an end to it. Battered but finding solace together as a makeshift family, they all decided to go home.<ref name="vol5#6">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  [[Kris Anka]] | Colorist = [[Matt Wilson (comics artist)|Matt Wilson]] | Story = Finding Your Way Home | Title = Runaways | Volume = 5 | Issue = 6 | Date = February 7, 2018 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

==Relationships==
[[Image:Karolina Dean Runaways vol. 2.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Karolina in her true Majesdanian form.<ref name="Vol2#16"/> Art by [[Adrian Alphona]]]]
Karolina gets along well with the other Runaways, and the only time she had ever got into an argument with them was after they questioned her about Xavin's gender.<ref name="Vol2#23">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #23</ref> She has an older-sister type relationship with Molly, but a caring relationship with both Chase and Victor, whom she had both comforted after they lost loved ones.<ref>Chase had lost Gert, and Victor had lost Lillie</ref>

===Nico Minoru===
It was subtly hinted throughout the first volume of ''Runaways'' that Karolina had harbored a longtime crush on Nico. Much later, Karolina attempted to kiss Nico, but was rejected. Karolina then came out to Nico as a [[lesbian]], admitting her feelings for Nico.<ref name="Vol2#7"/> After deciding to leave Earth to marry Xavin, Karolina left her medical alert bracelet with Nico as a token of remembrance. When Karolina later returned to Earth, she accidentally confessed to Xavin (who had taken on the form of Nico) that she was still in love with Nico. Despite this, Karolina remained staunch in her devotion to Xavin, and thus her feelings for and attraction to Nico occasionally put a strain on their friendship.<ref name="Vol2#30"/>

When the Runaways re-banded some time later, Nico made possible romantic overtures towards Karolina, ultimately attempting to kiss her. However, Karolina rejected Nico out of faithfulness to Julie and dismissed it as Nico's habit of seeking comfort in times of stress.<ref name="vol5#5"/> Following Julie and Karolina's break-up, Karolina invited Nico to attend her parents’ legitimate foundation's a charity ball with her. While there, Karolina's usual nervousness was replaced by newfound confidence because of Nico's support as she's felt Nico had “always seen the real” her.<ref name="vol5#12"/> Nico confessed she was confused about herself for so long she couldn't see her clearly. Nico knows who and what she wants now and asks Karolina for a second chance.<ref name="vol5#12"/> Karolina was surprised and scared, which exacerbated her old feelings of rejection when Nico pulled away.<ref name="KissScript"/> But Nico seized her chance and the two kissed, beginning a relationship.<ref name="vol5#12"/>

===Xavin===
Xavin came to Earth to marry Karolina, revealing that their parents had arranged a marriage between the two of them in order to keep Earth safe from Skrull attacks. Karolina initially rejected Xavin; Xavin attempted to persuade her, explaining that the marriage would be part of a peace treaty. Karolina still refused, stating that it would be a "lie" for her to marry a man. Xavin then revealed that Skrulls had the ability to shapeshift into different genders, prompting Karolina to decide to accept the marriage proposal.<ref name="Vol2#8"/> However, they were later unable to get married when war broke out again between the Skrulls and Majesdanians. They escaped to Earth and re-joined the Runaways.<ref name="v2#17">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian K. Vaughan]] | Penciller =  [[Adrian Alphona]] | Inker = | Story = Parental Guidance | Title = Runaways | Volume = 2 | Issue = 17 | Date = June 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Throughout their relationship, Karolina apparently fully accepted Xavin's continued changing between male and female appearances. However, she secretly expressed confusion and doubts over Xavin's true gender. However, during an argument, Xavin subconsciously reverted to female human form, which pleased Karolina.<ref name="Vol2#30"/> Their relationship ended when Xavin left Earth with a remaining group of Majesdanians, sacrificing themself for Karolina.<ref name="runv3#6">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Terry Moore (cartoonist)|Terry Moore]] | Penciller =  [[Humberto Ramos]] | Inker =  | Story = Dead Wrong | Title = Runaways | Volume = 3 | Issue = 6 | Date = January 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

===Julie Power===
Karolina flirted with and later began dating [[Julie Power]], after a trip to Avengers Academy; this resulted in long-term relationship. Julie attempted to convince Karolina to move to New York so they could be together full-time after the past year apart, though Karolina was resistant to this.<ref name="vol5#7"/> After visiting Karolina in Los Angeles, Julie broke up with her, believing that she and Karolina were too incompatible and that Karolina's first priority would always be to the Runaways.<ref name="vol5#8"/>

==Powers and abilities==
Like all Majesdanians, Karolina's natural form is luminous, iridescent, and visually fluid, often depicted with waves of rainbow-like light floating off her body (Chase described her as "a burning painting") though body structure is essentially humanoid.<ref name="Vol1#3"/> Originally, Karolina required a custom made [[medic alert bracelet]] constructed of an unspecified alien metal to revert to humanoid form. However, after spending many months on Majesdane, Karolina learned to control the change and can make it at will.<ref name="Vol2#16"/> In her Majesdanian form, Karolina is able to manipulate solar energy absorbed by her body to generate large concussive blasts, fine [[laser]]-like beams and force fields capable of stopping cave-ins, gunfire and explosions. Like her parents, Karolina learned the ability to bind people, binding a New Pride in a colorful sphere. Karolina's Majesdanian form also grants her the ability to fly. During an encounter with the vampire Topher, it is revealed that Karolina's blood also harbors [[solar energy]]-based properties, because drinking her blood caused Topher to combust.

The drawback to Karolina's powers is that they have a finite charge. If she is in her Majesdanian form too long or exerts her powers too much, her glow will start to fade and revert her to human form until she uses the sun's rays to recharge. The only time she entirely lost her powers was when the Runaways battled the Gibborim to prevent Chase from sacrificing himself.<ref name="Vol2#23"/> Leslie Dean stated early in the series that Majesdanians' abilities do not affect one another.<ref name="Vol1#18"/>

==Conceptual changes==
In Brian K. Vaughan's original pitch for the series, Karolina Dean was originally called Leslie. This name would eventually be given to [[Leslie Dean|the character's mother]]. Her parents were originally real estate agents, rather than famous actors.<ref name="hardcover">{{cite book|last=K. Vaughan|first=Brian|author2=Adrian Alphona|others=Takeshi Miyazawa|title=Runaways, Vol. 1 HC|publisher=Marvel|date=2005-08-10|series=Runaways|volume=1|pages=448|isbn=0-7851-1876-4 |url=http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=2378|accessdate=2008-11-04}}</ref>
Karolina's Majesdanian form has been colored in two distinct styles.  Brian Reber, the first colorist of ''Runaways'', colored Karolina with many different colors of the [[visible spectrum]] from panel to panel.  [[Christina Strain]], the second colorist for ''Runaways'', colors Karolina in lighter tones, using primarily blue, yellow, and pink with a glitter-like effect.<ref>Pages</ref>

==Other versions==

===House of M===
Karolina Dean is mentioned as being a "go-to" girl for the [[Wolfpack (Marvel Comics)|Wolfpack]].<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #4</ref>  However, this is a ploy to capture the Wolfpack.  It is mentioned, however, that the Pride rule Southern California.

===Marvel Zombies Halloween===
A zombie Karolina Dean is attacking Kitty Pryde and her son Peter in ''Marvel Zombies Halloween''. She is stopped by Mephisto.
