==Fictional character biography==
Jennifer was born into the Kale family of sorcerers in the Florida [[Everglades]]. Attuned to mystical forces since birth, she began studying her family's history of magic. Jennifer became an apprentice of [[Dakimh the Enchanter]] and the two of them acted as allies of the [[Man-Thing]], a creature that protected a Nexus of All Realities centered in the Everglades.

Jennifer has been advised by her grandfather Joshua (even after his death), who had been a mystical Cult leader when alive.  His spirit continued this after she left her training with Dakimh and attempted to live a normal life as a college student. Regardless of her efforts at normalcy for many years she has been drawn into numerous magical conflicts. Examples include her kidnapping by [[Baron Mordo]],<ref>''Doctor Strange'' (vol. 2) #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> discovering a familial connection to the [[Ghost Rider]]<ref>''Devil's Reign'' (1997 Marvel, Top Cow) (Jan. 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref> and an adventure assisting the mutant team known [[X-Force]].<ref>''X-Force'' #85 (Jan. 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref> among others.

===Witches===
The demon [[Marduk Kurios]], one of many to use the alias "Satan", duped Jennifer's brother Andrew into touching the ''Tome of Zhered-Na''. Hereby they unleashed the curse of the Hellphyr which threatened to destroy all magical beings on Earth. Jennifer was recruited by [[Doctor Strange]], alongside some other magical heroes to oppose this plot. During the battle, Jennifer was forced to slay her Hellphyr-possessed brother. After the battle, Jennifer refused to surrender her familial Tome to Doctor Strange, who had lied to her about his true intentions of possessing the Tome for himself. Instead Jennifer decided to remain with fellow magicians [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] and [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]]. Together, they formed the group known as the [[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]], hoping to keep the world safe from mystical threats and stop would-be thieves from stealing her family book.<ref>''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]''.

===Marvel Zombies 3===
{{Main|Marvel Zombies 3}}
Kale appears with [[Wundarr the Aquarian]] and [[Siege (John Kelly)|Siege]] as a member of Florida's [[Fifty State Initiative]] team, "The Command", which is sent to Citrusville (home of [[Man-Thing]]) to investigate strange sightings. There they are attacked by zombies who have been transported from the Marvel Zombies universe to [[Earth-616]]. They are then attacked by zombie [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], who uses throwing knives to sever the tendons in her arm to prevent her from casting spells. Wundarr throws Deadpool into the blades of a nearby skiff and Kale activates them, reducing most of Deadpool's body to a bloody pulp. Siege, who has been turned into a zombie, attacks Kale and breaks her ankle before his cybernetic parts take over and shoot his head off.  She is later shown quarantined at A.R.M.O.R. headquarters, apparently shellshocked.<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #1</ref> She sits in her room, paralyzed with fear, as zombies began to infect the A.R.M.O.R. personnel and take over the base.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #3.

===The Initiative===
Jennifer is later shown defending Florida during the [[Skrull]] invasion, her body and mind sufficiently healed for her to engage magic in combat against a Skrull in Florida.<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Marvel Zombies 4===
{{Main|Marvel Zombies 4}}
Jennifer appears as part of the new [[Midnight Sons]] team, killing zombie Men-Fish and fighting their leader, [[Piranha (comics)|Piranha]].

Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Dark Reign===
{{Main|Dark Reign (comics)}}
Because Strange had abused his position as [[Sorcerer Supreme]], he had to seek out a successor, searching all over Earth in hopes of finding one. As he tells to Wiccan (who lacked knowledge of both Kale and the Man-Thing), he managed to track down Jennifer, though for some reason he had great difficulty in doing so, but determined that she was not the one, despite his belief that she would have been suitable due to her high ability.<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #51. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Heroic Age===
Jennifer tried to stop the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] from using Man-Thing as their transportation, recalling him to the swamp to fight off an invasion from the Nexus of All Realities.  Eventually, she realized that Man-Thing was willingly working with the Thunderbolts, and that she would simply need to alert him any time someone broke through.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 1 #154 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jennifer is apparently killed by [[Victoria Hand]] who is at the time possessed by [[Daniel Drumm]].<ref>''New Avengers'' v2 #31</ref> Drumm wanted to eliminate all users of dark magic before enacting his revenge on Doctor Strange and the New Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' v2 #34. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jennifer uses dark magic to return to life, but at the cost of having no skin on the right side of her face. Her resurrection is kept mostly secret from the world, but [[Maria Hill]] recruits her to support [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] against [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and [[the Hand (comics)|the Hand]].<ref>''Elektra'' Vol.3 #9 (2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Kale was found on Weirdworld, during an incident that destroyed the normal flow of time. A common occurrence on Weirdworld. She had a romance with Deadpool that lasted for years. Deadpool threw this away to kill a target that was hiding on Weirdworld.<ref>''Deadpool'' Volume 5 #4 (2018). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Though initially only a novice in the mystic arts of the [[Marvel Universe]], Jennifer Kale held tremendous potential for wielding magic and has since honed it through many years of intensive training and tutelage. Though her training was based upon the brand of magic wielded by Zhered-Na, she has since been tutored by other sorcerers and she is also self-taught to a degree. As of now, Kale can fire magical bolts, form shields, open dimensional portals, mesmerize people, affect the memories of others, teleport herself and others, and cast numerous spells for a variety of effects.

''The Tome of Zhered-Na'' is named after the antediluvian sorceress who foretold the end of Atlantis, and the Tome allegedly possessed all the mysticism known to man and demonkind at the time of its creation. For speaking this truth, Zhered-Na was banished and set adrift upon the sea. While she floated, her god, Valka, whispered secrets to her about the world and the world of the future. After many weeks she landed at Thuria and founded the Cult of Zhered-Na. She lived and taught there until she was slain by the demon D'Spayre. Atlantis met its fate that same day. Two spirits rescued the wisdom of Zhered-Na and decades later gave it to Illyana Kale, the descendant of a cult member. Kale was inspired then to write the Tome. Certain deities felt that too many secrets were contained inside the Book, so they placed the demon Hellphyr inside its pages to ward away unwelcome users. When the Book was recently opened and Hellphyr was released, Illyana's descendant Jennifer Kale joined with fellow witches Topaz and Satana to stop the demon and save the Tome. The Tome of Zhered-Na is currently with Jennifer Kale. Though presumably less powerful than the [[Darkhold]] or the [[Book of the Vishanti]], it is nonetheless powerful enough to strike awe into the [[Sorcerer Supreme]] [[Doctor Strange]] and was sealed so only a member of the Kale lineage could access it, and only then assisted by a representative of divinity and a representative of the Underworld.

==Sexuality==
Jennifer had a boyfriend named Bernard Drabble during her time in the [[Legion of Night]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} was shown with a boyfriend named Jaxon (surname unrevealed),<ref>''Fear'' #13, 18; ''Man-Thing'' vol. 2 #4</ref> and was shown romancing a boy named Chris in ''Over the Edge'' #2.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In ''Ghost Rider'' volume 2, her cousin{{Original research inline|date=December 2016}} [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Danny Ketch]] has a vision of a life where their family never was involved in magic. In this scenario he envisions Jennifer as having a girlfriend of three years named Marie.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #92. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later during her encounter with Satana, the latter suggests that Jennifer is not interested in boys and makes a snide comment about Jennifer staring at her chest.<ref>''Witches'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Jennifer was recognized as [[bisexual]] in the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Mystic Arcana - The Book of Marvel Magic'' (2007) in the entry for ''Witches''. In ''Marvel Zombies 4'', Jennifer Kale quotes Topaz as having called her "girlfriend" in an ironic sense.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>
