'''Thunderbird''' ('''John Proudstar''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], the character first appears in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 ([[cover-dated]] May 1975). Thunderbird was a short-lived member of the Second Genesis group of [[X-Men]] gathered together in this issue, as he died on their second mission.

An [[Apache]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Human Mutant]], John Proudstar possesses superhuman athletic ability. Since his death, the character has been temporarily brought back to life in the [[Necrosha]] and [[Chaos War]] storylines. His brother, [[Warpath (comics)|James Proudstar]], known first as Thunderbird, and then as Warpath, is also a mutant and X-Men with similar capabilities.

In addition to his [[Marvel Universe|mainstream]] incarnations, Thunderbird has been depicted in other [[fictional universes]]. The most notable alternative version of the character is the member of the original [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] team. In other media, Thunderbird is one of the main characters adapted to the [[Live action|live-action]] television series ''[[The Gifted (U.S. TV series)|The Gifted]]'', which debuted in 2017, portrayed by the actor [[Blair Redford]].

==Publication history==
Writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]] created Thunderbird for the new [[X-Men]], specifically to be a member of the team who would fail the entrance exam. Having already decided that the previously introduced characters [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] would fail the exam, Wein and Cockrum felt it would be unrealistic for only older characters to "flunk out", and set about creating a new character to fit this role. After developing Thunderbird, however, they decided that they liked the character — his costume in particular — too much to write him off after only one issue, and decided to keep him on.<ref name="TyphoonDave">{{cite news | last = Meth | first= Clifford | date = August 1993 | title = How a Typhoon Blew in Success | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty'' | issue = | pages = 50–52}}</ref>

The character debuted in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May 1975). While working on the first issues of the regular series, the creative team realized that having Thunderbird as a regular character was problematic. According to Cockrum, "...we created him as an obnoxious loudmouth, and we already had an obnoxious loudmouth in [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. So one of us decided to kill him off after all, just for shock value."<ref name="TyphoonDave"/> [[Chris Claremont]], who scripted the story, confirms that it was Wein who decided to kill the character, and added, "He figured there are two ways to do this. One, you spend years, if not decades, building up a relationship between the audience and a character, building the emotional bonds between them so when something happens to that character the audience is devastated. Or you do it right off the bat, when no one is expecting it."<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Christensen | first1= William | last2 = Seifert | first2 = Mark | date = August 1993 | title = From Gofer to Comic Great | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty'' | issue = | pages = 36–40}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Dave |last1=Richards |url=http://www.cbr.com/claremont-celebrates-the-past-with-x-men-gold/ |title=Claremont Celebrates the Past with "X-Men: Gold" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |website=cbr.com |date=November 20, 2013 |accessdate=May 13, 2017}}</ref> The story culminating in Thunderbird's death appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' #94-95.<ref>{{cite web|author=CBR Staff |url=http://www.cbr.com/taking-an-early-look-at-giant-size-x-men-4/ |title=Taking An Early Look at "Giant-Size X-Men" #4 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |website=cbr.com |date=June 9, 2005 |accessdate=May 13, 2017}}</ref>

In 2000, for the 25th anniversary of the introduction of Thunderbird, writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and artist [[Aaron Lopresti]] did a two-issue series about the character, with a cover by [[Art Adams]]. Marvel Comics never published the series. At the same period, after nine years of absence, Chris Claremont returned to the X-Men to take over the titles. According to [[Brian Cronin]] from [[Comic Book Resources]], there were likely two events that lead to the cancellation of this mini-series. Firstly, Claremont introduced a new X-Man character [[Thunderbird (Neal Shaara)|Neal Shaara]] with the codename Thunderbird. Secondly, Claremont had his own project for the 25th anniversary: ''X-Men: Black Sun'', which had a spotlight comic on the various members of the All-New, All-Different X-Men, including one on Thunderbird with his partner Wolverine.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Cronin |last1=Brian |authorlink1=Brian Cronin |url=https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-legends-revealed-472/3/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #472 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |website=cbr.com |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
John Proudstar was born into an [[Apache tribe]] on a reservation in [[Camp Verde]], [[Arizona]]. As a teenager, he discovered he possessed the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] abilities of superhuman senses, strength, speed, stamina, and sturdiness.<ref name="Green">{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Paul|title=Encyclopedia of Weird Westerns: Supernatural and Science Fiction Elements in Novels, Pulps, Comics, Films, Television and Games|date=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786458004|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HDnHo993Dv0C&pg=PA206#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=May 13, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Proudstar was [[conscription|drafted]] into the [[United States Marine Corps]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and earned the rank of corporal. He returned to his tribe after the war, but he was unhappy and listless.

===X-Men===
He was then recruited by [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] to join his third group of X-Men.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rhoades|first1=Shirrel|title=Comic Books: How the Industry Works|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=9780820488929|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn4qwJ7LdMUC&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=May 13, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Eager to prove his prowess, Proudstar agreed and assumed the superhero codename '''Thunderbird'''.

During the weeks of training that followed, the ill-tempered and individualistic Thunderbird often found himself going head to head with the X-Men's leader, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]. The new team's second mission took them to Valhalla Base, Colorado, to combat [[Count Nefaria]] and the [[Ani-Men]].<ref group=C>[[Chris Claremont]] (w), [[Dave Cockrum]] (p), [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]] (i), "The Doomsmith Scenario!", [[Uncanny X-Men 94|''Uncanny X-Men#94'']] (August, 1975)</ref><ref name=Cornell>{{Cite web |url=http://jsaw.lib.lehigh.edu/viewarticle.php?id=99&layout=html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304225043/http://jsaw.lib.lehigh.edu/viewarticle.php?id=99&layout=html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-04 |first1=Mike |last1=Cornnell |date=2004 |title=Glossary of Characters: Thunderbird |publisher=Lehigh Student Award Winners (L-SAW) |website=jsaw.lib.lehigh.edu |access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref> When Nefaria attempted to make his escape in a jet plane, Proudstar leapt on board.

Thunderbird's brother, [[Warpath (comics)|James Proudstar]] has similar powers, although to a much greater degree. He is also an X-Man who first used the codename Thunderbird then switched to [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] when he joined [[X-Force]] team.<ref name="Green"/>{{rp|220}}<ref>{{cite web|author=Meagan Damore |url=https://www.cbr.com/the-gifted-thunderbird-warpath-team-up/ |title=The Gifted: Redford Wants Thunderbird to Team Up With Warpath |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |website=cbr.com |date=October 23, 2017 |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}</ref>

===Chaos War===
During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Thunderbird is among the fallen X-Men members (along with [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Moira MacTaggert]], Esme and Sophie of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], and three deceased dupes of [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]]) to return from the dead after what happened to the death realms. He remembers the last time he was revived briefly during the events of Necrosha, albeit faintly. Thunderbird leads the revived X-Men members to looking for a diary written by [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] that might hold the key to defeating [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] while evading Carrion Crow, Eater of the Dead.<ref group=C>[[Louise Simonson]] (w), [[Chris Claremont]] (w), [[Doug Braithwaite]] (p, i), "Dead X-Men" (Part 1), ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War: X-Men]]'' #1 (February, 2011)</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Doug Zawisza |url=http://www.cbr.com/chaos-war-x-men-1/ |title=Chaos War: X-Men #1 - Comic Book Review |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |website=cbr.com |date=December 29, 2010 |accessdate=May 13, 2017}}</ref> Thunderbird called upon the mythical Thunderbird to get him and his group away from the Carrion Crow.

==Powers and abilities==
Thunderbird was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possessed superhuman strength (sufficient to rip apart a [[fighter jet]] with his bare hands), speed (he was fast enough to outrun a [[bison]], possibly much faster), and stamina due to his dense musculature.<ref name="Green"/> His senses were also enhanced, enabling him to become a highly adept [[Tracking (hunting)|tracker]].

Thunderbird had military training in hand-to-hand combat.

==Analysis==
In ''Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study,'' Michael A. Sheyahshe compared John Proudstar to [[Tupac Shakur]], noting that "Thunderbird becomes even more popular, posthumously, than he ever was while living."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sheyahshe |first1=Michael A. |title=Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study |date=2008 |publisher=McFarland & Co. |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |pages=12–13 |isbn=9780786435654}}</ref>

In September 2001, Bill Rosemann, the marketing communications manager of Marvel Comics, announced that "The death of Thunderbird!", ''Uncanny X-Men'' #95 had been classed number 32 in the 100 best Marvel Comics.<ref>{{cite web|author=CBR Staff |url=http://www.cbr.com/100-greatest-marvels-the-countdown/ |title=100 Greatest Marvels: The Countdown |publisher=CBR |date=2001-09-20 |accessdate=2017-05-13}}</ref>

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] universe, John Proudstar is at the head of a religious group Ghost Dance whose members perform nightly dances asking the ancient spirits to bring an end to Apocalypse's reign. They also provided safe passage to Avalon through the Infernal Gallop. When [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] had the mission to travel to Avalon and bring back the mutant known as Destiny, he forced Proudstar to provide them passage.<ref group=C>[[Warren Ellis]] (w), Ken Lashley (p), Phil Moy (i), Bud LaRosa (i), Tom Wegrzyn (i), "The Infernal Gallop", ''[[X-Calibre]]'' #1 (March, 1995)</ref> Betrayed by [[Danielle Moonstar]], the Madri learned of  Proudstar and the Infernal Gallop's location at Ghost Dance.

===Earth X===
In the [[Earth X]] reality, John Proudstar's life is very similar.<ref group=C>[[Jim Krueger]] (s), [[Alex Ross]] (s), John Paul Leon (p), Bill Reinhold (i), ''[[Earth X]]'' #6 (September, 1999)</ref> Thunderbird is seen in the Realm of the Dead talking with Professor X both believing they are still alive.<ref group=C>[[Jim Krueger]] (s), [[Alex Ross]] (s), John Paul Leon (p, i), Bill Reinhold (i), ''[[Earth X]]'' #7 (October, 1999)</ref>

===Exiles===
An alternate version of John Proudstar is an original member of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], a group of superhumans tasked with fixing damaged realities. This Thunderbird is captured by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] during his time with the X-Men and unwillingly transformed into one of his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]], namely [[War (Marvel Comics)|War]].<ref group=C>[[Judd Winick]] (w), [[Mike McKone]] (p), Mark McKenna (i), "Down The Rabbit Hole", ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #1 (August, 2001)</ref>

Thunderbird's time with this group is relatively short, several months at most. He serves mainly as the powerhouse of the group. In the third story arc, he meets another alternate version of himself, who has become the [[Shaman (comics)|shaman]] of [[Alpha Flight]], and this arc is largely centered on his internal conflicts.<ref group=C>''Exiles'' #5-6</ref> Later, Thunderbird sacrifices himself to hold an anti-matter bomb within the body of [[Galactus]], which forces the world-devourer to leave Earth after the massive injury the bomb causes. Although his physical body heals from the damage caused by the detonation, he is left in a coma. He is replaced by [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Sasquatch]] and the team are forced to leave him behind.<ref name="Exiles10" group=C>''Exiles'' #10</ref><ref name="Wiener">{{cite book|last1=Wiener|first1=Robert G.|title=Marvel Graphic Novels and Related Publications: An Annotated Guide to Comics, Prose Novels, Children’s Books, Articles, Criticism and Reference Works, 1965–2005|date=2008|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786451159|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npIsZV7grboC&pg=PA129#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=13 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> His body is later discovered in the Panoptichron, a crystal city that lies between realities, but has yet to be returned to his home reality.<ref group=C>''Exiles'' #62</ref>

During his time with the Exiles, he develops a romantic relationship with teammate [[Nocturne (Talia Wagner)|Nocturne]],<ref group=C>''Exiles'' #1-10</ref> who is pregnant with his child when he becomes comatose.<ref name="Exiles10" group=C/><ref name="Wiener"/> (However, she later loses the child for unexplained reasons.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}) Issue #16 shows flashbacks of previously unseen scenes between the two characters that further develop their relationship.<ref name="Exiles 16" group=C>''Exiles'' #16</ref>

This version of Thunderbird is considerably more powerful than the mainstream one, due to Apocalypse's augmentations. His skin is covered by retractable armor plates that harden when he enters battle, considerably increasing his durability, and even at the base level, his power statistics are above his main continuity counterpart. His power increases with his rage, akin to the [[Hulk]] who he once defeated in close combat, and his appearance becomes more bestial as he does so.<ref name="Exiles 6" group=C>''Exiles'' #6</ref>

A side-effect of Apocalypse's modifications is that Thunderbird no longer has a sense of taste.<ref name="Exiles 6" group=C/> He nevertheless enjoys smelling things.<ref name="Exiles 16" group=C/>

===Bust===
In 2003, Dynamic Forces created a bust of Thunderbird. Nick Barrucci, president of Dynamic Forces, said "The X-Men have such a rich, yet tragic history. To commemorate, DF worked to create two busts presenting the heroes of the X-Men who gave the ultimate sacrifice — their lives. So, we are starting our 'Memorial' Diorama line with two of the biggest heroes - Colossus and Thunderbird!"<ref>{{cite web|author=CBR Staff |url=http://www.cbr.com/colossus-and-thunderbird-immortalized-by-dynamic-forces/ |title='Colossus' and 'Thunderbird' immortalized by Dynamic Forces |publisher=CBR |date=July 30, 2003 |accessdate=May 13, 2017}}</ref>
