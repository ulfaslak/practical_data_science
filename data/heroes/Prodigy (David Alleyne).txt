'''Prodigy''' ('''David Alleyne''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Prodigy is a student at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], member of the [[New X-Men]] squad, and a former [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who lost his superhuman abilities.

==Publication history==
Created by writers [[Nunzio DeFilippis]] and [[Christina Weir]] and artist [[Keron Grant]], David Alleyne first appeared in ''[[New Mutants#The New Mutants, vol. 2|New Mutants]]'', vol. 2 #4 (October 2003). He was originally a mutant with the ability to absorb the knowledge and skills of anyone within a limited distance. He could not control this ability and would forget his acquired knowledge once they became out of range. He attends the Xavier Institute and becomes co-leader of the New Mutants training squad. After the events of ''[[House of M]]'' and the ensuing "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" of mutants, David loses his powers, but he remains at the Institute, becoming a member of the [[New X-Men]] team and utilizing his natural intellect to assist his teammates. He later regains all the knowledge and skills he had absorbed before becoming depowered, including many of the X-Men's considerable expertise in science and physical combat, making him a stronger addition to the X-Men. Despite being human, he remains with the X-Men as a substitute instructor and trainee for stories over a number of years.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life and moving to the Xavier Institute===
David Alleyne is a naturally intelligent boy, who finds upon becoming a teenager that the answers to his exams and assignments begin appearing in his head whenever he is in the same room as his teachers. He realizes that he is a mutant with the ability to know anything that the people nearby know. Wanting to retain this knowledge, David becomes driven to study even harder. He takes college-level courses while finishing high school and drops subtle hints to his family about his powers, but they fail to realize he is a mutant until the campus anti-mutant group outs him. Realizing he can no longer be a mutant in secrecy, David accepts an invitation from [[Danielle Moonstar]] to attend the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]]. His parents and sister are supportive of his decision.<ref name="debut"/>

At the school he befriends [[Wind Dancer]], [[Wallflower (comics)|Wallflower]] and [[Wither (comics)|Wither]].<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #5 (November 2003)</ref> They are attacked by [[Reavers (comics)|the Reavers]], and afterwards Dani makes David roommates with one of these Reavers, [[Elixir (comics)|Josh Foley]].<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #6 (December 2003)</ref> The tactic works, and David soon comes to regard Josh as a little brother.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #7-9, 12</ref> Along with his other friends at the school, they bring to Xavier Institute the homeless mutant [[Surge (comics)|Surge]], who David acquires an immediate interest in.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #9-10, ''New X-Men: Academy X'' #1</ref>

David, Josh, Surge, Wind Dancer, Wallflower, and Wither are placed on Dani's squad of students, called "the New Mutants," and David is given the codename Prodigy.<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #2 (August 2004)</ref> Not liking the idea that he is being groomed to be an X-Man, David declines to be the team leader, leaving the position to Wind Dancer. However, she quickly loses faith in her ability to lead. They compromise by becoming team co-leaders.<ref>{{cite book |title=New X-Men - Academy X Vol. 1: Choosing Sides|first= Nunzio |last=DeFilippis |author2=Christina Weir  |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=0-7851-1538-2 |year=2004}}</ref> Prodigy later learns that his mental blocks can be removed, allowing him to permanently retain the knowledge he absorbs, but he first experiences a telepathic illusion created by Dani and [[Emma Frost]] of a possible future based from that decision. In it, David excels by gaining the knowledge of the most important and intellectual individuals in the world, bringing a near-[[utopia]] to the globe, through genocide and the killing of his friends and the X-Men. The illusion ends with Surge, his wife, overloading her powers, killing them both in order to stop him. On seeing the illusion, he rejects having his mental blocks removed and begins to avoid Surge.<ref name=NXMACDX2>{{cite book |title=New X-Men - Academy X Vol. 2: Haunting|first= Nunzio |last=DeFilippis |author2=Christina Weir  |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=0-7851-1615-X |year=2005}}</ref> However, she later confronts him, stating that what he saw was only an illusion of his worst fears, and David begins a relationship with her.<ref name=NXMACDX3>{{cite book |title=New X-Men - Academy X Vol. 3: X-Posed|first= Nunzio |last=DeFilippis |author2=Christina Weir  |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=0-7851-1791-1 |year=2005}}</ref>

===Power loss and the New X-Men===
In the "Decimation" storyline following the events of ''House of M'', David is one of the many mutants who loses his powers because of the [[Scarlet Witch]]. Planning to leave the school, David reveals that he built a "Danger Cave" to replace the destroyed [[Danger Room]] before he lost his powers. The facility allows his teammates to train by reliving former X-Men missions.<ref name="NXMCHE1">{{cite book |title=New X-Men: Childhood's End Volume 1 |first=Craig |last=Kyle |author2=Christopher Yost  |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=0-7851-1831-4  |year=2006}}</ref> David's parents and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] decide that it would be safer for David to remain at the mansion since [[William Stryker]] is targeting depowered mutants as well. When Stryker attacks the mansion, David saves the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] and is wounded by one of the Purifiers.<ref name="NXMCHE2">{{cite book |title=New X-Men: Childhood's End Volume 2 |first=Craig |last=Kyle |author2=Christopher Yost  |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=0-7851-2024-6  |year=2006}}</ref>  He joins the [[New X-Men]] later when they leave to fight the mutant-hunting future Sentinel, [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]].  David proves useful to the team when he attacks the robot with the heavy artillery.  After returning to the mansion, he is invited to join his girlfriend [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] in running the New X-Men squad, giving them free rein to add more members at their will.<ref name="NXMCHE3">{{cite book |title=New X-Men: Childhood's End Volume 3 |first=Craig |last=Kyle |author2=Christopher Yost  |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=0-7851-2025-4  |year=2006}}</ref>

In the "Quest for Magik" storyline, the demon [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]] senses [[Magik (comics)|Magik]]'s returned presence due to her temporary revival during ''House of M'', but cannot locate her and fails to magically revive her (instead creating the dark, soulless form of Illyana called Darkchilde, whom he banishes in disgust). Sensing her presence on the students at the Institute due to their involvement with her in the "House of M" reality, he incapacitated the X-Men and sucks the students into [[Otherplace|Limbo]], including David, whose eyesight was healed to [[normal vision]] by Josh using his newly acquired medical expertise.  Belasco interrogates David about her whereabouts, but since none of the students remember the ''House of M'' reality, he is confused and tells her that she is still dead. Enraged, Belasco kills David by ripping out his heart. Some of the students break free and attack Belasco, while Josh manages to immediately regrow David's heart with his powers, bringing him back to life. While the students battle against Belasco, David realizes that his weakness is telepathy, having put special helmets to block the telepathic powers of Stepford Cuckoos and [[Martha Johansson]].  David directs [[X-23]] to free the Cuckoos, who launch a telepathic attack on Belasco.  Though initially successful, the Cuckoos are forced out of Belasco's mind, but he is ultimately defeated by [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] and Darkchilde.  The students are later returned to Earth by Darkchilde, when she seals off all entrances to Limbo.<ref name="QFM">{{cite book |title=New X-Men: Childhood's End Volume 5|first=Craig |last=Kyle |author2=Christopher Yost |author3=Christina Weir |author4=Nunzio DeFilippis  |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=978-0-7851-2239-5 |year=2007}}</ref>

===Regaining knowledge and skills===
Prodigy and Surge's relationship comes to an end soon after.  Learning of David's near-death experience in Limbo, Surge fears for his safety and attempts to force him to leave the school by kissing [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] in front of him.  David prepares to leave, but is confronted by the Cuckoos, who offer to remove his mental blocks as thanks for saving them during Stryker's attack, restoring all the past knowledge and skills he absorbed when he had his powers.  Though he can no longer absorb other people's knowledge, he now possesses the collective knowledge and skills of every individual he absorbed before the onset of ''Decimation'', including [[Beast (comics)|Beast's]] vast medical and technological expertise and the elite fighting skills of several of the X-Men.  Using [[Krav Maga]] martial arts picked up from [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], he displays his newfound assets by besting Hellion in combat, fully aware that the kiss had just been a ploy.  He then breaks up with Surge and is appointed as a substitute instructor by Cyclops.<ref name="QFM"/>

In the ''X-Men'' [[crossover event]] ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]'', the X-Men, the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], [[Predator X (comics)|Predator X]], as well as the anti-mutant Purifiers all race to recover the [[Hope Summers (comics)|first mutant child born since M-Day]], who was kidnapped from her hometown.  Thinking the Purifiers may have the baby, Surge leads the New X-Men in a mission against to attack the Purifiers' base and recover her.  Prodigy declines participation and stays behind at the school, viewing the mission to be largely out of vengeance against the Purifiers for their murdered schoolmates than to truly locate the baby. While the New X-Men are away on their mission, the school is attacked by O*N*E Sentinels controlled by [[Cassandra Nova]]'s nano-bots.  Prodigy assists Beast in the hospital wing stabilizing the severely injured students and faculty.  He later repairs [[Cerebro]] with the Cuckoos, who state that they find the structure of his brain fascinating.<ref name=XMNMC>{{cite book |title=X-Men: Messiah Complex|first=Ed |last=Brubaker |author2=Mike Carey |author3=Kyle Yost |author4=David Yost |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=0-7851-2899-9 |year=2008}}</ref>

===Manifest Destiny & Utopia===
After the events of ''Messiah Complex'', the X-Men disband and later reform in [[San Francisco]].  Prodigy relocates with the X-Men to assist Beast in setting up Cerebro.  He continues to work with the X-Men, though he is no longer on any active teams, instead running the new Danger Room<ref>Runaways Vol 3 # 10</ref> and assisting the X-Men during the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]]<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #1-4</ref> and the take over of San Francisco by [[Norman Osborn]] and his [[Dark X-Men]] as well as joining the rest of the mutants to the Mutant island Utopia where he assists Cyclops keeping the island maintained.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #513</ref><ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 2 #16</ref> He is later seen in the field helping out Hellion and Surge deal with the resurrected Rusty Collins.<ref>''X-Force'' #21</ref>

===Second Coming===

===Schism and Regenesis===
When a giant Sentinel attacks Utopia, Prodigy joins in the fight along with the other students to help destroy it.<ref>''Generation Hope'' #13</ref> When Wolverine decides to leave Utopia and return to Westchester to reopen the school, Prodigy is among the younger X-Men who choose to stay at Utopia.<ref>''X-Men: Regenesis''</ref>

===Young Avengers===
Bitter and disillusioned at Cyclops' manipulation, David is later seen working at a superhuman [[Call centre|call center]], where he uses his knowledge to help various people solve superhuman crises. While employed there, he meets and befriends [[Tommy Shepherd]], the former [[Young Avengers|Young Avenger]] Speed. The two work together on a stakeout to catch a thief dressed as [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]], but the plan goes awry when the criminal dissipates Tommy's body and then fades away.<ref>''Young Avengers'' (Vol. 2) #6</ref> He joins the Young Avengers to help them find Speed and while stranded in another dimension with Hulkling, he kisses him.

Prodigy is featured in the 'Original Sins' five issue limited series.

It is shown later that Prodigy auditions to be the security expert at the new Stark Industries, though he loses the job to [[Scott Lang|Ant-Man]].<ref>"Ant-Man" (Vol. 2) #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Prodigy initially has the [[telepathy|telepathic]] ability to absorb and mimic the knowledge and skills from the minds of the people in close proximity to him. A side effect of his powers are self-imposed [[mental block]]s, which prevents him from retaining the knowledge he absorbs, forgetting whatever he has learned after a short period of time.<ref name="debut">''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #4 (October 2003)</ref> The power is completely involuntary,<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #9 (February 2004)</ref><ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #2</ref> and absorbs only studied knowledge, not thoughts, short-term information, or awareness.<ref name="debut"/><ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #1</ref>

Since losing his powers, he maintains a high intellect, due to his extensive studying prior to coming to Xavier's. He creates a Danger Cave, a training room for the rest of his peers, and shows an extensive knowledge of the past missions of the X-Men.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #21</ref> When the mental blocks in his mind are removed by the Stepford Cuckoos, David later regains access to all the skills and knowledge that he absorbed when he was still a mutant. He can recall the fighting abilities and scientific knowledge of many of the X-Men including Beast's medical knowledge, Forge's and Professor Xavier's expertise in various subjects, Wolverine and Kitty Pryde's martial arts, etc.

Along with his intellect, Prodigy has displayed great competency as a leader. Both [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #10</ref> and Danielle Moonstar<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #7</ref> have acknowledged his leadership skills.

==Other versions==

===House of M===
In the [[House of M]] universe, David was once more a member of the [[New Mutants]]. The New Mutants were a group of young mutants trained to be diplomats, and David graduated the [[wiktionary:valedictorian|valedictorian]]. Prodigy once more acts as the leader of the New Mutants  (although in this case it's more unofficial). He leads the New Mutants in an attempt to save Nori's father. While initially conflicting with rival group the Hellions, the two groups would join together after learning of tortures of humans. David, along with the rest of the surviving New Mutants and the Hellions, would later make their last stand against [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and his army.<ref>{{cite book |title=House of M: New X-Men -- Academy X |first=Nunzio |last=DeFilippis | author2= Christina Weir |others=penciller: Aaron Lopresti |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=978-0-7851-1941-8 |year=2006}}</ref>

===Too Much Information===
In the ''New X-Men'' storyline "Too Much Information," David asks [[Emma Frost]] and [[Danielle Moonstar]] to remove the [[mental block]]s keeping him from retaining the knowledge he absorbs. Unknown to David at the time, it was an illusion created by Dani, which was enhanced by Emma Frost's telepathic abilities to show him what might happen if the blocks were removed.<ref name=NXMACDX2/>

In the illusion, David quickly surpasses all the teachers at the school, having permanently retained all the knowledge they possessed.  David leaves the institute, telling Josh Foley ([[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]]) that he would use Josh's healing power to heal every disease known to mankind for free.  Three months later, David has gained the knowledge of [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], [[Henry Kissinger]], and many other prominent geniuses simply by passing near them.  He announces at a press conference that he has cures for [[AIDS]], [[cancer]] and every other known disease.  He plans to distribute this cure across the entire country in a matter of weeks.  However, these cures come at a high price, as Josh dies during the medical procedure that harvested the tissue from his body needed for the cures. David mourns his friend, but firmly believes that his unwilling sacrifice was just.<ref name=NXMACDX2/>

Eighteen years later, David has married former teammate Surge, been elected President of the United States, eliminated poverty, unemployment, and discrimination against mutants and has nearly created a worldwide government. The only major holdout is China, which he plans to bomb via teleportation. Noriko secretly shares this information with the X-Men in hopes that they can prevent a mass genocide. However, before they can act on this information, David sends them on a false mission to investigate a satellite that he causes to explode, killing them. Seeking a convenient scapegoat, he declares that the already outlaw [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]] are terrorist threats and blames them for killing the X-Men. The Hellions and reformed New Mutants join forces when many of the dark secrets of David's rise to power come to light. The combined groups (Hellion, Mercury, Tag, Rockslide, Wither, Wind Dancer, Icarus, Surge, and Wallflower) stage an assault on the [[White House]], but David's security forces (XSE agents, Bishop, Storm, and Angel Salvadore) kill most of the heroes. In the end, Noriko confronts David in the [[Oval Office]], then uses her powers to destroy the White House and everyone remaining in it.<ref name=NXMACDX2/>

Though an illusion, it had a lasting effect on how he viewed his powers.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #43</ref>

===''X-Men: The End''===
Prodigy briefly appears in ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', as an agent of the [[X.S.E.]] Along with [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], he interrogates Sage. Prodigy absorbs all the information she knows, and is deeply troubled with what he finds out. When joined by [[Val Cooper]], he reveals that she is an impostor. She responds by transforming into a Warskrull, killing Prodigy shortly after.<ref name=XMNTE1>{{cite book |title=X-Men: The End Book One: Dreamers and Demons|first=Chris |last=Claremont |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=0-7851-1690-7 |year=2005}}</ref>
