== Publication history ==
Robbie Reyes first appeared in ''All-New Ghost Rider'' #1 (March [[2014 in comics|2014]]), created by writer [[Felipe Smith]] and artist Tradd Moore.

When Marvel Comics was getting retooled as [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]], editor Mark Paniccia approached writer Felipe Smith on creating a newer and younger Ghost Rider. Among Paniccia's suggestions were that this new Ghost Rider drive a car instead of a motorcycle, an idea that excited Smith.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2014/10/14/all-new-ghost-rider-felipe-smith-brings-creative-muscle-to-the-reborn-spirit-of-vengeance/|title=‘ALL-NEW GHOST RIDER’: Felipe Smith brings creative muscle to the reborn Spirit of Vengeance|website=Washington Post|access-date=September 17, 2017}}</ref> Another big difference between this Ghost Rider and its predecessors is that Reyes doesn't have a floating head, or a human skull, Smith says. "He's an amalgam of a flaming car and a human being. He's not wearing a helmet, and his head isn't a skull: this Ghost Rider is designed so his look simulates the lines of the classic muscle car he was racing the night he died."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/ghost-rider-marvel-comics-exclusive-felipe-smith-axel-alonso/|title=Exclusive: Ghost Rider Is Blazing Back to Comics|date=August 9, 2016|work=TVGuide.com|access-date=September 17, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Tradd Moore was brought in to sketch ideas based on Smith's concept.
He also, more recently, appears on Ghost Rider(2016), Marvel Legacy and Avengers (2018) #1.  <ref>{{cite web|last=Arrant |first=Chris |url=http://www.newsarama.com/20276-under-the-hood-of-the-all-new-ghost-rider-character-design.html |title=Under The Hood Of The ALL-NEW GHOST RIDER Character Design |website=Newsarama.com |date=February 10, 2014 |accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==
[[File:Four on the Floor Part Four-TV Variant.png|[[Felipe Smith]]’s TV variant cover art to ''Ghost Rider'' (2017) #4.|thumb|right|upright]]
Robbie Reyes is a high-school student working as a mechanic at an auto body shop who lives with his [[Developmental disability|developmentally disabled]] brother [[Gabe Reyes|Gabe]] and seeks to get away from the dangerous, gang-riddled streets of [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]]. To that end, he enters a street race, hoping to use the prize money to move themselves away. He is gunned down by mercenaries trying to retrieve pills that caused the transformation of [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Calvin Zabo]] into the supervillain Mr. Hyde, which had been left in the trunk of the 1969 Dodge Charger he "borrowed" from the auto body shop for the race. He is revived as a demonic being with a flaming, helmet-like head. He drives off in the car, now similarly ablaze.<ref>''All New Ghost Rider'' #1</ref>

Later, the spirit bound to the car introduces itself to Robbie as the ghost of a man named [[Eli Morrow]], who says he had been killed by gang members. Eli offers to help Robbie clean up his neighborhood in exchange for Robbie helping him avenge his death.<ref>''All-New Ghost Rider'' #2</ref> Robbie becomes a local hero whose fame catches the attention of Johnny Blaze, who travels to Los Angeles to confront the new Rider. Eli is later revealed as Robbie's estranged uncle, a Satanic serial killer who kidnapped and murdered at least 37 people in rituals before being fatally shot by police in 1999. A possessed Robbie later encounters Johnny Blaze, who uses the Penance Stare on Eli's spirit.<ref name="Eight" />

Eli was also the one who pushed Robbie's mother down the stairs while she was pregnant with Gabe, causing Gabe's disabilities.<ref>''All-New Ghost Rider'' #11</ref>

In addition to confronting Mr. Hyde and his criminal underworld, Robbie and Eli fight for dominance over Robbie's body. Robbie eventually permanently bonds with Eli and agrees to sate Eli's thirst for murder, but only by killing people with evil souls.<ref name="Twelve" />

He appears in ''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' along with [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Hawkeye]], both working to stop a ceremony being held by dwarves using a mystical space rock. [[Gwenpool]] appeared in his trunk's portal via her friend Sarah "The Terrible Eye" and the police arrived, prompting them all to flee. He had claimed the gem with Gwen's ghost friend Cecil inside and left it in his car, where his possessing spirit was apparently attempting to turn Cecil on Gwen. When that fails he shrugs it off and decides to just go back to corrupting Robbie.<ref>''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' Vol. 1 #14–15</ref>

Following a vivid nightmare involving an ancient gathering of heroes that include a previous Ghost Rider, Robbie awakens in [[South Africa]] with no memory of how he got there. He is attacked by [[Star Brand]], who seeks to keep him from finding a buried [[Celestials (comics)|Celestial]]. Robbie defeats Star Brand by using the Penance Stare, an ability he previously had no idea he possessed, but somehow accidentally kills Star Brand as well.<ref>''Marvel Legacy'' #1</ref> Star Brand's death somehow reaches [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]]'s ears, the long-time ally of the original pre-historic Star Brand thought Robbie killed the current Star Brand purposely, and Robbie explains to the All-Father of Norse Gods about his accidental murder of the latter Star Brand when his Penance Stare first awakened, thus easily being forgiven and become friends.<ref>''Avengers'' (2018) #700</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Robbie differs from previous Ghost Riders, mainly because he is not possessed by a Spirit of Vengeance or any similar demonic entity. Rather, he is possessed by the spirit of Eli Morrow, a deceased serial killing Satanist who worked for the Russian mob as a hit-man. Despite this, he can still perform abilities similar to his predecessors; he possesses superhuman strength and durability and is able to conjure hellfire, wield a supernaturally strong chain weapon, and banish people to Hell.<ref>''All-New Ghost Rider'' #5</ref><ref name="Twelve">''All-New Ghost Rider'' #12</ref> Unlike previous Ghost Riders who rode on motorcycles, Robbie drives a 1969 [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#1969|Dodge Charger R/T]] which he refers to as the Hell Charger. The Hell Charger is linked to the Ghost Rider, allowing Robbie in his Ghost Rider form to instantly teleport to and/or merge with the car. The Charger can also be driven remotely, and Robbie's Ghost Rider form can pass harmlessly through it, allowing it to drive into foes. The car's [[trunk (car)|trunk]], when opened, acts as a portal, allowing the Ghost Rider to transport anything, including people, to any location. Eli is shown to able to take control of Robbie's body whenever he feels that he isn't up to the task or when Robbie gives into negative emotion, which is signified in his human form by a pallid skin tone and both of his eyes turning orange.<ref name="Eight">''All-New Ghost Rider'' #8</ref> During his battle with [[Star Brand]], Robbie discovers that he possesses the Penance Stare, which allows him to force anyone who makes eye contact with him to experience all of the pain and suffering they have ever inflicted on others.<ref>''Marvel Legacy'' #1</ref> His Ghost Rider form can also evolve into a stronger, more demonic form when Robbie is sufficiently angered, though this transformation is harder to control and more destructive.<ref>''Robbie Reyes: Ghost Rider'' #5</ref>

== Other versions ==
During the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, a variation of Robbie and his brother Gabe live south of Doomstadt on [[Battleworld]]. Robbie and several of his friends are arrested by the Thor Corps when patrol bots discover that Robbie possesses an "igniter spirit." He is taken to the Killiseum and forced to participate in [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s Ghost Races. Dubbed "The Hell-Charger" to distinguish himself from other Ghost Riders, Robbie loses his first race, but makes a deal with his spirit Eli to win every race onward becoming popular with audiences.<ref>''Ghost Racers'' #1-2 (2015). Marvel Comics.</ref> Robbie later kills a monster that was created using his friends. Realizing the severity of his new life, Robbie escapes as Eli could not be controlled by [[Zadkiel (comics)|Zadkiel]]. Robbie discovers that Gabe was kidnapped by Arcade and forced to race in the races.<ref>''Ghost Racers'' #3 (2015). Marvel Comics.</ref> Robbie returned to the Killiseum where he defeats Zadkiel and frees the other racers. Afterwards, Eli kills Arcade and the Ghost Riders decide to become the Spirits of Vengeance.<ref>''Ghost Racers'' #4 (2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the 2017 "Venomverse" storyline, a symbiote version of Reyes appears, calling himself '''Host Rider'''. This version is now little more than a puppet being controlled by Morrow and the symbiote, who had united against him, and has been recruited into a resistance against a species that take over symbiotes and their hosts called Poisons. He is eventually assimilated by the Poisons, who is then killed by an alternate version of Carnage.
