'''Smasher''' is the name of multiple different fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Smasher first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' #107 (October 1977-February 1978), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].

A new Smasher, named Isabel Kane, appears as a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in the [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Her name was originally given as "Isabel Dare", but the collected edition of her first appearance said her surname was "Kane". According to editor [[Tom Brevoort]], this change was deliberate; he even stated that "Dare was a mistake in the first place," as the character was intended to be [[Captain Terror]]'s granddaughter from her first appearance.<ref>[http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/post/63878172632/has-izzy-dare-name-been-changed-to-kane-in-the-avengers New Brevoort Formspring]</ref>

Yet more Smashers, operating directly under Imperial control, appear in the 'Infinity' crossover.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men Annual'' #1 (Nov. 2013)</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The title of Smasher has been used by three different humanoid aliens who served in the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].

===Vril Rokk===
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
The first Smasher was Vril Rokk, who had a long, distinguished service with the Guard.  He was also romantically linked with fellow Guardsman Plutonia.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

In ''Untold Tales of Captain Marvel'' — which takes place before his first encounter with the X-Men — Smasher, the Guard, Marvel and the Kree face all meet. A small division of the Guard, Deathbolt, Smasher, Fang and Oracle had been selected to guard the personage of Deathbird, the current ruler of the Shi'ar empire. They allied, then fought with the Kree after the latter came to their assistance against a murderous attack from the Skrulls. They later are involved with a confrontation against the Brood.<ref>''Untold Tales Of Captain Marvel'' #1-3 (1997)</ref>

When [[Cassandra Nova]] was decimating the Shi'ar empire, Smasher was one of the few entities that managed to personally protect the empress [[Lilandra]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Under protest, Smasher is ordered to travel to Earth to warn the X-Men about the threat Nova posed.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He crash lands in a field full of cows. He does not make it to the mansion until well after the Imperial Guard, brainwashed by Nova, were attempting to kill the X-Men. His presence manages to convince the Guard to fight against Nova, although he and the others were swiftly defeated by her.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Smasher is later killed by [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], a powerful mutant who attempts to conquer the Shi'ar empire.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Salac Tuur===
Vril Rokk is soon replaced with another Smasher, Salac Tuur.  The new Smasher was among the Imperial Guardsmen who attacked the Kree homeworld during the wedding of [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and [[Ronan the Accuser]]. During the battle, Smasher was slain by the Inhuman [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]].<ref>''War of Kings'' #1 (March 2009)</ref>

===Third Smasher===
The uniform and title of Smasher has since been passed onto an unidentified member of the original's race.<ref>''War of Kings'' #3 (May 2009)</ref> However, the newest version of Smasher was killed by Gladiator during a raid performed by Starjammers and Guardians of the Galaxy. The Strontian praetor killed Smasher as a sign of defecting to Lilandra.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

===Izzy Kane===
A new Smasher appears in the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' relaunch as part of [[Captain America]]'s new [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] line-up.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #1 (December 2012)</ref> She joins the Avengers to help fight [[Ex Nihilo (comics)|Ex Nihilo]] on Mars.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #2</ref> She is revealed to be Isabel "Izzy" Kane, a college student and astronomer from [[Iowa]]. After finding a pair of high-tech goggles that had been left behind in a cornfield by Vril Rokk when he crashed to the Earth to warn the X-Men about Cassandra Nova, Izzy becomes the new Smasher and Earth's first member of the Imperial Guard. Izzy is introduced to [[Captain America]] by her grandfather Dan Kane, an acquaintance from World War II.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #5</ref>

As part of the Avengers, Izzy meets the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] when their ship is ambushed and crashes into a mall's parking lot.<ref>''Guardians Team Up'' #1-2 (May 2015)</ref>

When the source of mysterious seismic events was revealed to be A.I.M. Island, Smasher went to investigate along with [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]. When they arrived to the location, they were captured by A.I.M. Troopers.<ref>''Avengers World'' #1</ref> Smasher was chosen by Andrew Forson and Jude the Entropic Man to become his Messenger for the secret of the universe, that "Everything dies." Smasher is made to do so by Andrew Forson.<ref>''Avengers World'' #2</ref>

She is later seen eight months in the future as seen in the ''[[Time Runs Out]]'' storyline having started a family with teammate Sam Guthrie.<ref>''Avengers'' #35 (Sept. 2014)</ref> She later rejoins with an Avengers team headed by Roberto DaCosta and Thor. Their goal is to find the threat causing the slow death of the multiverse and to kill it. This brings Smasher in direct opposition with Captain America's group.<ref>''Avengers'' #39 - #40</ref>

Sometime later, Smasher is seen with Cannonball and their son on another planet discussing about their future together, which leads to Cannonball deciding to quit the [[U.S.Avengers]] so that he could be with his family full time.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #5</ref>

In the aftermath of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Smasher arrives on Earth and tells Sunspot that Cannonball, who was believed to be dead, is alive on another planet.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #10</ref>

===Monster===
A new Smasher not affiliated with the Imperial Guard was introduced in ''[[Monsters Unleashed (comics)|Monsters Unleashed]]''. This version is a creation of [[Kid Kaiju]] that is composed of him and his five monsters Slizzik, Hi-Vo, Aegis, Scragg and Mekara. They come together to battle the Leviathon Mother when the Leviathon Tide invaded Earth.<ref>''Monsters Unleashed'' Vol. 2 #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like his predecessors, Smasher could naturally absorb cosmic radiation from his environment in order to increase his strength to superhuman levels.

Smasher wore special goggles called "exospex" that enabled him to "download" additional superhuman powers.{{issue|date=November 2010}}  Via the exospex, he could obtain "penta-vision" (a form of [[X-ray]] vision), superhuman durability, even greater physical strength, and the ability to travel into [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] ("4-space").  Smasher was only capable of downloading one superpower at a time.

Smasher wore small anti-gravity "flight patches" that enabled him to fly. Flight patches are standard issue for Imperial Guardsmen who lack the power of flight.

==Inspiration==
Several of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]]' team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Dave Cockrum (co-creator of the Guard) also had a long run as artist on the ''Legion''. Smasher is based on LSH member [[Ultra Boy]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Other versions==

===X-Men: The End===
In the alternate future of ''X-Men: The End'', Smasher is a veteran Guardian who is on duty when the plans of the series' main villain is revealed. He attacks with a small group of other Guardians. They are all slain, as a result, with Smasher's neck being snapped.<ref>''X-Men: The End: Book 3: Men & X-Men'' #1-2 (March–April 2006)</ref>

===Star Trek/X-Men===
Smasher also appears in ''Star Trek/X-Men'' #1 (December 1996). He and several other members of the Imperial Guard assist [[Deathbird]] in a mission.

==In other media==

===Television===
* The first Smasher appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episodes "The Dark Phoenix" and "Fate of the Phoenix." He and the Imperial Guard had to fight the X-Men to determine the fate of Jean Grey after the destructions that the Phoenix Force did to some of the galaxies.
