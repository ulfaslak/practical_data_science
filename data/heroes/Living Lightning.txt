== Fictional character biography ==
Miguel Santos was born in [[East Los Angeles, California]]. Miguel's father, Carlos, was a member of an extremist group called '''the Legion of the Living Lightning'''. In a misguided attempt by the Legion to gain control of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], the group battled him.

Hoping to salvage his father's name, high school student Miguel broke into the Legion's headquarters to learn more about their work.

The [[Great Lakes Avengers]] (GLA) invited Miguel Santos in order to recruit him in their team.

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Miguel joined [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers as one of twenty new members who opposed the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. He worked with the team out of a series of [[safe house]]s set up by [[Nick Fury]]. He was part of the final battle between the two main sides. After Captain America surrendered to the authorities, Living Lightning became an Initiative recruit,<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/947/avengers_the_initiative_1_character_map Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref> joining the [[Rangers (comics)|Texas Rangers]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2</ref>

During ''[[Avengers: No Surrender]]'', Santos was the one responsible for making the Grandmaster back down and surrender the Avengers he had captured as part of the latest game through a daring bluff; by provoking the Grandmaster into a game of poker, Santos subsequently raised the stakes of the game until he reached a point where the stakes were that the loser would have all memory of their accomplishments wiped from the memories of all who knew of them, prompting Grandmaster to fold as he could not bear to lose everything like that whereas Santos accepted that being an Avenger meant doing the right thing because it was the right thing to do rather than because you would be remembered for it.<ref>''Avengers'' #689</ref>

During his tenure in the West Coast Avengers, Miguel dated women. Later, though, Miguel was approached by members of the [[Great Lakes Avengers]], who hoped to recruit them for their team. When he heard the team's acronym (GLA), Miguel mistook them for the [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|Gay/Lesbian Alliance]] and inadvertently revealed that he was gay to GLA member [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]].<ref name="Gay League"/><ref>[http://perrymoorestories.com/content/hero.asp?id=superheroes Who cares about the death of a gay superhero anyway?: a history of gays in comic books] by Perry Moore</ref>

Writer [[Dan Slott]] commented in an [[interview]] about his decision to out Living Lightning: "He's gay. Get over it. Previous girlfriends? [[Beard (female companion)|Beards]]. Or relationships that just didn't work—because Miguel hadn't come to terms yet with who he really is. Miguel is a gay superhero and a wonderful role model."<ref name="Gay League">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100709052057/http://www.gayleague.com/wordpress/2009/11/23/living-lightning/ Gay League&nbsp;– Living Lightning]</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Living Lightning gained superhuman powers when he absorbed energy from an experimental lightning weapon. Living Lightning has the ability to transform his body into electrical plasma, in which form he can fly at sub-light speed, generate electrical power as shocks or bolts, and surround himself with a protective electrical force field. He has the ability to control his body while composed of electrical plasma, at which time his mind exists only in astral form.

In his true form, Living Lightning is just that, a sentient electrical force with no mass.  In this form, he can fly, reaching sub-light speeds, withstanding the vacuum of space, and is impervious to most physical and energy attacks.  He also possesses the ability to fire and manipulate bursts of electricity and electrical fields of varying intensities in his solid form, however, he must wear a special containment suit to retain a solid form.

Miguel has knowledge of basic street-fighting techniques. He is bilingual in Spanish and English.
