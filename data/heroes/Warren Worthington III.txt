'''Warren Kenneth Worthington III''', originally known as '''Angel''' and later as '''Archangel''', is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]] and is a founding member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in [[Uncanny X-Men|''The X-Men'']] #1 (September 1963).

Angel is a member of a subspecies of humans known as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], who are born with superhuman abilities. The character originally possesses a pair of large feathered wings extending from his back, enabling him to fly. He is the heir of the Worthington family fortune, and this privileged background results in Warren being stereotyped as self-absorbed and unable to deal with hardships during his early years with the X-Men. This personality was ultimately replaced with a more introspective and brooding personality in the late 1980s, when the character was changed into the darker "Archangel" persona. While Angel's wings were originally feathered, his transition to Archangel resulted in metallic wings and newfound powers.

As one of the original X-Men, Archangel has had a frequent presence in X-Men-related [[comic book]]s throughout the years and also appeared occasionally in X-Men [[animation|animated series]] and [[video game]]s. [[Ben Foster]] played the role of Angel in the 2006 film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' and [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]] portrays him in the 2016 film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''.

==Publication history==
The character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-creator [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 (September [[1963 in comics|1963]]) as Angel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmro.travis-starnes.com/detail.php?idvalue=75 |title=Complete Marvel Reading Order – X-Men #1 |publisher=Cmro.travis-starnes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref> He appeared as a regular character in that title until it was cancelled with issue #66. The title was revived shortly after, reprinting earlier issues from issue #67 to #93. In 1970 and 1971, a three-part Angel solo feature was published as a back-up strip in ''Ka-Zar'' #2 and #3 and ''Marvel Tales'' #30.

Angel appeared in the ''X-Men'' revamp by [[Len Wein]] and [[Dave Cockrum]] in 1975 with the introduction of the "All-New, All-Different X-Men" (''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1, May 1975), but left the X-Men title with issue #94. Angel and fellow X-Man [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] were transitioned into a new series called ''[[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]]'', which ran from 1975 to 1978. Series creator [[Tony Isabella]] had wanted to do a series about Angel and Iceman traveling together on the highway, in the vein of ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', but the editors told him to make it into a full team book.<ref name="Isabella">Isabella, Tony. "Cables of Champions", ''Champions'' #6, Marvel (June 1976).</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Karen|title='We'll Keep on Fighting 'Til the End': The Story of the Champions|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65 |pages=17–23|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

Angel returned to the X-Men briefly in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #134, officially returning to the roster in issue #138 before once again leaving in issue #148. Afterwards, the character, along with fellow founding X-Men [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and Iceman, joined the roster of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], as part of a short-lived "revamp" of the title, in which the series was renamed ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The New Defenders]]''. Angel would stay with the title, as the group's leader, for the book's last three years of publication (1983–1986). The series was canceled in 1986 to free up Angel and his fellow X-Men to star in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', which debuted in February. Angel remained in the book until issue #70, which was the last issue before the book was revamped with an all-new roster. During ''X-Factor'' #16–24, the character is presumed dead after losing his wings and apparently killing himself in a plane crash. Angel was dramatically revamped as a character, given a new costume, blue skin, and metallic wings which could fire blades. He first appeared as Archangel in ''X-Factor'' #24 (January [[1988 in comics|1988]]). According to ''X-Factor'' writer [[Louise Simonson]] and penciler [[Walt Simonson]], the Archangel revamp was motivated in part by their feeling that Angel was a [[Mary Sue]] (being wealthy, handsome, and adored by women), and in part by the fact that, due to the inflation of superhero abilities, Angel was underpowered compared to other characters in the Marvel Universe.<ref name="DAK39">{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Sanderson | authorlink = Peter Sanderson | date = October 1986 | title = Walt & Louise Simonson | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 39 | pages = 42–57 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>

Angel was added to the cast of the ''Uncanny X-Men'' title and appeared in that series and its companion series ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' (vol. 2) for most of the 1990s. In 1996, Marvel also published a one-shot story simply called ''Archangel'', which was written by [[Peter Milligan]]. He also appeared alongside [[Psylocke]] in a [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] called ''Psylocke & Archangel: Crimson Dawn'' (August 1997 – November 1997, 4 issues). From 1999 to 2001, Angel also featured in the series ''[[X-Men: The Hidden Years]]'', which was set in the original X-Men's early days.

Under [[Joe Casey]] (2001–2002) and [[Chuck Austen]] (2002–2004), Angel became leader of the X-Men team that appeared in the pages of ''Uncanny X-Men''. After [[Chris Claremont]] replaced Austen on that title, the character went away for several months before reappearing in the pages of another Claremont-written series, ''Excalibur'' (vol. 3, 2004). He continued to guest-star in the ''Incredible Hulk'' title during the events of ''[[World War Hulk]]'' (2007) and then returned to the ''Uncanny X-Men'' through issue #538 (2011) while also appearing in ''[[X-Force]]'' ([[X-Force#Volume 3|vol. 3]]) (2008), where the character has regained his metallic wings and again assumed the codename Archangel, and subsequently in ''Uncanny X-Force'' (2010), in which his mind and personality were wiped.

After his personality was stripped, he appeared only as a background character, one of the students at the ''Jean Grey School'' in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (comics)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' (2011–13) until he graduated, but now spends most time off-panel at Worthington Industries.  A time-displaced version of Angel's younger self currently stars in ''[[All-New X-Men]]'' (2013–present).

===Main Timeline Warren Worthington III===
====Angel====
[[File:WarrenWorthingtonAngel.jpg|thumb|upright|Angel in ''[[Marvels]]'' #2 (Feb. 1994); art by [[Alex Ross]]. The artwork is inspired by his original design in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]]]
Warren Worthington was born in [[Centerport, New York]], to Kathryn Worthington and Warren Worthington Jr. He attends [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in his adolescence when his feathered [[wing]]s begin to grow from his shoulder blades. At first, Warren feels he is a freak and aberration, but he soon learns that he can use his wings to fly and help people. When there is a fire in his dormitory, he borrows some props from the school's drama department, dresses up as a heavenly angel, and rescues his friends. He soon learns that he is in fact a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]. He dons a mask and costume, calls himself the '''Avenging Angel''', and becomes a solo adventurer, before being recruited by [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] for the X-Men.<ref>''The X-Men'' #54–56 (March–May 1969)</ref>

Warren's status as a wealthy playboy, as well as being an outspoken individual who chafes at the notion of being told what to do, is the subject of much tension within the X-Men. In particular, Warren is in love with [[Jean Grey]], who is in love with [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]].{{Issue|date=July 2010}} Though he ultimately concedes Jean to Scott,{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Angel still harbors an unrequited love for Jean even as he finds himself a girlfriend of his own, [[Candy Southern]].<ref>''The X-Men'' #32 (May 1967)</ref>

While pursuing [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] in the [[Savage Land]], Angel is attacked by [[pteranodon]]s and falls to his death. He would have remained dead if not for the "Creator", who is [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] without his costume. Magneto provides the necessary medical treatment needed to revive Angel, and provides him with a new blue-and-white costume.<ref>''The X-Men'' #62 (November 1969)</ref> Unknown to Angel, the costume also has a device installed that lets Magneto gain control over Angel, which he does months later when he makes an attack on the X-Men.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

Around this time, Angel publicly reveals himself as a mutant after discovering that not only has his uncle, Burt Worthington (who goes by the name of the Dazzler — though he is in no way related to Alison Blaire, a later mutant heroine and brief love interest for Warren in her own comic series who also uses the name), murdered Warren's father, Warren Worthington, Jr.,<ref>''Ka-Zar'' #2–3 (December 1970, March 1971); ''Marvel Tales'' #30 (April 1971)</ref> but also poisoned his mother in order to ensure his inheritance of the Worthington fortune.<ref>''X-Men the Hidden Years'' #16–18</ref>

When the original X-Men are captured by the mutant island [[Krakoa]], Professor X creates a new team of X-Men to rescue them.<ref>''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (1975).</ref> When this new team decides to stay on as X-Men, Angel and the rest of the original team, with the exception of Cyclops, leave.<ref>''The X-Men'' #94 (August 1975).</ref> He and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] go to Los Angeles, where they found the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]] with [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], and the original [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]].<ref>''Champions'' #1–3</ref> Following the apparent death of Jean Grey and Cyclops' subsequent exile from the team, Warren rejoins the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #138</ref> During this time, Angel unsuccessfully pursues pop star Alison Blaire, also known as [[Dazzler (comics)|Dazzler]].{{Issue|date=March 2010}} He grows increasingly disturbed by the behavior and actions of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #140 (December 1980)</ref> and quits the team in protest.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #148 (August 1981)</ref>

He is kidnapped by the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] leader [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], who intends to force Angel to be her lover. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], and [[Kitty Pryde|Sprite]] arrive in time to stop Callisto from cutting off Angel's wings (believing that without them, Angel will be unable to flee from her). Storm fights and defeats Callisto for the right to be the leader of the Morlocks, effectively freeing Angel in the process.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #169–170 (May–June 1983)</ref>

Shortly thereafter, Angel joins the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], along with Beast, Iceman and girlfriend Candy Southern.<ref>''Defenders'' #124 (October 1983); ''New Defenders'' #125 (November 1983)</ref> Using Angel's Colorado house as their base, the group has several adventures before most of the group are killed freeing teammate [[Moondragon]] from demonic possession.<ref>''The New Defenders'' #152 (February 1986)</ref>

Angel considers retirement following the collapse of the Defenders, but the discovery of Jean Grey alive changes his mind. Jean Grey is furious at the increase in anti-mutant hysteria in the two years she has been missing, and opposes the X-Men's decision to align themselves with the villain Magneto. To appease Jean's desire for action, Warren organizes X-Factor.<ref>''X-Factor'' #1 (February 1986)</ref> He recruits his old prep school friend [[Cameron Hodge]] to run the team, unaware that Cameron hates mutants, particularly Warren.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Since Cyclops is married to [[Madelyne Pryor]] at the time and reacts coldly to Jean's return, Angel takes advantage of Jean's need for emotional support and expresses his love for her.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} This destroys Warren's relationship with Candy Southern, after Candy finds Warren consoling Jean.<ref>''X-Factor'' #10 (November 1986)</ref>

====Archangel====
[[Image:Xf024cvr.jpg|left|thumbnail|Cover of ''X-Factor'' #24; art by [[Walt Simonson]]]]
X-Factor's formation begins a period of upheaval in Warren's life. Cameron Hodge abuses Warren's trust and portrays X-Factor as "mutant hunters" for hire, further fueling anti-mutant sentiment.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} An altercation with the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] allows [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] to discover the relationship between the "mutant hunters" and the former X-Men; she exposes Warren as the financial backer for X-Factor, causing a public relations nightmare.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Warren's wings are mutilated during the [[Mutant Massacre]] by the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauder]], [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]].<ref>''Thor'' #373–374</ref> When the wings develop gangrene, [[Cameron Hodge]] violates Angel's wishes and has the crippled wings [[amputation|amputated]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #14</ref> Despondent over the loss, Warren escapes the hospital and commandeers his private jet. It explodes in the air as the rest of X-Factor watch helplessly from below.<ref>''X-Factor'' #15</ref> It is ultimately revealed that Hodge sabotaged Warren's plane in order to finish off his nemesis, in an apparent suicide.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

Seconds before the explosion, Warren is spirited away by the ancient mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Apocalypse offers to restore Angel's wings if Angel will serve him as one of his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #18</ref> Apocalypse subjects Angel to extensive genetic alterations, giving him blue skin and organic metal wings which can cut through almost anything. The wings can fire the metal feathers as projectiles. Apocalypse gives Worthington the title of Death. He makes Worthington the leader of his Horsemen after Worthington beats the others in a fight, and gives him a drug that remove his reservations to follow Apocalypse's dark plans.<ref>''X-Factor'' #17, 21</ref> Death is unveiled to X-Factor during their second encounter with the Horsemen,<ref>''X-Factor'' #23</ref> and Warren sadistically exploits the weaknesses of his friends to defeat them in combat.<ref>"X-Factor" #24</ref> During a later attack on Manhattan, Iceman fakes his own death at Warren's hands, hoping that the shock of killing a friend will enable him to break free of the influence of Apocalypse's drug. Although freed, Warren refuses to rejoin X-Factor, feeling that he has changed too much psychologically to be a hero.<ref>''X-Factor'' #25</ref>

He seeks out Candy Southern, but finds that she is missing.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Warren learns that Candy has been lobotomized to protect Cameron Hodge's secrets, including the establishment of the anti-mutant militia "The Right" using funds embezzled from Worthington.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} In the confrontation that follows, Hodge murders Candy in front of Warren and Warren decapitates Hodge.<ref>''X-Factor'' #34</ref> Changing his codename from "Death" to "Dark Angel", he later rejoins X-Factor and takes the codename "Archangel" during the events of ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]''.<ref>''X-Factor'' #36</ref>

Warren later meets and becomes romantically involved with [[Charlotte Jones (comics)|Charlotte Jones]], a [[New York City Police Department|New York City Police]] officer and single mother.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} It is with Charlotte's help that X-Factor frees Warren from the Ravens, a cult of near-immortal psychic vampires.<ref>''X-Factor'' #57–59</ref> It is during this battle that Warren's survival is made public knowledge, allowing him to regain control over his family's remaining business holdings and his personal fortune.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} X-Factor rejoins the X-Men following the defeat of the [[Shadow King]] on [[Muir Island]].{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

====Angel again====
After rejoining the X-Men, Archangel's brooding behavior lessens, after Jean reveals to Warren that his wings (which Warren believes have a mind of their own) have actually been operating off Warren's own unconscious desires for violence.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #293</ref> This, combined with Warren's accidental decapitation of [[Mutant Liberation Front]] member [[Kamikaze (comics)|Kamikaze]],<ref>''X-Factor'' #85</ref> leads Warren to try to reject the dark cloud that has hung over his head ever since gaining his new wings. His relationship with Charlotte Jones fades as Warren begins dating fellow X-Men member [[Psylocke]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #319, December 1994</ref> In an attempt to put his dark days behind him, Warren retires his "Death" uniform in favor of the blue/white costume Magneto made for him.{{issue|date=June 2018}}

After Psylocke is eviscerated by X-Men prisoner [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] during an escape attempt, Warren and the X-Men track him down and capture him, but not before he is able to badly damage Warren's metal wings.<ref>''Sabretooth Special'' #1 - In The Red, September 1995</ref> Over time, the damage to his wings spreads. Eventually, the metal wings shatter completely, revealing that his feathered wings have been growing back within them and have broken them apart from the inside.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #338</ref> This follows a visit from [[Ozymandias (Marvel Comics)|Ozymandias]], who tells him that he is indeed one of Apocalypse's chosen ones.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Reclaiming his original '''Angel''' powers, Warren still retains his blue skin color.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

Angel is one of several X-Men who are present when [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'s culpability in the events of the "Mutant Massacre" is made public by Magneto, which turns him against his teammate.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #350</ref> Shortly afterwards, with the X-Men broke and their mansion stripped bare by the US Government, Angel volunteers money to help keep the team going, though this requires his reclaiming full control over his family company to do so.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Tracking some of his company's finances at this time, Warren discovers the former villains the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] retrieving a jet that was used by the Champions, but although initially suspicious of the Thunderbolts' motives, after joining them in a confrontation with [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], Warren accepts their genuine desire to reform, leaving them with the jet as he wishes them luck.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol.1 #27-30</ref> Angel returns to the X-Men following the events of ''[[Apocalypse: The Twelve|The Twelve]]'', in which his wings (temporarily) further mutate into wings made of light and he gains talon-like hands and healing powers, which Warren uses to restore the mobility of crippled Horseman of Apocalypse [[War (Marvel Comics character)#War (Abraham Kieros)|War]].{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Returning to the X-Men, Warren finds his relationship with Psylocke gone, as she has begun dating new X-Men recruit [[Neal Shaara|Thunderbird]] III.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

[[Image:ArchangelThunderbolts.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Archangel with his feathered wings]]

When [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] leaves the X-Men to join Storm's splinter group ([[X-Treme X-Men]]), Angel is promoted to head of the X-Men's field team.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Angel's squad fights the anti-mutant group [[Church of Humanity (comics)|Church of Humanity]]{{Issue|date=September 2009}} and Mystique and her newest incarnation of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants,{{Issue|date=September 2009}} and tangles with the [[Vanisher]], who has gone into business with several medical companies to create a designer drug that could give humans mutant-like powers.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Angel also becomes entangled in a love triangle with rookie X-Men member [[Paige Guthrie]] and the mutant prostitute [[Stacy X]].{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Furthermore, during a battle with [[Black Tom Cassidy]], Angel's regression to his pre-"Death" state is complete when he reverts to his normal Caucasian skin color when Cassidy (now turned into a plant-type [[vampire]]) attempts to drain Angel's life force from him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #412</ref> His healing powers from ''The Twelve'' also manifest themselves again, in the form of the revelation that Angel's blood has miracle healing properties.{{issue|date=December 2011}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weiner|first1=Robert G.|title=Marvel Graphic Novels and Related Publications: An Annotated Guide to Comics, Prose Novels, Children's Books, Articles, Criticism and Reference Works, 1965-2005|date=2008|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=9780786451159|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npIsZV7grboC&pg=PA105#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=9 May 2016}}</ref>

====Decimation====
Following the death of Jean Grey, Warren and Paige take an extended leave of absence from the team.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Warren begins doing overseas charity work at this point, in the form of a charity called "Mutants Sans Frontières" in [[Zanzibar]] (a reference to [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]]), where he then proceeds to help stop a [[coup]] with the aid of Professor X's newest charges from nearby [[Genosha]].<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 2 #11–12 (May–June 2005)</ref> In ''Excalibur'', Warren meets up again with [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]]. As Paige reminds Warren of his history with Callisto, Viper attacks, but Warren and Callisto defeat Viper together.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 2 #12 (June 2005)</ref>

In ''[[Generation M (comics)|Generation M]]'', Angel fakes having lost his wings in order to capture the [[Ghoul (comics)|Ghoul]], a deranged [[serial killer]] who uses his retained mutant powers to murder ex-mutants.<ref>''Generation M'' #5</ref>

Though not an active member of any team, Warren reunites with the other surviving original X-Men — Cyclops, Iceman, and Beast — in a mission to stop [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] from recapturing the fugitive mutants known as [[X-Men: The 198|the 198]],{{Issue|date=September 2009}} though Bishop later joins them in their rescue attempt.<ref>''[[Civil War: X-Men]]''</ref>

====World War Hulk====
Angel joins with fellow former [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]] member [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], [[Namora]], and [[Amadeus Cho]] in order to calm down the rampaging [[Hulk]].<ref>''[[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]'' #107</ref> Afterward, Angel discovers that Amadeus Cho has hacked into Warren's bank accounts and stolen several million dollars from him, to help him further aid the Hulk.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

====Messiah Complex====
Angel is part of the team that investigates the new mutant birth in Alaska.<ref>''X-Men Messiah Complex'' (2007)</ref> He is later part of the team who is looking for former [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #492 (2008)</ref> He is next seen part of the same team, but attacking the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]].<ref>''New X-Men'' Vol.2 #44 (2008)</ref> Warren goes against [[Mister Sinister]], but is easily defeated once Sinister recovers from [[Emma Frost]]'s mental attack.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol.2 #205 (2008)</ref> Angel is knocked out, but recovers and is present with the X-teams for the final battle over the fate of the baby.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol.2 #207 (2008)</ref>

====Divided We Stand====
Angel is later seen flying over San Francisco, going to meet with [[Hepzibah (comics)|Hepzibah]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], and Iceman, when he stumbles across an area that looks as if the 1960s never ended. He contacts Scott and Emma, asking them for assistance before suffering the mind-altering effects of the zone, which are revealed to be caused by [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #495</ref> Angel and the three other ensnared X-Men are sent by Martinique to confront Scott and Emma.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #498</ref> Emma manages to free them from the illusion and, during the fall-out battle, Angel rescues Mayor [[Sadie Sinclair (comics)|Sadie Sinclair]]. Thankful for the assistance and for the idea of having real superheroes in their city, Mayor Sinclair then talks to Cyclops and Angel about helping them resettle the X-Men in San Francisco.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #499</ref>

====Archangel returns====
In ''X-Force'' (vol. 3) #4, Warren is brutally attacked by a mind-controlled [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]. During the attack, Wolfsbane savagely rips Warren's feather wings from his back and runs away, taking the wings with her.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 3) #4</ref> It is revealed by [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] that Warren's wings, despite appearing fully organic, are actually still [[T. O. virus|techno-organic]] constructs that he is unable to regenerate{{issue|date=January 2011}}. Wolfsbane later delivers them to the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]], who are seeking the Apocalypse Strain, the techno-organics which comprise Warren's wings. The Purifiers use the Apocalypse Strain to modify an army of Purifier agents, giving them the same metallic wings that Archangel once had.{{issue|date=January 2011}} Meanwhile, although [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] is able to heal all of Warren's injuries, he cannot regrow his wings due to interference from the Apocalypse Strain. Later in the story, Warren is gripped by a series of excruciating seizures that not only mysteriously regenerate his techno-organic wings, but also transform him back into Apocalypse's version of Death/Archangel, complete with blue skin and a techno-organic version of his uniform.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 2) #4</ref>

X-Force attacks Archangel, who eventually asks for relief from the pain of losing his wings and transforming into Archangel.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 2) #5</ref> Archangel escapes, to take revenge on the Purifiers, and at their headquarters he slaughters most of them in a blood-maddened rage. Once the battle is over, he reverts to his normal Caucasian, feather-winged appearance. He comments to [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] that he can still feel the metal wings inside him, and that they want to come out again. According to Elixir, Warren's transformation is permanent, implying that he is fully capable of transforming back into Archangel again at any time.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 2) #6</ref>

In an attempt to understand what was done to both Wolfsbane and Angel, the pair of them are placed in a room together, where Rahne is forced to gaze at Warren. The mere sight of him causes her to become murderous once again, and she attempts to rip the wings from Warren's body once more. The sight of a psychotic Wolfsbane, as well as the fear of having his wings torn from his body again, causes a defensive reaction in Warren, reverting him back into his violent Archangel persona.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

From then on, Angel takes dual membership with both the X-Men and X-Force, though Cyclops forbids Angel from telling the rest of the team about the return of his Archangel powers.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} While recruiting a scientist for Beast's "Science Squad", the X-Club, Angel is forced to transform into Archangel in order to destroy a giant rampaging monster. Beast reacts in anger that Angel has not told him that his "Death" powers have returned, creating tension between the two friends. Angel knows telling Beast would expose the latest incarnation of X-Force and effectively end Cyclops' latest tenure as leader if the truth about his personal black ops squad became public knowledge.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

During the X-Club's trip to 1906 in order to discover the origins of the modern mutant race, Angel transforms into Archangel a number of times to help further their mission.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Wolverine and Archangel interrogate Purifiers member Benedict Ryan on where Jonathan Standish is hiding out.<ref>''Fear Itself: Uncanny X-Force'' #2</ref>

====Dark Angel Saga====
In the "Dark Angel Saga", the "Archangel" persona of Warren, which was secretly created when he was first transformed by Apocalypse into his  Horseman of Death, has finally taken over his mind, and he plans to be the heir to Apocalypse, bringing [[Ozymandias (Marvel Comics)|Ozymandias]], [[Dark Beast]], [[Horsemen of Apocalypse#The Final Horsemen|the Final Horsemen]], [[Famine (comics)|Autumn Rolfson]], and her son Genocide as his army to destroy humanity.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #11–16</ref> At the conclusion of the story arc Betsy stabs Archangel in the chest with the Celestial Life Seed, seemingly killing him. In the aftermath of the explosion of Apocalypse's citadel, Warren is seen by the members of X-Force walking in the snow. Psylocke, shocked that he is alive and apparently free of Apocalypse, runs up and embraces him. This Warren then reveals he had no idea who Psylocke is and appears to have amnesia. Warren has his normal white skin again but seems to have retained his metallic wings.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #18</ref>

====Death and new personality====
Following the Dark Angel Saga, it is revealed that Warren had indeed died and his soul departed for the afterlife, with his Celestial-mutated body now hosting an all-new personality with its own soul. He lost leadership of Worthington Industries and became a student in [[Wolverine and the X-Men (comics)|Wolverine's new school for mutants]].<ref name="wx4" />
[[File:Amnesiac_angel.jpg|thumb|left|"Warren" after being created by the Celestial Life Seed]]
Although the new entity, who has chosen to retain the same name of Warren Worthington III and the code name of "Angel" is making efforts to be integrated, it is clear that he has no memory at all of the original Warren Worthington's friends and acquaintances, as his discussions with Iceman demonstrate and how he turned away former lover Psylocke.<ref name="wx4">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' 4 (2012)</ref>

When Wolverine's legs were damaged Warren tried to fix them with a "miracle". When he failed he wanted to try it again but Wolverine wouldn't allow him, so he and a few other students went to the casino on Planet Sin. There they took the device that damaged their headmaster's legs so it could be used to heal him. While doing so he forged a friendship with Evan, a clone of Apocalypse.{{issue|date=April 2016}}

Warren tried to prove that he truly was a real angel by flying to heaven but he failed and accepted the fact that he was mutant. While falling he was saved by Evan and revealed that he could see the essence of people when he looked at them. Evan asked him what he saw when he looked at him and despite seeing only the image of Apocalypse, Warren told him that he could see nothing but goodness in him.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' # 10 (2012)</ref>

Warren left the school with Bobby and Rachel to help his fellow mutants in the battle against the Avengers.{{issue|date=April 2016}} After the battle, he returned to join the stand against Cyclops, and has since regained all of his memories.{{issue|date=April 2016}}

====Warren's children====
In an apocalyptic possible future, an aging [[Punisher|Frank Castle]] warns the present-day [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] of the "son of Archangel".<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #29 (2012)</ref> During ''Uncanny Avengers'' (2013), it is revealed that while preparing to ascend as Apocalypse during the "Dark Angel Saga", Warren fathered two children with Pestilence of [[Horsemen of Apocalypse#The Final Horsemen|the Final Horsemen]], who appear as the time-traveling "[[Apocalypse Twins]]".<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #7 (2013)</ref>

====All-New, All-Different Marvel====
As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Angel has mysteriously reverted somehow to his pre-LifeSeed blue-skinned Archangel form, and appears as a member of Magneto's [[Uncanny X-Men#2015–present: Volume 4|new Uncanny X-Men]] in order to protect mutantkind at all costs. His mind had also changed, having become nothing more than a silent and mindless predator controlled by Psylocke. Under her psychic leash, Archangel became a heavy hitter in Magneto's X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4 #1</ref>

====Apocalypse Wars====
Psylocke and Magneto travel to Green Ridge, Colorado to investigate reports of an up-and-coming preacher who looks identical to the original Angel. They discover that he is indeed the Angel who was created by the Celestial LifeSeed and he is attracting a cult of religious fanatics around him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4, #6</ref> It is revealed that during the 8-month timeskip after the events of Secret Wars, Angel allied himself with Apocalypse's son, [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Genocide]] and the [[Clan Akkaba]] in exchange for their help in controlling his Horseman of Death split-personality, which has revived as it is permanently linked to his own metal wings. Clan Akkaba are constantly harvesting Angel's rapidly-regenerating metal wings (in order to prevent the Death persona from fully possessing Angel) and grafting them into his clones, creating a mindless clone army of blue-skinned Archangels. The silent Archangel who is a member of Magneto's team of X-Men was merely the first such clone who retained trace memories of the original Angel and thus managed to escape to join Magneto's X-Men. Magneto and Psylocke are captured, but Psylocke easily escapes. She gets into a fight with Fantomex, who was sent by Magneto as back-up with Mystique, who herself freed Magneto.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4, #8</ref> Psylocke in a panic calls for the Archangel who is their teammate, who then telepathically controls the rest of the clone army into destroying the town, but the clones are all killed.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4, #9</ref> In a flashback, it is revealed that Magneto accidentally found Angel's unconscious and injured body in a barn during the 8-month timeskip and helped him recover. Magneto at the time gave up on being a hero, as the rest of the X-Men had either disbanded or fled to Limbo, but then was inspired by Angel to restart his own version of the Uncanny X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4, #7</ref> It is implied that Angel disappeared after that encounter, only to "reappear" as the silent Archangel. In the present, a chastised and repentant Angel explains to Magneto and Psylocke that he and the silent Archangel are ultimately two half-parts of the same one being, so they physically combine into a new blue-skinned persona. This new Archangel being is unsure of who or what he now was, but was determined to find out. He swore off all violence and returned with Magneto's X-Men to their base in the Savage Land.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4, #10</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
=== Main Timeline Warren Worthington III===
====As Angel====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Warren's primary power is that of natural [[flight]], due to his large feathered wings. His wings have [[superhuman]] strength, and they have a very flexible skeletal structure that enables him to press them to the back of his torso and legs with only the slightest bulge visible under his clothing. His bones are hollow, his body processes food much more efficiently than a normal human body and does not store any excess fat, and he possesses a greater proportionate muscle mass than normal. As a result, his strength, speed, agility, flexibility, endurance, reflexes, coordination, balance, eyesight and hearing are at their peak. Elements of his anatomy are comparable to those of birds, especially [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]]. His eyes can withstand high-speed winds which would damage the average human eye. He can breathe at high velocities or altitudes, and he can cope with the reduced temperatures at high altitudes for prolonged periods of time, giving him a greater-than-normal capacity to endure low temperatures in areas such as the Arctic. The strength in his natural wings can easily break a man's arm or leg, or even put someone through a wall.

While he generally flies below the height of clouds, Angel can reach almost twice this height with little effort. At his absolute maximum, he can reach the highest recorded altitude of a bird in flight — about the height of [[Mount Everest]] — but he can only remain that high for a few minutes. Although flight is as natural a mode of transportation for Angel as for a bird, he can only fly nonstop under his own power for around half a day.

He has undergone heavy training with [[Professor X]], especially in mastering his flight indoors. He has demonstrated superior agility, flexibility, reflexes, coordination, and balance while flying, and has been shown defeating superbeings much faster than him (like the [[Human Torch]]{{Issue|date=February 2010}}) by dodging them and having them smash against the ground or a wall at full speed.

Angel is also an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having defeated several of the werewolf-like ''homo superior'' when Wolverine is defeated.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} He is trained in hand-to-hand combat at Xavier's school; while dating Psylocke, he receives a considerable amount of martial arts instruction.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} During his years on the team, he is given extensive training from Wolverine, and when he once surprises Wolverine after taking down some men, he says, "My father spoiled me with more than money."{{Issue|date=February 2010}} He also receives further instruction from the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] during his days with the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]].{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

As the result of a [[secondary mutation]] which has been shown inconsistently, Angel also develops a healing factor and can heal others by mixing his blood with theirs, provided they have a matching [[blood type]] to Warren's.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} His healing blood does not work with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #431 (Nov. 2003)</ref> Although powerful, this mutation varies in potency. At times, he cannot aid the terminally wounded; at others, he can actually raise the recently dead.{{issue|date=July 2012}} This secondary mutation suggests that he may be descended from the ancient race of [[Cheyarafim]] mutants.{{issue|date=July 2012}} He is nearly immune to injury because his healing blood is constantly flowing through him. At its onset, he repairs broken bones in days,{{issue|date=July 2012}} but his healing abilities have enhanced since then.{{issue|date=July 2012}} In an issue of ''X-Force'' is apparent that this healing factor comes from his wings as seen when Warren is savagely attacked and his wings are ripped from his body, his healing factor fails to work, and he instead must be healed by [[Elixir (comics)|Josh Foley]]. It is revealed that the Celestial Technology bonded to him by Apocalypse prevents Elixir from regenerating his wings.{{issue|date=July 2012}} They eventually regenerate on their own.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

Aside from his superhuman powers, the original Warren was a most-highly capable businessman and the new Warren has accordingly retained or "inherited" his position as the primary stockholder and chairman emeritus (former chairman) of the board-of-directors of Worthington Industries.

====As Archangel====
Archangel possesses a set of metal techno-organic wings grafted onto him by the genetic engineering of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] when Apocalypse renames him the Horseman of Death.<ref>''X-Factor'' #24</ref> These wings are composed of a hard, sharp, organic material that resembles the "organic steel" of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]' body. The wings give him the ability to project his metallic feathers out from his wings at great speed and with tremendous force, enabling them to pierce even steel.

Archangel does not have complete control over his feathers, which sometimes shoot from his wings against his conscious will in response to his unconscious aggressive drives. The feathers are laced with a neural inhibitor chemical, generated by Archangel's body, which induces temporary [[paralysis]].
[[File:Archangel_wing_projectiles.jpg|thumb|Warren as Archangel firing projectiles from his metallic wings]]
These wings allow him to fly at speeds much faster than his natural, feathered wings. The edges of these metal wings are also razor sharp, allowing them to be used as weapons.

While he believes he has lost his metal wings when he re-grows his organic ones, the Celestial Technology never leaves his system, and his natural-appearing wings contain the Celestial technology. When implanted into regular human beings, the technology induces a transformation similar to that of Warren's. When his feathered wings are severed from his body by Wolfsbane, his metal wings grow back in their place. Furthermore, his skin reverts to blue and his old Archangel costume appears.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} Warren's body returns to normal — the metal wings being replaced with the appearance of his feathered ones — indicating that Warren has the ability to switch between metal and feathered wings and his Angel and Archangel appearances.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol.3) #7</ref> 
During a battle with [[Selene (comics)|Selene's]] Coven, Blink teleports Warren's wings apart, shredding them to pieces. However, within minutes, they begin to painfully re-grow, indicating his healing factor may still exist.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} The wings have been shown capable to heal Apocalypse.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}. In issue 14 of ''X-Men: Second Coming'', Dr. Nemesis questions the rate that they would grow as the biology is different from Colossus' armor.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

After the death of Warren and the Archangel persona via the Life Seed, Angel comes back to life as an [[amnesiac]] with healing powers far beyond what he was ever able to originally accomplish, as demonstrated when he resurrects a recently dead dog.<ref name="wx4" />

===Time-displaced Warren Worthington III===
====Cosmic Power wings====
The time displaced Warren, from [[All-New X-Men]], initially started with feathered wings, but during [[The Black Vortex]] saga, he submitted to the vortex and was imbued with Cosmic wings.{{issue|date=May 2017}} Most of the other heroes who submitted returned their powers, but Warren did not; hoping to change his future with the new powers.{{issue|date=May 2017}} These new wings allow him to travel at faster than light speeds. He can also discharge cosmic blasts that can destroy spaceships. He can also feed off cosmic energy, thus survive in outer space and without sustenance.{{issue|date=December 2018}} These wings were surgically removed by a younger version of Cable and replaced with wings that Mimic had copied from Angel in their original meeting, allowing him to be returned to the past with no effect on the timeline.{{issue|date=December 2018}}

==Other versions==

===1602===
In the [[Marvel 1602|1602]] timeline, Warren becomes Werner, a young ''witchbreed'' (as mutants are known in this reality) who hides his mutation using garments sewn by his mother. Unfortunately, he is captured and almost burnt at the stake by the Grand Inquisitor [[Alternative versions of Magneto#1602|Enrique]] (a.k.a. Magneto), but rescued at the last moment by [[Carlos Javier]] and his students. Safe in England, Werner befriends [[Alternative versions of Jean Grey#1602|John Grey]] unaware that "Master John" is in fact a young woman disguised as a man. This friendship causes jealousy on the part of [[Alternative versions of Cyclops#1602|Scotius Summerisle]], who knows of the deception and fears Werner also knows and is trying to court her. They almost come to blows but are reconciled when circumstances lead to Jean's death. It then comes to light that Werner is unaware of Master John's true gender but states that he "was in love with that young man".

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'', Warren is never remade as Death by Apocalypse, nor does he ever join the X-Men. Instead, as most of New York is destroyed, Angel works with Apocalypse's mutant elite, Magneto and his X-Men, and even the Human High Council to maintain and operate a nightclub aptly named Heaven, where humans and mutants can intermingle. When two of his employees, Scarlett MacKenzie and [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], are apprehended and later killed, Angel finally chooses a side. Strapping himself down with a number of bombs, he attacks Apocalypse's citadel in a [[suicide attack|suicide run]]. His sacrifice shuts down the protective shields surrounding the citadel, providing the X-Men with a much needed entrance.

===Earth-5701===
In Earth-5701, an Age of Apocalypse-like reality seen in ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' #15, Warren has also been turned into Death and helps Apocalypse conquer the world.

===Earth X===
In this alternate universe, Warren loses his fortune and becomes an authentic angel, who helps anybody who needs him. He joins the New York City Police and his old friend [[Iceman (comics)#Earth X|Iceman]] to protect the world-altering Torch of the city against the forces of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. Later, he travels with [[Mister Fantastic]] and others to the [[Negative Zone]] in the search for Paradise.

===Exiles===
Archangel appeared in the comic book ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' as a member of [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]], a more ruthless version of the self-titled reality hopping team. This Archangel, hailing from Earth-714, appears very much like his [[Earth-616]] counterpart, even wearing a costume very similar to the one the 616-version wears at the time. Of course, this Archangel, since he is selected for Weapon X rather than the Exiles themselves, is more savage, employing the excessive use of automatic weapons. Archangel is, at some point, replaced by a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]ic version of [[Ms. Marvel]] after he is supposedly sent home for completing his number of missions. He is actually placed in the Panoptichron gallery of fallen Exiles. Why he is placed there is unknown, but he is one of only five recruits to return home alive and intact, alongside [[She-Hulk]], [[Barnell Bohusk#Exiles|Beak]], [[Alternative versions of Iron Man#Exiles|Iron Man]], and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].

===Marvel Zombies===
Angel is infected by the zombies [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Ms. Marvel#Marvel Zombies|Ms. Marvel]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}} He participates in a zombie attack on the castle of [[Doctor Doom]]. The zombies have detected unaffected humans inside.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} He later appears in [[Marvel Zombies 3]] when he attacks [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]], Ultron and [[Machine Man]], but he is killed soon after.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Angel is also confirmed as one of the few X-Men who attack [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}<!-- huh? Wolverine kills Zombie Juggernaut in Marvel Zombies 05 (2006) -->

===Mutant X===
In the alternate reality represented in the comic book ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'', Warren Worthington is captured by Apocalypse much like he is in the main Marvel timeline. Instead of blue skin and metallic wings, this version of Warren is given chalk white skin, leathery bat-wings, razor sharp claws and fangs, and the ability to breathe fire. Able to shake off Apocalypse's brainwashing, but still affected by the horrors he has endured, he becomes bitter, and often lashes out at his teammates in the superhero team the Six. Though he insists on being called the Fallen, his friends still call him Warren, to his chagrin. The Six is a continuation of the original X-Men legacy, in a reality where [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]] was the first X-Man instead of his older brother [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott]].<ref>''Mutant X'' #1 (October 1998)</ref>

When [[Madelyne Pryor]] becomes possessed by the Goblin Force and takes over New York, the Fallen defects from the Six alongside her,<ref>''Mutant X'' #7 (April 1999)</ref> and vanishes after her defeat. He next appears allied again with Apocalypse against the threat of the Xavier/[[Shadow King]] entity.<ref>''Mutant X'' #19 and 22</ref> He is one of the very few surviving heroes after the combined attack of the Goblin Force controlled [[Beyonder]] and the revived Dracula. He allies himself with a reformed Six.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

He makes one final appearance at the end of the series, when [[Doctor Strange]] summons the Fallen, along with Xavier, [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], and others to help Alex prepare for his battle with the [[Beyonder]].{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

===New Exiles===
On the world of the Sons of Iron and Daughters of the Dragon, the New Exiles face a squad of alternate "core X-Men" who are loyal to [[Lilandra]]. These X-Men include an alternate version of Warren who is codenamed "Krait" and has many similarities to his Archangel [[Earth-616]] appearance.<ref>''New Exiles'' #15</ref>

===Shadow-X===
[[New Excalibur]] battles an evil counterpart of Angel, who is a member of the [[Shadow-X]], the X-Men of an alternate reality in which Professor X is possessed by the [[Shadow King]]. They are brought to [[Earth-616]] as a result of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. He is later killed by one of the Shadow Captains.

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[Image:Ultimate X-Men 40 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Ultimate Angel on the cover of ''Ultimate X-Men'' #40.]]
The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Angel (Warren Worthington III) is one of only a few mutants to identifiably be a mutant at birth. Warren comes from millionaire, mutant-bigoted parents who quickly sign guardianship of him over to [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Charles Xavier]]. Warren joins the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] taking the code name Angel, though he proves to be an inexperienced and reluctant fighter.{{issue|date=June 2012}} There is much controversy over Angel joining the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]], as there are many protests of angels being a sign of God; also, [[Rogue (comics)#Ultimate Rogue|Rogue]] does not like the fact that he has the appearance of an angel.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #40</ref> On an unauthorized mission to [[Genosha#Ultimate Marvel|Genosha]], Angel and his teammates attempt to rescue [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Longshot]], an accused murderer who is facing a public execution.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #54</ref> During the ''Magnetic North'' storyline, [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Dazzler]] and Warren go to the Triskelion in an attempt to rescue [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #63</ref> After Magneto shuts down the power, Dazzler is impaled by one of [[Lady Deathstrike]]'s claws, leaving her in a coma. Angel faces Professor Xavier and takes responsibility. Under the guise of expulsion, Angel joins [[Emma Frost#Ultimate Marvel|Emma Frost]]'s [[New Mutants#Ultimate X-Men|Academy of Tomorrow]] as a spy for Xavier.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #64–65</ref>

Warren becomes close friends with [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Ultimate Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler]], initially due to the fact that they both have physical mutations.{{issue|date=June 2012}} Warren gets over his initial attraction to [[Ultimate Storm|Storm]],{{issue|date=June 2012}} and after the events in Genosha, engages in a relationship with Dazzler.{{issue|date=June 2012}} After Bishop recruits Dazzler in his new team of X-Men, she makes Angel part of the team (despite Bishop's protests).{{issue|date=June 2012}} While trying to protect the Morlocks he is shot to death by [[Mister Sinister#Ultimate Universe|Mister Sinister]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #90</ref> Thanks to Jean Grey, he later returns to life.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #93</ref> He is seen as a member of Colossus' enhanced team, his appearance drastically altered through the use of Banshee, the Ultimate version of Mutant Growth Hormone (MGH), resulting in Warren having an eagle-like head and feathered upper torso.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #94</ref> The mutation seems to have progressed, as he is now completely feathered and has talons and double-jointed knees. During the [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]] event, Warren is brutally killed by Sabertooth.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Angel's powers include feathered wings, hollow bone structure, and zero body fat, allowing flight. He also has heightened strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, endurance, and eyesight. He does not appear to have the healing powers of his [[Earth-616|616 Universe]] counterpart.

===''X-Men: Fairy Tales''===
In the first issue of ''[[X-Men Fairy Tales]]'', based on the Japanese story of [[Momotarō]], Archangel appears as a [[pheasant]]. He refuses to fly because he is scared of falling and failing, until [[Alternative versions of Cyclops#X-Men: Fairy Tales|Cyclops]]/Hitomi and [[Alternative versions of Beast#X-Men Fairy Tales|Beast]]/Aoi convince him.

He is named Tenshi, meaning "Angel" in Japanese.

===''What If...?''===
In ''[[What If (comics)|What If]] Archangel Fell From Grace?'', Archangel is still the Angel of Death and violently murders criminals.<ref name="What If 65">''What If...?'' #65</ref> He fights Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Beast and flees after injuring Beast and Cyclops. Cameron Hodge and [[N'astirh]], Master of Demons, hold [[Candy Southern]] captive, causing Archangel to exact vengeance. He teams with N'astirh to create the door to Inferno, but sacrifices himself by merging with the demon to prevent Inferno.<ref name="What If 65" />{{Clear}}

In ''What If Angel killed X-Factor and Horsemen?'', Archangel defected back to X-Factor far more quickly than he did in canon, serving as a proactive force that acted against their enemies. However, as Apocalypse's philosophies of 'Survival of the Fittest' became more and more prominent in his mind, Warren killed not only X-Factor's enemies, but even went on to kill X-Factor and Apocalypse's Horsemen, justifying his actions by saying that his victims had proved themselves unworthy of survival by trusting him. The issue concluded with Archangel clashing with Apocalypse to determine whether he was worthy of survival, Apocalypse feeling that Archangel had gone too far as he would have judged some of Archangel's victims as worth surviving.<ref>''What If...?'' vol.2 #101</ref>

===Prelude to Deadpool Corps===
In the second issue, a universe is shown where Angel is an orphaned kid at Professor X Orphanage for troubled kids. At a dance between Professor X's and Emma Frost's orphanages, Angel teams up with kid versions of Wolverine and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] to take on the kid version of Deadpool (named Kidpool).{{Issue|date=April 2010}}
