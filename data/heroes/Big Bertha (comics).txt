==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
Created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], she first appeared in ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' vol. 2 #46 (July 1989).

==Fictional character biography==
Not a lot is known of Bertha's life before she responded to [[Mr. Immortal]]'s advertisement for a hero team, the team who would become the Great Lakes Avengers. It was revealed in the ''G.L.A.'' mini-series that Ashley is in fact a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]].<ref>''GLA: Misassembled'' #4 (Sept. 2005)</ref>

When not using her powers, Ashley is a proverbial 'big fish in a small pond', being the most famous fashion model in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], her hometown. Although offers have come her way numerous times for more prospective opportunities, she has declined them all, choosing to stay in Milwaukee with the team she considers family.

She was seen in public with the team by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], who later agreed to become their mentors.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #46</ref>  With the team, she helped Hawkeye and the [[West Coast Avengers]] against "That Which Endures."<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #48-49</ref> They also assisted Mockingbird in a holding action against [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #19</ref> After aiding the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] against the villain [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]],<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #15–17 (June–August 1998) and #25 (Apr. 1999)</ref> the team clashed with the mercenary [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Deadpool'' #10–11 (November–December 1997) and #61 (2002)</ref>

===GLA: Misassembled===
During the ''G.L.A.'' mini-series, the team took on [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] who was trying to destroy the universe. After [[Dinah Soar]]'s death, Big Bertha began to think of quitting the team to focus on her modeling career but decided to stay. She later captures Leather Boy, a rejected GLA member, who had infiltrated the team's headquarters disguised as [[Doctor Doom]] and killed Mr. Immortal and [[Squirrel Girl#Monkey Joe|Monkey Joe]], [[Squirrel Girl]]'s sidekick. During the final battle, she tried to save [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]] from being sucked into a vortex made from the device that Maelstrom created to achieve universal destruction. Fortunately, it turned out that only his clothes had been sucked off and he was merely standing at an extreme angle so he wouldn't be seen naked. After their victory, they returned to their headquarters only to find that [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] had sent a cease and desist notice ordering them to stop using the Avengers name. After discovering that they were all mutants, the team changed their name to the Great Lakes X-Men, complete with new costumes.<ref>''GLA: Misassembled'' #1–4 (2005)</ref>

===GLX-Mas Special===
During the ''GLX-Mas Special'', the team confronted Dr. Tannenbaum, who had released an army of living Christmas trees on the citizens of Wisconsin.<ref>''GLX-Mas Special'' #1</ref>

===Great Lakes Champions===
The team participated in a charity superhero poker tournament hosted by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], where Flatman beat their host in the final round. Flatman's status as champion inspired the team to rename themselves the Great Lakes Champions, after being discouraged from affiliation with both the X-Men and the Defenders by members of those teams present at the tournament, ignoring the protests of former [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions of Los Angeles]] member [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>''Thing'' vol. 2 #8 (2006)</ref>

===Civil War/The Initiative===
{{see also|Civil War (comics)}}
All of the Great Lakes Champions registered with the United States government as required by the [[Registration Acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]], as revealed when Deadpool mistakenly attempted to apprehend them for violating the Act, only to be defeated and informed that they had already registered.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #30</ref>

Big Bertha has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who are part of the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]].<ref>[https://archive.is/20120526061017/http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>

Big Bertha and her teammates became the Initiative group in charge of Wisconsin, calling themselves the Great Lakes Initiative. They were given a rescue mission to save [[Dionysus (Marvel Comics)|Dionysus]] after he fell from [[Mount Olympus]] and was captured by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], who planned to use his powers to cause mental instability on all the superheroes they consider a threat. During the task, Deadpool ambushes Mr. Immortal and Flatman. Flatman recruited him as a reserve member of the team but the mercenary eventually overstayed his welcome. In an attempt to evict Deadpool from their Initiative-sponsored headquarters, Big Bertha agrees on one date. Confusion reigns as she appears for the date in her slim form. After saving lives in a dockside all-you-can-eat restaurant, Bertha realizes that Deadpool was only attracted to her large form. She lectures him, telling of her experiences of only being valued for her looks in her slim form. In response, Deadpool removes his mask revealing his cancer-scarred face. Bertha promptly vomits in the parking lot, much to Deadpool's chagrin. Later, Squirrel Girl manages to evict Deadpool.<ref>''Deadpool GLI Summer Fun Spectacular'' #1 (2007)</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, the team confronted a [[Skrull]] disguised as [[Grasshopper (comics)|Grasshopper]], with help from [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] and Catwalk. While Mr. Immortal was shocked at the discovery, Big Bertha thought that it was ridiculously obvious.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19 (Dec. 2008)</ref> They later appeared to welcome Gravity as leader of the team, after he was transferred to Wisconsin by [[Norman Osborn]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25</ref>

===Fear Itself===
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, the team confronts [[Asbestos Man]], who takes advantage of the fear and chaos that is happening. None of the group actually wish to touch the man due to the toxicity of his suit. Mr. Immortal talks him into giving up in return for being remembered by the others.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #6</ref>

===Great Lakes Avengers (2016 series)===
In the ongoing series ''The Great Lakes Avengers'', it is revealed that the team had disbanded and gone their separate ways. Ashley had changed her name legally to Bertha for a more consistent personal brand and officially became a plus size model. She then meets Flatman and Doorman at a diner, after being informed that the GLA has been reinstated as a permanent addition to the Avengers. They relocate to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] where they meet a girl named Pansy at their new headquarters, a factory owned by Tony Stark.<ref>''The Great Lakes Avengers'' #1 (2016)</ref> The team then goes to a local bar to try to convince the owner to turn down the music. The owner, named Nain Rogue, instead refuses and begins to insult them, particularly Mr. Immortal and Bertha. Upon getting arrested after a fight, Doorman escapes leaving Flatman and Bertha to deal with a young girl named Goodness Silva who can transform into a werewolf and was attacking the police inside the station. They are later released thanks to [[Connie Ferrari]], despite the accusations of councilman Dick Snerd, who is actually Nain Rouge. Big Bertha was present when Goodness Silva was added to the Great Lakes Avengers where she takes on the name of Good Boy.<ref>''The Great Lakes Avengers'' #2 (2016)</ref> After the team discovers that Dick Snerd shut them down, Mr. Immortal returns. Bertha exits angrily and takes Doorman and Good Boy to Nain Rogue's bar to find clues. It is later revealed that Mr. Immortal and Bertha dated but broke up due to Mr. Immortal's drinking problems. After Doorman mysteriously disappears upon entering the bar, Bertha and Good Boy discover that Dick Snerd is Nain Rogue, after finding him drunk in his office.<ref>''The Great Lakes Avengers'' #3 (2016)</ref> Bertha and Good Boy take a drunken Snerd hostage and hear his backstory, or at least partially some of it. Realizing that Snerd has numerous connections and would potentially get back on the streets, Good Boy transforms and brutally assaults Snerd just as Ferrari sees the aftermath of the carnage she inflicted upon him. Later, the team drop off a gravely injured Snerd at the hospital.<ref>''The Great Lakes Avengers'' #4 (2016)</ref>

After Connie tells the team to lie low for a couple of days, Bertha goes to a modeling gig for a weight-loss product created by Dr. Nod. She then discovers that the gig was a trap set up by Dr. Nod to get a sample of her mutant DNA and use it to improve his product with Bertha's powers.<ref>''The Great Lakes Avengers'' #5 (2016)</ref> Bertha fights back, but Dr. Nod ingests much of the supplements, becoming a huge monster, and injures her. Bertha sends a text to the rest of her teammates, including Good Boy, and takes some of the supplements herself to fight Dr. Nod.<ref>''The Great Lakes Avengers'' #6 (2016)</ref> During the battle, Dr. Nod takes more of the supplements, becoming much bigger and monstrous. On Mr. Immortal's suggestion, the team performs a maneuver that has Doorman and Mr. Immortal get inside Dr. Nod's body, where Mr. Immortal manages to kill him by punching his heart. After their victory, the team is visited by Deadpool who tells them that they've been fired and can no longer use the Avengers name, leaving them confused.<ref>''The Great Lakes Avengers'' #7 (2016)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Big Bertha has the ability to make herself superhumanly strong and durable (to the point of being bulletproof) by becoming extraordinarily obese. She has suggested that her abilities are actually based on an increase and manipulation of her body mass, so that she could selectively increase the fat distribution in specific parts of her body to make them larger.{{issue|date=December 2016}} Big Bertha can also leap great distances and purge most fat from her body through vomiting to take on a slimmer appearance.<ref>''GLA: Misassembled #3</ref>

In addition to her mutant powers, Ashley is also a skilled pilot of conventional jet aircraft.

==Alternate versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
Big Bertha briefly appears in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' as a Coney Island freak show attraction.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #50</ref>

===Deadpool MAX===
In this version, Big Bertha is a prostitute who Deadpool hires for [[Bob, Agent of Hydra|Bob]]'s bachelor party, despite the fact he is not getting married. Bertha claims she does not work for a pimp because "they promote rude behavior", and ends up getting involved in Deadpool and Bob's latest misadventure when other prostitutes begin gunning after them. It's revealed that [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]] was a rival pimp who was trying to off Bertha for stealing their business. In the end Deadpool defeats Weasel and the prostitutes, but leaves Bertha to comically quarrel with another prostitute who was mocking her weight.<ref>''Deadpool MAX'' #9</ref> Later on, Weasel tricks Bertha into coming to his unlicensed medical clinic while setting Bob up under the pretense of giving him plastic surgery to avoid the authorities, as he has become the most wanted fugitive in the United States for the Cincinnati Liquid X incident; what he actually does is transfer Bertha's fat to Bob, in the hopes of ruining both their lives. Bertha, however, maintains her clientele, leaving Weasel humiliated.<ref>''Deadpool MAX II'' #3</ref>
