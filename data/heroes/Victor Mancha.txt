'''Victor Mancha''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character appeared in the award-winning series, ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''. Like the original Runaways, Victor has a supervillain for a parent; his is the classic [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] villain [[Ultron]], an evil robot bent on world domination. Victor, however, is a [[cyborg]], with human flesh and natural tissue cloned from his human mother which completely conceals his metal parts and circuitry.

==Publication history==
Victor Mancha was created by author [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and artist Adrian Alphona and debuted in ''Runaways'' vol. 2, #1 ([[2005 in comics|April 2005]]).

==Fictional character biography==
When [[Ultron]] encountered a woman named Marianella Mancha who is unable to have a child due to a drug that was put in her, Ultron took some of her DNA and cloned it while combining some of his advanced nano-technology to create for her a son named Victor Mancha.

The Runaways first heard of Victor Mancha as a boy who would grow up to become the villain "Victorious", a man who would rule the world after dismantling the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  Due to his prophesied betrayal, Victor was kept under close surveillance when he first joined the team, but has since been accepted as a full-fledged member. He is the team's only [[Latino]] member and one of two members who can pilot the [[Leapfrog (comics)|Leapfrog]], the Runaways' mode of transportation.

===True Believers===
Victor is first introduced as the son of [[Mexicans|Mexican]] single mother Marianella Mancha, supposed widow of a [[United States Marine Corps]] member who was [[killed in action]].<ref name="debut">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian K.

When an older version of [[Gertrude Yorkes]] arrives in the present, she informs the Runaways of a villain in her time named "Victorious", and how they must stop him right now while he is still a teen. It is at this point she dies, but the Runaways decide to comply with her wish.<ref name="debut"/> After the Runaways track Victor down at his school, the sight of [[Karolina Dean]] activates Victor's electromagnetic superpowers - it would later be revealed that Victor's powers would manifest only when he came in contact with another superhero, hence Karolina.<ref name="runawaysvol2#6">{{cite web|url=http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&fldAuto=333|title=Runaways (2nd series) #6|first=Fantomex|date=2008-07-31|publisher=Merging Minds|accessdate=2009-03-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008004313/http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&fldAuto=333|archivedate=2008-10-08|df=}}</ref>

Remembering how future-Gert mentioned that Victorious's father was the "greatest evil in all the universe", the Runaways sift through possibilities such as [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], [[Red Skull]], [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], and [[Galactus (comics)|Galactus]].<ref name="runawaysvol2#4">{{cite web|url=http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&fldAuto=331|title=Runaways (2nd series) #4|first=Fantomex|date=2008-07-29|publisher=Merging Minds|accessdate=2009-03-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008004255/http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&fldAuto=331|archivedate=2008-10-08|df=}}</ref> Although [[Doctor Doom]] calls Victor proclaiming he is his father, it turns out that it is merely a Doombot created by Ultron. Victor discovers that his actual "father" is Ultron who created Victor as a [[sleeper agent]] for the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Victor was meant to grow up, travel to New York and meet the Avengers. After years of loyal service, he would have access to their most guarded secrets, and then Ultron would have taken over and destroyed every hero on the planet. The Runaways foiled this plan, but Victor still fears this future may come true.<ref name="runawaysvol2#6"/> Ultron kills Marianella and overrides Victor's circuits, forcing him to attack the Runaways. With help from [[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]], the Runaways and Victor defeat Ultron, but they take Victor in after realizing that Victor is in the same boat as they are.<ref name="runawaysvol2#6"/>

===Runaways===
Over the next few months, Victor proves himself to the team, particularly to [[Chase Stein]], in battle to make up for his alternate future self. He falls out of grace for a short while after [[Nico Minoru]] discovers that the second [[Pride (comics)|Pride]] has tapped into Victor's circuits and was using him to spy on the team.

After the Runaways' fight with the new 
Pride, Victor begins a physical relationship with Nico; he confesses to have initiated it because he harbors romantic feelings for her, but Nico claims to have participated as a way to escape her [[survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]] regarding the death of [[Gertrude Yorkes]]. However, Victor still attempts a rescue when he discovers Chase has Nico hostage, but is easily shut down when Chase asks him a rhetorical question designed to overload Victor's circuits.  Victor recovers with help from [[Molly Hayes]] (vicariously by [[Alex Wilder]]) and saves Nico from becoming an innocent sacrifice to the [[Gibborim (comics)|Gibborim]]. At this point, Victor and Nico begin a romantic relationship, but their moment of bliss is interrupted when the team is forced to run from [[Iron Man]] and the pro-registration forces of Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].<ref>''Runaways (vol.2)'' #24</ref>

===Civil War===
During a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operation to capture the Runaways, Victor uses his powers to shield the [[Leapfrog (comics)|Leapfrog]] from a barrage of missiles.  The second wave of missiles are coated with [[Teflon]], so they are unaffected by Victor's magnetic powers and hit him.  He suffers grievous damage and the team returns with him to the Hostel.  Victor then experiences intense seizures when the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] arrives with the [[Young Avengers]].<ref>''Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways'' #1</ref>

Although the Runaways are initially mistrustful of the Young Avengers, [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]] is able to pull the Vision away from Victor. The Vision explains that he and Victor were experiencing a form of feedback caused by their shared programming because both of them were created by [[Ultron]].<ref>''Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways'' #4</ref>

Nico and Victor also initiate a relationship.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Victor's assortment of humorous nicknames is a sort of [[running gag]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} in the series' second volume, with such names as "Static Cling Lad", "[[Mr. Roboto]]", "Victron", "Calculator Kid", "Señor Cyborg", "[[Man of La Mancha]]", RoboPinnochio, and Magnet Man."

===Dead-End Kids===
After escaping [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Nico makes a decision to make a deal with [[Kingpin (comics)|the Kingpin]], which disgusts Victor.<ref name="runv2#25">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Joss Whedon]] | Penciller =  [[Michael Ryan (artist)|Michael Ryan]] | Inker = [[Christina Strain]] | Story = Dead-End Kids | Title = Runaways | Volume = 2 | Issue = 25 | Date = April 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> In a twisted turn of events, the Runaways end up time-displaced in 1907 New York.<ref name="deadendkids">{{cite web|url=http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&fldAuto=440|title=Dead End Kids|first=Fantomex|publisher=Merging Minds|accessdate=2009-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518084321/http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&fldAuto=440|archivedate=2009-05-18|df=}}</ref> It is during this period where Victor meets Lillie "the Spieler" McGurty, a girl who can fly to the sound of music. While separated from Nico, Victor bonds with Lillie's carefree spirit. A short time later, he has a dream of kissing Lillie. Nico, understanding her relationship with Victor is deteriorating, backs off allowing Victor to initiate a relationship with Lillie, who agreed to return to the present with the Runaways. Right before the Runaways boarded the time machine taking them home, Lillie changes her mind and decides to stay instead, due to fear of jumping into the future. [[Klara Prast]] takes her place instead, arriving with the Runaways in the present. Although the Runaways do not know, Lillie is still alive, regretting her decision.<ref name="deadendkids"/>

After using the Vibranium in a special piano given to Vision by [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], Victor misjudges the strength of his powers and accidentally kills Vision's son, Vin.<ref>''Vision'' #9</ref> Captain America arrests him, but Vision defeats the Avengers to reach his cell.

===Becoming Victorious===
When [[Chase Stein]] attempts to revive Victor's head, the "Victorious" program begins.<ref>''Runaways'' Vol. 4 #3</ref> It is revealed that Victor is conscious when [[Chase Stein]], [[Nico Minoru]], [[Gertrude Yorkes]], and [[Old Lace (comics)|Old Lace]] visits [[Molly Hayes]] to see if she is interested in reforming the Runaways again. During this visit, Molly is the only one to figure out that he is conscious and happy that Victor is still alive in a sense. Victor asks Molly to keep this a secret as he figures out whether or not he wants to rejoin Chase and the others. But unknown to the Runaways, Molly's grandmother plucked a strand of hair from Victor's head with unclear intentions. <ref>''Runaways'' Vol. 4 #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Victor Mancha is a [[cyborg]], created from the [[DNA]] of Marianella Mancha and the technology of Ultron. Victor was constructed using advanced [[Nanorobotics|nanite]] technology that will evolve and mature with Victor into adulthood so that his robotic innards will transform into artificial human organs, indistinguishable from real ones.  Ultron created Victor with several computer-related abilities, including a high level of intelligence, vast amounts of [[hard drive]] memory (which Victor refers to as [[photographic memory]]), and the ability to communicate with other machines directly.  Victor also possesses some level of superhuman strength, incredible speed, a powerful jumping ability, and an automated self-repair function.

In combat, Victor primarily employs his electromagnetic abilities; he is capable of directing high voltage electrical energy from his hands and manipulating magnetic fields to reshape and bend metallic objects.  Much like [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Victor can use Earth's natural magnetic lines of force to levitate and fly.

Despite his array of powers, Victor has four known weaknesses, many of which stem from his mechanical roots.  At his current age, Victor's nanites have not yet fully transformed into human organs, so his entire body will set off metal detectors, potentially drawing him unwanted attention.  Second, Victor's mainframe can be [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]] and controlled remotely; "Hunter" (of the second Pride) (Victor removed it with an internal firewall) and Ultron are the only two that have successfully hacked Victor thus far.  Victor discovered his third weakness during the Runaways' first encounter with the [[Young Avengers]], when he and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] both short-circuited upon getting too close to each other.  The Runaways and Young Avengers eventually discovered that when any two of Ultron's creations come within a close vicinity, both create a devastating feedback, harming both machines. This weakness has apparently since been removed, as Victor has been shown interacting with the Vision's new family without any harm to either.

While decoding The Abstract, Chase discovered Victor's last and most potent weakness: three questions designed specifically to overload Victor's circuits and lock him into a never ending loop of meaningless [[binary numeral system|binary]], which Nico refers to as "[[blue screen of death|the blue screen of death]]."  Chase used the first phrase against Victor after the cyborg discovered Nico in chains: "[[Omnipotence paradox|Could God make a sandwich so big that even He couldn't finish it?]]"  The only way for Victor to recover from his shutdown mode is by hearing the question's answer from someone else.  Once Victor's mainframe becomes functional again, he cannot be affected by that specific phrase ever again.  The two other phrases are unrevealed as yet, and are known only to Chase and Nico.

==Other versions==
===What If?===
In ''What If the Runaways became the Young Avengers?'', Victor is first contacted by his future self of Victorious after Victorious traveled back from the future with [[Iron Lad]], who accidentally landed in Victorious's time while attempting to escape [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Victor and Victorious steal the Iron Lad armor and Victor pretends to be Iron Lad. He then recruits the Runaways forcing them to be an actual superhero team with costumes, but intends to kill them. When Kang appears to rescue his younger self, the subsequent fight results in Iron Lad being killed and Kang being erased from history while Victor destroys his future self rejecting his evil ways. Having averted his destiny, Victor then departs via Kang's time-belt to find his own way, leaving the Runaways to continue as Young Avengers with Chase now using parts of the Iron Lad armor.<ref>What if the Runaways became the Young Avengers?</ref>

===Age of Ultron===
During the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, Victor Mancha was bringing some children to one of the Runaways' old bases in Los Angeles. Victor is having a hard time because he believes that if he uses his machine abilities, he will just help Ultron’s victory. He does not tell any of his new found friends about his background because he is afraid they will not accept him. In a flashback, it is shown that his Runaways teammates were all killed by Ultron and that Victor had stored digital versions of them in his memory banks, but these files seem to be corrupted since they seem to telling him that he needs to become more machine and less human. The Ultron Sentinels find the hideout and start killing some of the kids that Victor had saved. Victor decides to fight the Ultron Sentinels while determining that if this is the end, he will go down fighting.<ref>''Ultron'' #1AU</ref>

===Avengers A.I.===
In one alternate future, [[Alexis The Protector|Alexis]] has a vision of 12,000 A.D. in which rogue A.I. Dimitrios wiped out humanity, the Kree, the Skrulls, and the Inhumans and traps all mutants in a pocket dimension. Only the Avengers A.I. survive, led by Alexis. Victor in this future wields [[Ultimate Thor|Ultimate Thor's]] hammer and joins the surviving Avengers in attacking Dimitrios, who created a spaceship out of [[Galactus]]'s carcass. He is killed by Dimitrios and [[Doombot]] then sacrifices himself, since Victor was the only person he considered a "Pal".<ref>''Avengers A.I. Issue 10-11</ref>

==Conceptual origins==
On colorist Christina Strain's Live Journal, she revealed that Victor's eyes are green with a golden center, which was modeled after [[Gael García Bernal]].<ref name="dearworld">{{cite web|url=http://color-me-sleepy.livejournal.com/125355.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121205215254/http://color-me-sleepy.livejournal.com/125355.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-05 |title=Dear World. |last=Strain |first=Christina |date=2008-08-08 |publisher=LiveJournal |accessdate=2009-03-04 }}</ref>
