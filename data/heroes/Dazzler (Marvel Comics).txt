'''Dazzler''' ('''Alison Blaire''') is a fictional [[superhero]]ine appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually associated with the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #130 (February [[1980 in comics|1980]]).

A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams, Dazzler was originally developed as a cross-promotional, multi-media creation between [[Casablanca Records]] and [[Marvel Comics]] until the tie-ins were dropped in 1980. The character was created by a [[design by committee|committee]] of Marvel staff, principally writer/editor [[Tom DeFalco]] and illustrator [[John Romita Jr.]]

Despite the fact that Dazzler was originally commissioned as a [[disco]] singer, the character shifted to other musical genres, including [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]]. She starred in a self-titled solo series in the early [[1980s in comics|1980s]] which lasted forty-two issues, a [[Marvel Graphic Novel]] titled ''Dazzler: The Movie'', a four-issue limited series co-starring [[Beast (comics)|The Beast]] titled ''Beauty and the Beast'', and later joined the cast of the [[X-Men]]. She was briefly a member of the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] group [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] but has since re-joined the X-Men.

==Publication history==

===Origins of ''Dazzler''===
[[Image:Debut of Dazzler.jpg|200px|left|thumb|First appearance of the Dazzler]]
''Dazzler'' was originally a project commissioned by [[Casablanca Records]] in the mid-to-late [[1970s in comics|1970s]] to be a cross-promotion in the mold of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], who had two successful comic book tie-in super-specials by the end of 1977. Marvel Comics would develop a singing superhero, while Casablanca would produce a singer. The two companies would then work with Filmworks and produce a tie-in motion picture; Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief [[Jim Shooter]] wrote a treatment for the project.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/26/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-161/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #161], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 26, 2008</ref>

Romita, Jr. originally intended for the character to resemble model, actress, and singer [[Grace Jones]],<ref name="twomorrows.com">{{cite web|url=http://twomorrows.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=661|title=Modern Masters Volume 18: John Romita Jr : TwoMorrows Publishing, The Future of Comics and LEGO™ Publications.|first=The Zen Cart® Team and|last=others|website=twomorrows.com}}</ref> but representatives from Filmworks &ndash; wanting to promote model and actress [[Bo Derek]] &ndash; insisted on design changes to reflect Derek's features.<ref name="twomorrows.com"/>{{failed verification|reason=Does this actually come from the book being sold by that website?

===''Dazzler'': 1981-1985===
Dazzler guest starred in Marvel titles, such as ''The Uncanny X-Men'', ''The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', the ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'', and the Marvel crossover, ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]''.

John Romita, Jr. left ''Dazzler'' in issue #3, and was replaced by [[Frank Springer]], who penciled most of the ''Dazzler'' series. DeFalco stayed on as chief writer through issue #6, and helped successive writer Danny Fingeroth with several of the following issues. Fingeroth and Springer remained the ''Dazzler'' stable team through issue #27.

With issue #25, ''Dazzler'' became a bi-monthly publication. Springer changed Dazzler from a singer in New York to an aspiring actress in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. To promote this new direction, Marvel had artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] do painted artwork pieces for several ''Dazzler'' covers, from issues #27 through #35. Springer left ''Dazzler'' with issue #32, and returned briefly for issue #35 and the ''Dazzler: The Movie'' graphic novel.

[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and [[Paul Chadwick]] were assigned to ''Dazzler'' with issue #38, but the series was canceled in 1985. After that, she was briefly considered as a possible ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' founding member, but the decision to resurrect [[Jean Grey]] put that idea aside.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncannyxmen.net/secrets-behind-the-x-men/jean-greys-return-in-x-factor|title=Jean Grey's return in X-Factor - uncannyxmen.net|website=www.uncannyxmen.net}}</ref>

===X-Men===
After this, the character went on to a notable run as an X-Men member, before disappearing completely for much of the 1990s and early 2000s, barring occasional cameos. With the launch of ''[[Excalibur (comics)|New Excalibur]]'', she returned to monthly publication for the first time as a prominent cast member in over fifteen years. When Marvel canceled ''New Excalibur'', Dazzler was brought back as a supporting character in Uncanny X-Men written by [[Matt Fraction]]. In February 2010, Marvel published a one-shot ''Dazzler'' special by writer [[Jim McCann (writer)|Jim McCann]] and artist Kalman Andrasofszky.<ref>{{cite web | author= Richards, Dave| date=2010-02-08| title=MCCANN MAKES DAZZLER SING ONCE MORE | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24753| accessdate=2010-03-19}}</ref> The 2012 series ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' features Dazzler as the leader of a dimension-hopping X-Men team. Dazzler appeared in the 2012 volume of ''Uncanny X-Men'' as an agent of superspy outfit S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Issue 6. May 2013. Marvel Comics</ref>

===A-Force===
Beginning in May 2015, Dazzler appears as one of the main characters in ''[[A-Force]]'', an all-female [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] launched by [[G. Willow Wilson]], Marguerite Bennett, and Jorge Molina during Marvel's "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline.<ref name="Mashable">{{cite web |last=Dickey |first=Josh |date=2015-02-06 |title=Marvel assembles first all-female Avengers team, the 'A-Force'|url=http://mashable.com/2015/02/06/marvel-female-avengers-a-force/|publisher=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=2015-02-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/02/06/marvel-comics-a-force-female-avengers/22970157/|title=Female Avengers team comes to the fore with 'A-Force'|publisher=}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Uncanny130.jpg|Dazzler's first appearance. Cover for Uncanny X-Men #130 by John Romita Jr., interiors by John Byrne (1980).|150px|thumb|left]] -->
Alison Blaire was born in Gardendale, New York to Carter Blaire and Katherine Blaire. Her [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers first manifest when she is in junior high school. An aspiring singer, she volunteers to perform at her school dance when her light-generating abilities first appear. Everyone at the dance assumes it is a technologically generated [[special effect]], an assumption commonly made before she reveals herself to be a mutant later in her life.

Using the [[stage name]] "Dazzler", Alison sets out to make a name for herself in the [[music industry]], using her light powers and dancing ability to enhance her performances. It is at one of her shows that Alison first meets the [[X-Men]] while they are attacked by the forces of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Angry at the interruption of her show, Alison lashes out in anger at the Hellfire intruders, unintentionally making one member [[catatonic]]. Alison subsequently aids the X-Men in finding [[Kitty Pryde]]. She has always assumed that life as a disco queen would be exciting but finds the fight with the X-Men's enemies going a bit too far. Thus she turns down their offer to join the team.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #130-131</ref>

Dazzler hides her status as a mutant from all but those closest to her. After acquainting herself with the various [[Marvel Comics]] superheroes, Alison finds herself continually using her abilities to fight both ordinary criminals and rogue superhumans—often at the expense of her career ambitions. On one occasion, she meets [[Spider-Man]], teaming up against the [[Lightmaster]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #203</ref> She later battles the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]],<ref>''Dazzler'' #1-2</ref> is overwhelmed by [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Absorbing Man]] and then fights off [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]].<ref>''Dazzler'' #3-4</ref> She briefly allies with the [[Blue Shield (comics)|Blue Shield]],<ref>''Dazzler'' #5</ref> and aids the X-Men and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] against the misguided [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]].<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #148">''Uncanny X-Men'' #148</ref> On another occasion, she battles and defeats the [[Hulk]],<ref>''Dazzler'' #6-7</ref> and establishes a long-standing feud with the then-mentally unstable [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]].<ref>''Dazzler'' #22-23</ref> She also has a romantic affair with [[Warren Worthington III]].<ref>''Dazzler'' # 17-28</ref>
In the course of her inadvertent adventures, she even encounters the planet-devouring [[Galactus]], who initially thinks she is of little notice and generally ignores her. Nevertheless, Galactus temporarily endows her with cosmic energy so she can retrieve the herald [[Terrax]].<ref name="Dazzler #10">''Dazzler'' #10</ref> In addition to being offered membership into the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' v.1 #131</ref> Alison is also asked to audition for a place in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. She declines while facing [[Fabian Stankowicz]] (who is ultimately easily defeated by the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]), saying that the superhero "trip wasn't for [her]".<ref>''Avengers'' v.1 #221</ref>

Dazzler moves to Los Angeles in a vain attempt to help her half-sister [[Lois London]], who has the mutant power to kill anyone with a touch, but has little to no control over the ability.<ref>''Dazzler'' v. 1 #26-27</ref> While in Los Angeles, Alison attempts careers in [[Physical fitness|fitness]] training, [[dance|dancing]], [[model (person)|modeling]], and [[acting]]. Influenced both by her lover Roman Nekoboh, and her desire to abate the growing anti-mutant sentiment, Alison publicly declares her mutant identity. The revelation backfires, destroying her reputation and career and inflaming anti-mutant sentiment, which sends Alison into a depressive state.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel #12: Dazzler: The Movie''</ref> Forced again into hiding, she spends some time as a keyboard player and back-up vocalist in rock singer and fellow mutant [[Lila Cheney]]'s band.<ref>''New Mutants'' v. 1 #29</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' v.1 #214</ref> While on tour, the band's plane crashes, which leads to Dazzler, Lila, and a bandmate being successfully rescued by [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] and [[Icarus (comics)|Joshua]]. Lila has been knocked out so Dazzler uses the music Joshua plays at the scene to blast a hole through the wreckage.<ref>''New Mutants'' v.1 #42</ref> Alison is later possessed by the psychic mutant [[Malice (comics)|Malice]]; after an encounter with the [[X-Men]] coming to warn her about the Marauders, Dazzler is freed from possession and becomes a member of the team.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' v. 1 #214</ref>

During her tenure with the X-Men, Dazzler receives training, attains greater control over her powers, and develops a romance with the extra-dimensional [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' v. 1 #214-247</ref> She is also forced to work alongside the now-reformed Rogue. This causes considerable tension between them at first, due to Alison's difficulty in getting over Rogue's attempts to kill her in the past, as well as Rogue's own strong feelings for Longshot. Over time, Alison eventually believes Rogue is genuinely remorseful and forgives her teammate.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' v. 1 #221-222</ref> Dazzler struggles with her career ambitions and personal insecurities, and eventually she and her teammates in the X-Men enter the mystical [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' v. 1 #248</ref> Discovered in an amnesiac state washed up on a beach by her former bodyguard [[Strong Guy|Guido]], she is nursed back to health by Guido and Lila, though their efforts prove unsuccessful in helping restore her memory.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' v. 1 #260</ref> Her memory is eventually restored when she is found by Longshot.<ref>''X-Men'' v. 2 #5</ref> Devastated by the loss of her career, Alison ventures to Longshot's native "Mojoworld", and remains there to help fight in the ongoing rebellion against the tyrant [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] along with Lila.<ref>''X-Men'' v. 2 #11</ref>

Dazzler eventually returns to Earth without Longshot after an unfortunate series of events, including an apparent miscarriage<ref>''X-Men'' v. 2 #47</ref> and war.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' v. 1 #393</ref> She helps [[Jean Grey]] in the fight against a repowered [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] backed by an army of [[Genosha]]ns. She and Jean lead a small band of mutants to back up the original X-Men that are in Genosha already. Dazzler faces down Magneto, who turns her powers against her and apparently incinerates her. As Magneto arrogantly boasts about this triumph, Dazzler reveals herself to be alive and well. She and Jean had concocted a plan for Alison to generate a hard-light hologram of herself to distract Magneto, then gravely wounded by Wolverine. After the conclusion of this incident, the X-Men offer Alison support for her personal problems, but she declines.<ref>''X-Men'' v. 2 #113</ref>

Characters in the Marvel Universe who are counted among her fans are [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #217</ref> teammate [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]],<ref>''Dazzler'' #38</ref> the Hulk,<ref>''Dazzler'' #6</ref> [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #392</ref> the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]],<ref>''Deadpool'' #67</ref> [[Molly Hayes]],<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #19</ref> Shadowcat,<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #148"/> and [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]].<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #500">''Uncanny X-Men'' #500</ref>

Dazzler later re-establishes her musical career, marketing her trademark disco image as part of the [[Trance music|Techno/Trance]] genre. Alison moves her career abroad to England and joins with X-Men allies such as the Juggernaut and [[Captain Britain]].<ref>''New Excalibur'' #1</ref> She is reunited with [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]] in the ''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' miniseries, although Longshot is suffering from [[amnesia]] and does not remember her. However, during the course of the miniseries he regains his feelings for her and some of his memories.<ref>''X-Men: Die by the Sword'' #4-5</ref> Longshot leaves the Exiles to reestablish a relationship with Dazzler but the couple splits ways due in part to Dazzler's frustration with other women's attraction to Longshot, but mainly because of the realization that Longshot is no longer the man she loved because of his amnesia.<ref name="X-Factor35">''X-Factor'' vol. 5 #35</ref>

While Psylocke gains the upper hand, Dazzler points out that Storm blew out all the windows when they entered. This was so she could absorb all the sound from the city outside, which she turned into a beam of light that burns the right side of Psylocke's face off. After the Sisterhood retreats, Dazzler is happily reunited with Psylocke regaining control of her Japanese body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #511</ref>

===X-Men: Second Coming===
Dazzler, along with [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], Northstar, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], Pixie and [[Trance (comics)|Trance]] travel to Limbo to rescue [[Magik (comics)|Magik]]. Things go wrong when the ground starts to tremble and an army of monstrous demons attack the team. Dazzler calls upon Gambit for help during the attack, but Gambit sinks into the darkness, claiming "Remy's not home right now" leading the X-Men to be overwhelmed by the demons.<ref>''X-Men: Hellbound'' #1</ref> Dazzler ends up alone and is rescued by Northstar just as she is about to lose her fight against the demons. Northstar and Dazzler encounter Gambit shortly after, unfortunately Gambit has reverted to the Death persona, seemingly attacking Northstar who easily evades Gambit's cards. Northstar avoids the attack, realizing the cards were meant for Dazzler and she is transformed into a state much like Gambit's Death persona. Northstar was infected soon after. Dazzler, infected by Gambit (now completely consumed by the concept of survival of the fittest), joins to infect the other X-Men in Limbo as well.<ref>''X-Men: Hellbound'' #2</ref> Dazzler and Northstar were soon freed thanks to Magik's Soulsword.<ref>''X-Men: Hellbound'' #3</ref>

===Regenesis===
During the Schism between [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Dazzler chooses to remain in San Francisco with Cyclops's side. Dazzler is then asked to lead a "Street Team" of X-Men, to which she agrees.<ref>''X-Men: Regenesis''</ref> Although never seen, she was paired with [[Boom Boom (comics)|Boom Boom]] and [[Lifeguard (comics)|Lifeguard]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men vol. 2' #1</ref>

===X-Treme X-Men===
Dazzler is later summoned to Utopia to help Cyclops and Danger with a Ghost Box. When the Ghost Box is opened, several alternate reality [[X-Treme X-Men|X-Men]] are seen fighting an evil version of [[Professor X]].<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'', Volume 2 #1</ref> When Dazzler tries to help them, she gets sucked through a portal and is whisked away from Earth-616, narrowly avoiding the events of ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]''.

===X-Factor===
In "The End of X-Factor" storyline, the conclusion of the X-Factor team with whom Dazzler had not previously had contact, [[Shatterstar]] and [[Rictor]] encounter a past-version of Dazzler while time-traveling through Mojoworld. At this point in her life, Dazzler and Longshot are still married and active in the revolt against Mojo. Rictor discovers Dazzler just as she is about to give birth to the child that had been believed to result in a miscarriage. The surviving infant was revealed to be Shatterstar, resolving nearly two decades of speculation that Shatterstar actually was the biological child of Dazzler and Longshot. Exhausted from her ordeal, Dazzler passes out, and Shatterstar reveals the necessity of wiping both her and Longshot's memories of the event, presumably to be replaced with memory of the miscarriage that Dazzler had referenced in the past, and taking his infant self a century into Mojoworld's future, to be raised as a warrior away from his birth parents.<ref>''X-Factor'' #259</ref>

===Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.===
In an attempt to better understand the mutant community and Cyclops's talk of mutant revolution, [[Maria Hill]] personally asks Dazzler to become an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], a proposition Alison accepts.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men vol. 3'' #6</ref> After her first encounter with Cyclops's X-Men team, Dazzler is poisoned and replaced by the shapeshifter [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #9</ref> Dazzler is rescued by Magneto and she was told how she was kidnapped and put in a coma-like state so that Mystique could use her to generate Mutant Growth Hormone; afterwards she joins Cyclops's Uncanny X-Men team with a new darker [[Goth subculture|Goth]] appearance.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men, Volume 3'' #24</ref>

===A-Force===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, [[A-Force]], the defenders of the matriarchal [[Battleworld]] nation of Arcadia, responds to a [[megalodon]] attack while on routine patrol. During the attack, [[Miss America (America Chavez)|America Chavez]] throws the shark across the Shield, the wall that separates their borders, thus breaking the laws of [[Doctor Doom|Emperor Doom]] and is subsequently arrested by Doom's enforcers, the Thor Corps. Despite appeals from [[She-Hulk]], the baroness of Arcadia, Chavez is sentenced to spend the rest of her life on the wall. In response, She-Hulk tasks the Sub-Mariners - [[Namor]], [[Namorita]], and [[Namora]] - to find the source of the megalodon attack. Meanwhile, Nico, lamenting the loss of Chavez, comes across a mysterious figure that fell out of the sky. The Sub-Mariners discover a strange portal in the ocean's depths but it implodes as they draw near. Later, at the behest of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], Minoru introduces her new friend to She-Hulk. When [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] accuses the stranger, a sentient [[pocket universe]], of creating the portal, a [[Sentinel (comics)|sentinel]] falls from another portal and attacks the team. During the fight, the newcomer saves Dazzler and convinces She-Hulk that she is not the cause. After destroying the sentinel, She-Hulk decides to travel through the still open portal and investigate the source herself. She-Hulk arrives in a post-apocalyptic Manhattan and after a brief encounter with more sentinels, she is chased back to Arcadia by the Thor Corps. The Thor Corps follow in pursuit, but Medusa manages to repel them back into the portal and is killed in the process. When the Thor Corps return, She-Hulk alerts the citizens of Arcadia that there is a traitor in their midst that is spreading discontent and vows to bring them to justice as she and other A-Forcers go into hiding inside the newcomer. The newcomer smuggles A-Force outside the city. There, She-Hulk realizes that the portals' energy is of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] origin and they deduce that the traitor is Loki. With A-Force outlawed, Loki is set to be crowned the new baroness of Arcadia but is preemptively attacked by A-Force. After Loki is defeated, she releases a final blast of energy that breaches the Shield thus allowing the [[Marvel Zombies|zombie horde]] on the other side to enter. As the horde approaches, She-Hulk rallies A-Force, the Thor Corps and other heroes in defense of Arcadia. During the fight, the zombies begin to overwhelm the city but the newcomer – now named Singularity – absorbs the entire horde, sacrificing herself in the process. In the aftermath of the battle, the Thor Corps arrests Loki as A-Force begins reconstruction of Arcadia. Meanwhile, She-Hulk comforts Minoru, who is still mourning the loss of her friends, telling her that she believes Singularity lives on.<ref>''A-Force'' Vol. 1 #1-5</ref>

After the ''Secret Wars'' storyline, while participating in a roller derby in Miami, Dazzler is approached by Singularity, [[She-Hulk]], [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]], [[Nico Minoru]] and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] to help them defeat Antimatter, since they required a powerful light source to defeat their foe. When Antimatter appeared it became apparent that even with Dazzler's help they couldn't defeat him so Singularity teleported everyone to Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station where Dr. Tempest Bell theorized that killing Antimatter would also kill Singularity due to their connection via a quantum entanglement. A-Force attempted to negotiate with Antimatter but he explained he sought to understand humanity by disassembling their molecules and finding a use for them. This led to a fight in which Dazzler was critically injured and died on the operating table. Dazzler woke up following the failed operation to realize it seemed like she was unable to die. Dazzler rejoined the fight against Antimatter in time to take Singularity into a pocket dimension to protect her from dying when Antimatter was destroyed. Singularity sensed something else had broken through into their universe and as they set off Nico gave herself and Dazzler a magic makeover. Teleporting to Astoria, Oregon they found the dimension-hoppers were [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)#Dazzler Thor|Dazzler Thor]] - an alternate version of Dazzler from [[Battleworld]] - and her opponent, a gigantic dragon who is actually a reality warping woman called Countess. The Countess vanished following her defeat and A-Force took Dazzler Thor to get "ale" and Nico convinces Dazzler to talk to Dazzler Thor. Dazzler revealed to her alternate self that she had accidentally come into contact with [[Terrigen Mist]] and contracted M-Pox which sterilizes and kills [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. Dazzler Thor was the first person she told and even then Dazzler didn't know what it meant since it seemed her powers now included being unable to die. Dazzler woke up alongside the rest of A-Force and Dazzler Thor in a jail cell without any powers. Nico appeared under the mind control of the Countess who'd changed into the form of a woman and commanded Nico to strip A-Force of their powers. Dazzler Thor tries to call her hammer - Light Bringer - but Nico makes her unworthy with a spell. Without her god-like powers, Dazzler Thor also began falling victim to M-Pox. When A-Force annoyed the Countess, Nico was made to send She-Hulk into a murderous rage, but they used this to break the wall and escape. After surviving a spell Nico was forced to make that was meant to drown them, A-Force attacked the Countess during which Dazzler created a hologram of Nico so Medusa could sneak her away from the Countess' influence. Dazzler Thor used a hologram to get close to the Countess. But the Countess attacked and injured her, but Dazzler picked up Light Bringer to defend her. Once the fight was over, Dazzler Thor succumbed to the M-Pox virus and died in a flash of light. Dazzler revealed to the rest of A-Force she also had the lethal disease and left behind Light Bringer in respect for her fallen alternate self.<ref>''A-Force'' Vol. 2 #2-7</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Dazzler went with Captain Marvel to fight [[Thanos]], who the Inhuman Ulysses had predicted would appear. Although Thanos was defeated, She-Hulk was seriously injured. Shortly afterwards, Ulysses predicted that Nico would murder an innocent woman named Alice. Captain Marvel wanted to arrest Nico before this could happen. Dazzler disagreed with Captain Marvel, saying that although she agreed with Tony Stark's view that they shouldn't arresting people for crimes that they might commit she only stood by Carol because she was her friend. When Nico arrives Captain Marvel tries to explain about the vision before Dazzler warns Nico that she's going to get arrested. Nico escapes and Captain Marvel blames Dazzler, who tells her if they could really predict they future they should have known it would happen. Dazzler and Singularity opposed Captain Marvel and Medusa's decision to hunt down and capture Nico. Dazzler and Singularity follow Marvel and Medusa to Arizona, Colorado where Nico is hiding with [[Elsa Bloodstone]] and find it overrun by an infection turning people into a swarm of giant bugs. After a brief confrontation when the rest of A-Force find Nico they split into two teams: one to find Alice and the other to protect the civilians. Dazzler, Singularity and Medusa protect civilians despite their disagreement. While searching for Alice in an abandoned mine, Danvers, Minoru and Bloodstone are attacked by a giant bug. The bug incapacitates Danvers and Bloodstone before telepathically communicating to Minoru that she is Alice and has been inadvertently infecting the townspeople after her transformation. Alice tells Minoru that killing her is the only way to save the people. When Minoru refuses, an infected Bloodstone threatens to kill Danvers. Medusa, Singularity, and an infected Dazzler are overrun by bugs and regroup with the others just as Bloodstone infects Danvers. After Dazzler infects Medusa, Minoru casts a spell to transform Alice back into a human but it does not cure the rest of the populace. Alice explains that she must be killed and Minoru reluctantly casts a death spell on Alice which transforms the infected back into humans. Alice then remerges in her final form and tells A-Force that she is no longer a threat as she now has greater control of her powers.<ref>''A-Force'' Vol. 2 #8-10</ref>

=== Inhumans vs X-Men ===
During the [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|Inhumans vs X-Men]] storyline, Dazzler assisted Emma Frost in the beginning of her plot to defeat the Inhumans. She disguised herself as an Inhuman performer shortly before ambushing [[Black Bolt]] in his own Quiet Room.<ref>''Inhumans vs X-Men'' #1</ref> Dazzler was seen again at the end of the storyline, sitting in a reserved chair before a fire.<ref>''Inhumans vs X-Men'' #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Dazzler is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to transduce sonic vibrations which reach her body into various types of light. This ability seems to operate over a great range of frequencies, including the audible spectrum, and a great variation of sound pressure levels regardless of the complexity, dissonance, or randomness of the sound.  Sounds as different as a car crash and a symphonic passage both produce convertible incoming acoustic vibrations.

Dazzler prefers utilizing the sound of music, particularly that which is rhythmically sustained. Not only is music more pleasant to her ears, but the steady beat of contemporary music provides a more constant source of sound to convert. The precise means by which this conversion process works is as yet unknown. Dazzler has been shown to create a "null space" of sound in a certain radius of her person, as a result of "pulling" the sound in her area to her person, to either protect a crowd of people or to supercharge her power reserves.<ref>''Dazzler: The Movie'' Marvel Graphic Novel #12</ref>

Left undirected, Dazzler's light will radiate from her body in all directions, producing regular flashes of white light. By conscious control over the light she produces, she can control its direction, frequency (color), amplitude (intensity), and duration.

Dazzler can produce numerous effects. She can create simple patterns out of rays of light or combinations of patterns which produce trance-like effects in her targets. She can create a pulse of light on the order of several thousand [[watt]]s of power, which temporarily blinds people with its brilliance. She can create a chaotic cascade of sparkling lights and colors that severely upsets other people's equilibrium, or a pulsating strobe-light effect. Dazzler can generate a coherent beam of light, approximating a laser beam. Dazzler can generate a shield from laser energy that can deflect projectiles or energy beams.

Dazzler has polarizing eyes and cannot be blinded or dazzled by light.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol. 2 #3</ref>

With effort, she can create holograms of human beings and other three-dimensional beings and objects. She can also use light energy to generate flight.

She generally directs lasers from a single finger when she requires precision. She most often uses her hands for directing her light effects, but she could also use other parts of her body. Since studying with the X-Men, she has become adept at directing her blinding strobe light blast from her eyes.

The most powerful manifestation of her laser abilities are a concentrated stream of solid photons she usually fires from her index finger but can emit from her entire body. The beam is extremely powerful and as a consequence uses a great deal of her energy reserves. She has also demonstrated the ability to stretch the electromagnetic spectrum to produce devastating microwave energy.<ref>''Dazzler'' #29</ref> She has since learned how to produce these blasts without draining herself, while still providing them with considerable power.{{issue|date=December 2010}}

When Galactus enlisted her to retrieve his wayward herald [[Terrax]] from the heart of a black hole he had her exposed to unimaginable sounds, including the explosion of an entire galaxy, to boost her to sufficient levels.<ref name="Dazzler #10"/>

Since the events of ''Dazzler: The Movie'', Alison's body can store sound energy for future discharge as light. Thanks to [[Professor X]], Dazzler's costume contains devices that enable her to store sonic energy more efficiently and to gauge and focus the light she generates with greater skill. She has also demonstrated on at least one occasion the ability to expel the stored sound into a devastating wave of sonic energy that destroyed her foe Silence.<ref>''Dazzler'' #42</ref>

Dazzler is immune to the injurious effects of her light transducing abilities. Her ability to transduce sound also protects her from being deafened by loud sounds; In ''Dazzler'' vol. 2 #1, it was indicated that her ears are highly developed allowing her to detect sounds on frequencies that others cannot register.<ref>''^ Richards, Dave (2010-02-08). "MCCANN MAKES DAZZLER SING ONCE MORE". Comic Book Resources. Retrieved 2010-03-19.''</ref> In ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'', Vol. 2, No. 4, she demonstrates the ability to use sound waves for [[Human echolocation|echolocation]] before absorbing them for energy.<ref>''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'', Vol. 2, No. 4</ref> Dazzler has also been shown to be immune to the powers of her half-sister [[Lois London|Mortis]], which ordinarily kills living subjects instantly.<ref name="Dazzler One-Shot 2010">''Dazzler One-Shot'' (2010)</ref>

With considerable strain, Dazzler is capable of generating ultraviolet light in omnidirectional waves of such intensity that it will melt large metal structures.<ref name="Dazzler One-Shot 2010"/>

Dazzler is a highly skilled athlete, and has become an excellent hand-to-hand combatant thanks to her training with the X-Men, and with the Gladiators.<ref>''Beauty and the Beast'' #3</ref> In addition, she is a talented singer, actress, and dancer. She is also a highly accomplished roller skater and can move at high speed; she occasionally wears a pair of roller skates which magnetically adheres to her boots.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
{{Main|Age of Apocalypse}}
Dazzler appears as a member of the X-Men. She is a chain smoker, having no use for a singing voice in this timeline. She is also more skilled with her powers, being able to create hard-light constructs, as well as manipulate both light and sound energies. With this new power-set, Dazzler serves as a one-woman training facility, as well as a messenger via holographic transmissions.<ref>Nicieza, Fabian and Andy Kubert. ''Amazing X-Men'' #1-2.</ref>  She was romantically involved with [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]],<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' v.1 #1</ref> and did not accompany the main team of X-Men in the final assault on [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].

Dazzler was one of the characters involved in the original Age of Apocalypse to be brought back for the ''Age of Apocalypse 10th Anniversary'' miniseries. Like many of the other X-Men, Dazzler's costume in the 10th anniversary reflects an updated take on her original costume: the silver jumpsuit. Against the battle with Mr. Sinister's Sinister Six, Dazzler was swallowed within Cloak's dark dimension, but is ultimately saved by a lightning bolt from Storm which forces Cloak to spit her back out.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #6</ref>

===The End===
In ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', a series about the X-Men's hypothetical future, Dazzler reverted her costume to reflect her classic, silver design, continuing her career as a singer. Dazzler, an occasional "reserve" team member, joined Storm and X-Men members [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Psylocke]], and [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] for Xavier's "Plan B" team. Co-piloting the ship to the extraterrestrial [[Shi'ar]] homeworld, Dazzler uses her powers to create a light show, calming the passions of the battling X-Men and [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]]. The series' primary villain—[[Cassandra Nova]]—then manifests, slaying the Imperial Guard and leaving the remaining X-Men as her sole adversaries. Dazzler attempts to subdue Cassandra along with Storm and Iceman. While she uses her ability to laser a hole through Cassandra's head, Storm strikes her with lightning, giving Iceman a chance to freeze her. Bishop then shatters her in order to prevent her from returning. However, Cassandra simply reforms and, as a form of retaliation, blasts a hole through Dazzler, strikes Storm with energy, and freezes Iceman. She successfully killed Storm and Dazzler, but Iceman survived the ordeal. Dazzler is believed to be among the slain X-Men that were invited to a plane of higher existence by the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]].<ref>Claremont, Chris and Sean Chen. ''X-Men: The End: Book 3'' #5-6.</ref>

===House of M===
When Wanda Maximoff, the [[Scarlet Witch]], used her reality-altering powers to change the world, Dazzler became one of the most famous mutants on Earth. After having a successful singing career as a teenager, Dazzler continued her career as the world's primary media personality via her syndicated talk show.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael and Oliver Coipel. ''House of M'' #2.</ref>

The ''House of M'' newsprint special featured a tabloid-esque [[blind article]], indicating that Alison's signature lightshow was fading due to a rare blood disorder, which was causing her to lose her mutation. Storm used Alison's popular talk show to sound off on her disapproval of Magneto's handling of mutant affairs and [[Mister Sinister]] was seen watching the Alison show when [[Deadpool]] went to rescue an infant [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #17</ref>

Author [[Brian Michael Bendis]] originally scripted for this version of Dazzler to be this altered reality's answer to [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===Marvel Zombies===
Dazzler appears as one of the few uninfected heroes in the limited series ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]''. There, she is almost eaten by an infected [[Bucky Barnes#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]] until he is killed by [[Ash Williams]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness'' vol. 1 #2</ref> Ash is attracted to Dazzler, but she does not reciprocate his feelings. As a thanks for saving her, Dazzler agrees to help Ash find the Necronomicon book that might put an end to the zombies. The duo pair up with the Scarlet Witch to discover that the Necronomicon is being kept at Doctor Doom's fortress in Latveria.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness'' v1. #3</ref> Ash discovers the Necronomicon, but unfortunately it has nothing to do with this world's infection. On his way back, he meets an imprisoned Enchantress. Because of the unusual nature of her powers, Ash believes the Enchantress is unaffected.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness'' vol. 1 #4</ref> In a confrontation with Dazzler, the Enchantress bites off her finger, infecting her with the zombification virus. Before she is transformed, Doctor Doom and Ultron appear, and each of the two metal villains destroys both zombified women.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness'' vol. 1 #5</ref>

However, another zombified Dazzler is quite visible in the bottom left corner of the large center cell on page 13 of Issue #23 of ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' &ndash; part 3 of the three-part arc that introduced the "Marvel Zombies" Universe [the three part arc consisted of ''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' issues 21-23]. As noted, Dazzler was destroyed - disintegrated - by [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Ultron]] in the "Marvel Zombies Vs. Army of Darkness" limited series and hence never lived to become a zombie.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Dazzler is introduced as a punk rock singer in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #42. She briefly joins [[Emma Frost]]'s [[New Mutants|Academy of Tomorrow]] when promised a record deal, but joins the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] after they rescue her from a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attack. There she is called "Dazzler" after the name of her band.

She often shows a lack of enthusiasm for the X-Men and their endeavors, but after learning of a proposed public execution of a mutant, she convinces a group of teammates to go on a rescue mission. When the mission goes astray and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] is captured, Dazzler takes initiative and leads the team in a recovery operation. This leads to the accidental release of [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' vol. 1 #57</ref>

Later, she and Angel go out on a presumed 'date' (really an effort to get themselves involved with the X-Men's latest mission) preventing the ''Academy of Tomorrow'' students from attacking the [[Ultimates|Triskelion]]. During the incident, power is lost and one of the inmates, [[Lady Deathstrike|Deathstrike]], impales Dazzler through the chest. Ironically, Deathstrike is defeated by the very killer Dazzler has assisted before.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #65</ref>

Dazzler stays in a coma for several weeks, visited many times by [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] having an unrequited crush on her. Unfortunately, many factors have combined to unhinge Nightcrawler and as soon as she is able to be moved, she is fooled into thinking they must escape. Initially trusting Nightcrawler, she cooperates until the rest of the X-Men rescue her.<ref name="Ultimate X-Men Annual #2">''Ultimate X-Men Annual'' #2</ref> The others, understanding Nightcrawler is mentally ill, plan to rehabilitate. Dazzler does not accept this and quits the team in protest.<ref name="Ultimate X-Men Annual #2"/>

She has since been labeled as one of the "most important" mutants to the X-Men's cause by the future [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #82</ref> Dazzler later joins Bishop's new team in ''Ultimate X-Men'' #82. When Bishop dies in ''Ultimate X-Men'' #90, Dazzler returned to the Xavier Institute to be with Angel and on Xavier's X-Men team once again. She is seen to be on [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]'s enhanced team, using the drug [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] to boost her powers. The drug enhanced team battles Xavier's main X-Men and eventually leave their drug-filled lives and return to the X-Mansion.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #97</ref>

When [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|worldwide devastation]] hits the X-Men,<ref>''Ultimatum'' vol. 1 #1</ref> Dazzler is revealed by Jean Grey to have been killed along with teammates [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and Nightcrawler.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #98</ref>

The Ultimate iteration of Dazzler does not convert sound into light in this continuity. Her powers are defined as "Matter Detonation"; by detonating small particles in the air, she is able to create brilliant photokinetic effects, controlling the color and intensity of the light created.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' vol. 1 #84</ref> Under the influence of the drug Banshee, Dazzler's powers are vastly increased, and she is able to create solid light constructs such as a sword, a tiger for her to ride into battle, and even a copy of Wolverine's claws, which she uses to fight Wolverine.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' vol. 1 #95-97</ref> Dazzler's true powers are shown when she detonates the matter making up Sentinel robots, completely destroying them with her sheer power.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' vol. 1 #85</ref><ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' vol. 1 #87</ref>

Some while later, [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s house is being sold by a realtor named Alison Blaire.<ref>''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' #11</ref>

===Interlocking Technologies===
A woman from Earth-721 was given the powers and appearance of Dazzler by Interlocking Technologies. She came to Earth-616 and impersonated the original Alison. She toured the Western States of the USA in Dazzler's original costume. However, she was ultimately discovered, stripped of her powers and returned to Earth-721.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #21</ref>

===X-Babies===
A member of the [[X-Babies]] is based on Dazzler.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #12</ref>

===Earth X===
In the [[Earth X]] timeline, Dazzler had her heart torn out by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] though due to the "death" of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], she lives on in constant agony.<ref>''Paradise X'' #2</ref>

===What If?===
In a two-part [[What If (comics)|What If?]] story (What if Cable had destroyed the X-Men? and What if Magneto took over the U.S.A.?) based on ''Uncanny X-Men'' #269, Dazzler is an agent of Magneto.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #46</ref>  She is ultimately killed by a Sentinel warhead.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #47</ref>

In ''What If'' (1st series) #33 (June 1982), Dazzler decides to stay Galactus’ [[herald of Galactus|herald]] after she defeats Terrax. After many years of servitude, during which she guides Galactus to feed on uninhabited worlds in order to spare the lives of beings on other planets, she is free to return to Earth. When she arrives, Dazzler discovers the Earth had become a barren wasteland and, with nowhere else to go, she returns to Galactus who welcomes her return.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 1 #33</ref>

===President Blaire===
In ''X-Men: Battle Of The Atom'', Dazzler becomes the first mutant President of the United States in the future. However, during her Inauguration speech, she is assassinated by fire from flying demons along with Jamie Madrox, and several audience members.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #17</ref>

===Dazzler Thor===
A version of Dazzler appeared during the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline as part of the Thor Corps, a paramilitary organization charged with policing [[Battleworld]] and enforcing the will of [[Doctor Doom|God Emperor Doom]]. Dazzler Thor later appears in the mainstream [[Earth-616]] universe, after coming through a multi-dimensional portal and joins [[A-Force]] in their fight against the Countess, a dragon who came through the same portal. After Countess is defeated, Dazzler Thor succumbs to the effects that this universe's [[Terrigen Mist]]s had on her system and vanishes.<ref>''A-Force'' v2, #5-7 (May–July 2016)</ref>
