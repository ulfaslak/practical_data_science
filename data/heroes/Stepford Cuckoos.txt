The '''Stepford Cuckoos''' are a set of [[fictional character|fictional]] mutant psychically linked [[Multiple birth|quintuplets]] ('''Celeste Cuckoo''', '''Esme Cuckoo''', '''Irma "Mindee" Cuckoo''', '''Phoebe Cuckoo''', and '''Sophie Cuckoo''') appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The alphabetical order of the Cuckoos' first names corresponds with their ages, with Celeste being the firstborn and Sophie being the youngest. Originally calling themselves the '''Five-in-One''', with the deaths of Esme and Sophie the remaining sisters are now known as the '''Three-in-One'''.<ref>''[[New X-Men]]'', vol. 1 #149–150</ref>

They are students at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]]. The Stepford Cuckoos made their live action debut as the Frost sisters in the television series ''[[The Gifted (U.S. TV series)|The Gifted]]'' portrayed by [[Skyler Samuels]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=October 2012}}

First appearing in ''[[New X-Men]]'', vol. 1 #118, they were created by [[Grant Morrison]]. Their origin, as the artificially created "daughters" of [[Emma Frost]], is revealed in ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong|X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong]]''.

Esme and Sophie were among the feature characters in the 2011 two-issue limited series ''Chaos War: X-Men''.

==Fictional character biographies==
===Origins===
As revealed in the first issue of ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong|X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong]]'', the sisters are grown from ova cells harvested from telepath and then villain [[Emma Frost]] while she lay comatose after a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attack that killed her students, the original [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]], and are only five of many cloned daughters. They state that over a thousand of eggs were stolen from Emma's uterus during her coma, and the remaining hundreds (if not thousands) of clones reside within incubation chambers inside a hidden underground laboratory at ''The World'', a complex housing the [[Weapon Plus]] (living beings designed to serve as weapons) program. They were created by [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|Dr. John Sublime]] to be powerful weapons able to kill every mutant by combining their telepathic abilities. The Cuckoos were designated ''Weapon XIV.''

[[Image:Five-in-one.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The Five-in-One<br>Art by [[Frank Quitely]].]]They were first introduced as the protégés and favorites of Emma Frost<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #118</ref> and were unaware of their true purpose and a telepathic block was used to mask their placement in the school, causing anyone who questioned their origins to lose their train of thought.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong'' #2</ref> They, along with student [[Quentin Quire]], were noted as the strongest [[telepathy|telepaths]] among the new students at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute of Higher Learning]]. Although Quire and the Stepford Cuckoos were rivals, Quire had a crush on Sophie. Sophie and the other Cuckoos considered him to be disgusting and rejected him completely.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #134</ref>

Partly as an expression of adolescent rebellion, partly under the influence of a mutant drug called Kick, and partly out of a desire to impress Sophie, Quire incited a student riot at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. Sophie died stopping Quire, having used the same drug to boost her powers and overexerting herself.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #137</ref> The Stepford Cuckoos held Frost to be partially responsible for Sophie's death - with Frost having "inspired her to heroism" - and disassociated themselves from her at that time. With the death of Sophie, the Five-in-One became the Four-in-One. Wary of having a part of themselves missing, they tested to see if their powers still functioned well by contacting [[Jean Grey]] telepathically and informing her that Emma Frost was attempting to conduct an affair with her husband, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]].<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #138</ref>

Secretly, Esme Cuckoo had been collaborating with X-Man [[Xorn]], then disguised as [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Taking control of the Cuckoos' group mind, she telepathically steers [[Angel Salvadore]] to attack Emma Frost, completely shattering her diamond body into fragments. [[Jean Grey]] manages to [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] reassemble Frost and return her to life, whereupon Emma revealed Esme's involvement. Esme then abandons her sisters to join Magneto's new Brotherhood of Mutants. Later losing faith in Xorn, the Brotherhood turns on him, including Esme, who attacks him, angry that he did not return her affections. Xorn then kills her and she dies in Emma's arms, stating with her dying breath that she never wanted to end up like Emma.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #146–150</ref>

===Corsairs===
Soon afterwards, the Institute is rebuilt, with Emma Frost and Cyclops as headmasters and leaders of the [[X-Men]].{{issue|date=November 2012}} Frost and Summers divided the older students into several six-person training squads, each taught by a staff member.{{issue|date=November 2012}} The remaining three Cuckoos, now calling themselves the "''Three-in-One''," were assigned to the [[Xavier Institute Student Body#Corsairs|Corsairs]] squad, advised by Cyclops.{{issue|date=November 2012}} The three girls were the co-leaders of the squad.{{issue|date=November 2012}}

In ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong|X-Men: Phoenix Endsong]]'' (March–June 2005), the cosmic entity known as the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] came back to Earth seeking to inhabit the body of Jean Grey.{{issue|date=November 2012}} Quentin Quire, still in love with Sophie, sensed the Phoenix and [[burial#Exhumation|exhumed]] Sophie's body.{{issue|date=November 2012}} He sought the Phoenix, which resurrected Sophie, but she promptly chooses to die again rather than be with him.{{issue|date=November 2012}} The X-Men defeat the Phoenix, {{issue|date=November 2012}} though a shard of it in firefly form locates Celeste.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong'' #3</ref>

===Weapon Plus and Phoenix—Warsong===
In ''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #154 (May 2004), the Stepford Cuckoos are identified as Weapon XIV (each girl being units 1 to 5, ordered alphabetically by their first names), the living weapon code between Weapon XIII ([[Fantomex]]) and Weapon XV ([[Ultimaton]]).<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #154</ref>

[[Image:Warsong3.PNG|right|150px|thumb|Cover to ''X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong'' #3 depicting the "Thousand-in-One"/Weapon XIV, by [[Marc Silvestri]].]]
Manipulated by both the shard of the Phoenix and Dr. John Sublime, the Cuckoos reanimate Esme and Sophie as corpses and return to the ''[[Weapon Plus#The World|World]]''. At the World, they are greeted by a computer image of Sublime and learn of their thousands of cloned siblings. Their true purpose was to collect data on the X-Men and transmit it to the other clones through shared nano-technology in their bodies. It is revealed that the Phoenix fragment has manifested in order to destroy the Cuckoos and all of their clones to prevent them from being activated as a weapon and killing all mutants. The Phoenix manifests most strongly through Celeste, using her as its avatar, but is then diffused according to Sublime's plans among each of the cloned telepaths, boosting their powers. The Cuckoos then learn that they also shared Emma's ability to turn into a [[Emma Frost#Powers and abilities|diamond form]]. Now referring to themselves as the '''Thousand-in-One''' and under Sublime's control, the cosmically-empowered psychics proceed to enact their programmed destiny of mutant destruction. Celeste, at Emma's behest, accepts her role as a Phoenix host and wrestles control of the Phoenix, freeing the clones from Sublime's control for the first time. However, the Phoenix goes on to destroy the thousand clones, despite their newfound freedom and desire to experience life, by shattering their newly manifested diamond forms as well as Esme and Sophie. Disgusted by the destruction, Celeste casts the entity out of her body. However, it refuses to depart causing Celeste to reabsorb it into her own and Mindee and Phoebe's diamond hearts to end the Phoenix's destruction. Unlike Emma's diamond composition, which contains a flaw, the Cuckoo's hearts are flawless diamond. As such, the Phoenix fragment is literally sealed within their hearts. The price the sisters must pay for this is that they can never again feel emotion, leaving them more detached from others than they were before.<ref name=autogenerated2>''X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong'' #1–5</ref>

===Post Civil War===
The Stepford Cuckoos are being considered as "potential recruits" for the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] program.<ref>''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''</ref> The girls are next seen helping Elixir master medical and anatomical knowledge via Beast's brain. They are soon after teleported to Limbo with the other students and captured by Belasco who has helmets placed on them to keep them asleep to prevent them from using their powers. They were freed by a newly revived X-23 and turn the tide of the battle against Belasco.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 2 #37–41</ref> When the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] attacks Xavier, the [[Astonishing X-Men]], and the [[New X-Men]], the Stepford Cuckoos contact several other X-teams such as [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], the Uncanny X-team, and X-Factor to get their help.<ref>''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #2</ref> They then help [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|Prodigy]] access all his forgotten knowledge and abilities to compensate for his power loss as thanks for saving them when anti-mutant terrorists known as the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] attacked the school.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 2 #43</ref>

===Messiah Complex===
{{Main|X-Men: Messiah Complex}}
The Cuckoos use Cerebro to track down [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who has the missing mutant baby for whom the X-Men are looking.<ref>''X-Factor'', vol. 2 #27''</ref>

When the X-Men arrive at the location indicated by the Cuckoos, the baby had already been stolen by the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. The Cuckoos are unable to relocate the baby telepathically, so Emma Frost orders them to focus on finding the Marauders who kidnapped it.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #494</ref>

===Manifest Destiny===
Following the events of the Messiah Complex, the Cuckoos rejoin the X-Men in their new home of San Francisco, along with many of their former classmates. The girls later agree to help erase Josh Foley's memory of his work with the newly reformed X-Force team, so as to help the team maintain a sense of a secrecy from the main X-Men team. They agree to keep the team a secret, primarily out of loyalty to Cyclops. The girls have recently begun to dress more individually than before, no longer wearing matching outfits. Each of them also have different hairstyles, with only one of the Cuckoos keeping their prior hairstyle.<ref>''X-Force'', vol. 3 #7</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
{{Main|Secret Invasion}}
The Cuckoos help oppose Skrull invaders in San Francisco. When the Skrulls place a blockade on all telepathic communication, they channel their telepathy through Cerebra into Emma as she attempts to find the psychic blockade and destroy it. Emma's psyche is briefly disconnected from her body and as she fights the Skrull psychics, the Cuckoos, on orders from Cyclops, use their telepathy to keep Emma's [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic functions]] going.<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #1–4</ref> Afterward, the Cuckoos appear as supporting characters in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]''.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #500</ref>

===Nation X===
During a pitched battle between the X-Men and a pack of genetically altered versions of [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]], the Phoenix fragments that were contained in the Cuckoos' diamond hearts leave them and depart into space for reasons unknown.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #517</ref> During their time on Utopia, the Cuckoos begin to experience boredom and start sneaking off the island to buy DVDs of horror films. Influenced by the movies, the girls start mentally torturing their classmates using scenarios from ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' and ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'' among others. After Emma discovers this, she reveals that as a child she was a fan of the film ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', and that she occasionally daydreams of being in the movie herself. Realizing that she always loved teaching, Emma decides to make the Cuckoos into teachers for the island's school, thus giving them something to do with their time.<ref>''Nation X'' #4</ref>

===Chaos War===
During the "[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]" storyline, Esme and Sophie are among the fallen X-Men members who return from the dead after what happened to the death realms. Sophie confronted Esme about her death with little resolution. During this time, Sophie befriended [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]. While searching for answers among the remains of the Xavier Institute, the former X-Men were attacked by Carrion Crow: Eater of the Dead.<ref>''Chaos War: X-Men'' #1</ref> Esme later sacrificed herself to save her sister from Carrion Crow. In the aftermath of the defeat of the Chaos King, Sophie is returned to the afterlife after reality is restored by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. Thunderbird even commented that the next time that he is resurrected, it would be with Sophie.<ref>''Chaos War: X-Men'' #2</ref>

===Regenesis===
After "Schism" Phoebe wanted to go to Westchester while Irma wanted to stay at Utopia, leaving the deciding vote to Celeste, who chose Utopia after learning that Quentin Quire was going to be at Westchester.<ref>''X-Men: Regenesis'' #1</ref> Following the death of Charles Xavier and the appearance in the present day of the original five X-Men, the Cuckoos decide to join Cyclops's new iteration of the Xavier School.<ref name="All-New X-Men #10">''All-New X-Men'' #10</ref>

===Wolverine and the X-Men===
During ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men|AvX]]'' the Stepford Cuckoos came to stay at the Jean Grey School.{{issue|date=April 2013}} When Cyclops and his team came to confront Beast about bringing the original X-Men forward in time the Cuckoos left with them.<ref name="All-New X-Men #10"/> When Teen Angel tried to leave Wolverine's school Teen Jean tried to force him to stay against his will. As punishment the Cuckoos forced Teen Jean into submission and only relented after Teen Jean had learned her "lesson." Angel then left to join Cyclops's team much to Teen Jean's grief since they were supposed to stay together.

===Uncanny X-Men===
After joining the team and getting settled in, Irma changes her hair style, much to Celeste's horror, though Emma approves and encourages Irma and her sisters to be their own people. Irma spots Triage and both seem to have an attraction to each other, but neither acts on it. They later participate as members of Cyclops's team during the Battle of the Atom.{{issue|date=December 2013}}

When the time-displaced team of the original X-Men join Cyclops's team, Celeste becomes hostile towards the time-displaced teenage Jean Grey. During an excursion to a mall, Jean reveals to Celeste that Irma and Phoebe do not have a problem with her like Celeste does. The group encounters a member of the [[Inhumans]], and the Cuckoos as well as Jean Grey are knocked out.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 3) 15.INH</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Cuckoos share a [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[collective consciousness|hive mind]]. Powerful telepaths individually, their combined power is even greater than its sum. These powers allow them the psychic standards of broadcasting/receiving thoughts, mind control, planting illusions, force blasts of pure psionic energy, astral projection, etc. Their gestalt mind allows them to communicate with one another instantaneously, though the strength of their [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] depends on their proximity to one another; the further they are from one another, the weaker their ability to connect.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Stepford_Cuckoos Stepford Cuckoos - Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Though they most often function and act as one unit, they are indeed capable of thinking and operating individually. When all five sisters were alive, Sophie was the dominant consciousness and often commanded the Cuckoos. However, as implied by Esme's actions, it is possible for another one of the Cuckoos to wrest control of the gestalt and perhaps even use the powers of all sisters without the consent and knowledge of the others. With the loss of Sophie and Esme, The Cuckoos are not as strong as they were with five.<ref>''X-Men'', vol. 2 #156</ref>

Like their mother, Emma Frost, each Cuckoo sister also possesses the ability to transform into an organic diamond body, and as such gains invulnerability, durability, and super strength. Unlike Frost, however, their diamond forms are flawless; such that nothing can enter or escape. They demonstrate this ability by sealing the splintered fragment of the Phoenix Force inside their hearts by permanently changing their hearts to diamond, in the process sacrificing their ability to ever feel genuine emotions again. The Phoenix Force eventually manages to escape, potentially allowing the sisters to regain their emotions. During the ''Warsong'' series, the Cuckoos gained the power of flight and [[pyrokinesis]], presumably from Phoenix-induced telekinesis.<ref name=autogenerated1>''X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong'' #1</ref>

Additionally, the Cuckoos have demonstrated telekinesis.<ref>''All New X-Men'', vol. 1 #30</ref>

The power level of the Cuckoos, in all of their incarnations, have been reported by many of the staff at Xavier's School to be extremely impressive and strong.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

===Personalities===
====Sophie Cuckoo====
Sophie Cuckoo's personality is explored just before her death. She was stated as always being the dominant mind amongst her sisters. When Quentin Quire began a riot on the Xavier Campus, Sophie was "inspired to heroism" and used Kick to strengthen her powers and fight him. The strain killed Sophie, though it was secretly Esme's psychic influence that ultimately pushed her toward death. She has since been portrayed in other realities as the most free-thinking of the Cuckoos.

====Phoebe Cuckoo====
Phoebe Cuckoo demonstrated a power-hungry personality during the events of ''Warsong''. In contrast to Celeste, who feared the consuming power of the Phoenix, Phoebe desired power out of the sheer affinity for wielding it. She readily embraced the Phoenix and enjoyed the destructive power it gave her.

====Irma "Mindee" Cuckoo====
Mindee Cuckoo was the next Cuckoo to be written with a distinct personality. She had a relationship with another student, Germaine, who was killed by an anti-mutant mob when the students were trapped in a building in the aftermath of Xorn's destruction of Manhattan. She then had a combative relationship with [[Icarus (comics)|Jay Guthrie]] who was always interrupting her while she played the piano. She later helped Gambit during [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]'s Brotherhood's attack on the school. Her real first name is "Irma".<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=3155&disp=table Preview to ''Uncanny'' #514]</ref>

Irma has now dyed her hair and cut it short; she is now a brunette. Triage is attracted to her and the feeling might be mutual.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. #3 #9</ref>

====Celeste Cuckoo====
During the events of ''Warsong'', Celeste Cuckoo expressed fears of losing touch with her sisters, changing personalities, and wielding the Phoenix Force. According to Emma, she is the tattletale of the group.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> She eventually accepted her powers, killing the Thousand-in-One clones and her resurrected sisters per the cosmic judgment of Phoenix. Disgusted by the destruction the Phoenix caused, she tried to expel the Phoenix fragment from her body, but was instead forced to seal it inside Mindee's, Phoebe's, and her own diamond hearts. She is portrayed as the most compassionate of all the Cuckoos.

Upon meeting a teenage Jean Grey who was brought to the present by Beast, Celeste takes an instant dislike towards her and they are constantly bickering.{{issue|date=December 2013}} When Irma decides to change her hair style and act more like an individual, Celeste is horrified at the thought of losing her connection to her sister.{{issue|date=December 2013}} Much to her despair, Emma welcomes the sisters' growing individuality.{{issue|date=December 2013}} Celeste also finds that her sisters both have little problem with Jean, furthering their divide.{{issue|date=December 2013}}

====Esme Cuckoo====
[[Image:Esme.png|100pxpx|thumb|Esme, after leaving her sisters and joining Xorn's Brotherhood of Mutants]]
Esme Cuckoo was the first to split from her sisters, falling in love with [[Shi'ar]]-soldier Stuff who disguised itself as a student.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #123</ref> She soon attempts to [[murder]] Frost, and was later revealed to be the one responsible for the events that killed Sophie. Wanting to seize control of the Cuckoos but encountering resistance from Sophie, Esme used the drug Kick on herself to augment her own psychic powers and take control of the Stepford Cuckoos' group mind. Esme manipulated her sister Sophie into also using the drug Kick in order to overexert her telepathic powers to the point of death. Esme returned in the ''[[X-Men: Planet X|Planet X]]'' storyline, in which it was revealed that Esme had been working for [[Xorn]] the entire time, and that she had developed a crush on him. However, Esme turned on him and tried to destroy his mind after he rejected her affections. Xorn reluctantly was forced to kill her. She dies in Emma's arms, who tells Esme that out of all the Cuckoos, she was most proud of her.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #150</ref>

==Conceptual changes==
Originally, the first letter of each of the Cuckoo's names was supposed to spell out the word "spice" when put in proper sequence, '''S'''ophie, '''P'''hoebe, '''I'''rma,  '''C'''eleste and '''E'''sme, a reference to the British pop group, the [[Spice Girls]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} However, Grant Morrison never mentioned the name of the fifth Cuckoo (the one whose name was supposed to start with "'''I'''") during his run on New X-Men, and it was only later on that this fifth Cuckoo was named "Mindee" by [[Chuck Austen]], who was unaware of Morrison's [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]]. However, writer [[Matt Fraction]] later rectified this, stating that Mindee's real first name was Irma, thus restoring the original acronym.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #514 (August 2009)</ref>

They were first called the Stepford Cuckoos in ''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #123 (April 2002), which was also the first issue in which Esme was named. Sophie, Phoebe, Celeste, and Mindee were named in ''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #134 (January 2003), ''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #149 (January 2004), ''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #153 (April 2004), and ''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #156 (June 2004), respectively. In the ''New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook'', their last name was confirmed as "Cuckoo" and their codename as the "Three-in-One".

==Other versions==
===Age of X===
In the "[[Age of X]]" reality, the Stepford Cuckoos are shown as inmates of Fortress X's X-Brig.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #245</ref>

===Exiles===
In a reality shown in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'', where after the Hulk was jettisoned into space and discovered by [[Annihilus]], killing him and taking the [[Annihilation Wave]] to Earth, Sophie, Esme and Mindee appear as some of the few remaining superhumans. Sophie has detached herself from the two remaining Cuckoos and is dating [[Quentin Quire]], while Esme and Mindee remain like their original depictions in the main Marvel Universe. Sophie's mental abilities have also increased, and she has recurring dreams of future events to come.<ref>''Exiles: Days of Then and Now'' #1</ref>

===Here Comes Tomorrow===
In the "[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]" timeline, 150 years from now, Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe are members of the X-Men and operators of Cerebra, having merged with the machine, and calling themselves the "''Three-in-One''." Their psychic powers have also been amplified, allowing them to see the future. Despite the long time that has passed, they appear to be in their early twenties. With the release of the ''Warsong'' miniseries this can be attributed to the nanites in their bodies and their origins as Weapon XIV.<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 1 #151–154</ref>
[[File:"Stepford Cuckoos" from "House of M".jpg|150px|thumb|right|The House of M Five-in-One<br>Art by [[Aaron Lopresti]].]]

===House of M===
{{Main|House of M}}
In ''[[House of M]]'', the quintuplets were part of the New Mutant Leadership Program at the [[United Nations]]. From the five, Sophie appeared to be the one with the stronger personality. Sophie joined [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|Prodigy]], [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] and the rest of the New Mutants on their trip to Japan to find Seiji Ashida, while Celeste, Esme, Mindee, and Phoebe remained in New York, though they agreed to maintain the secret. Sophie was later killed in Japan by anti-mutant terrorists.<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #16–19</ref>

===X-Men: The End===
{{Main|X-Men: The End}}
In the alternate future depicted in ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', Celeste, Mindee, and Phoebe have each developed their own look and now call themselves "''the Spikes''." Phoebe has long, brown hair, Mindee has long, blond hair, and Celeste has short, black hair.

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the animated series ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', The Stepford Cuckoos (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) appear alongside the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Inner Circle]] in the three part episode "Foresight".<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'', episodes 23–26</ref> They assist [[Emma Frost]] into tricking [[Jean Grey]] to release the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. After the Inner Circle betrays Emma, the Cuckoos are ordered to finish the job. All five serve as hosts for the Phoenix Force and wear the traditional red and gold Dark Phoenix costumes. As warned by Emma, the Phoenix Force becomes too powerful for the Cuckoos to control. It leaves their bodies after Jean Grey calls to Phoenix, asking it to return to her body. However, as the Phoenix Force attempts to return to Jean, Emma intercepts the Phoenix and sacrifices herself to destroy it.
