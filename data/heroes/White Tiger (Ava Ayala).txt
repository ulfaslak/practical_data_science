==In other media==
===Television===
* The Ava Ayala version of White Tiger appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Caitlyn Taylor Love]].<ref>http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=770</ref> She is seen on the same team as [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]]. Paul Dini, the show's creative consultant stated, "We wanted a young female voice on the team and while she is new, White Tiger proved to be the perfect choice. She's tough and smart, and her cat-like reflexes allow her to match Spider-Man leap for leap in agility. It's important to her that she excels at everything she does, as she plans on leaving the team someday as a full super heroine in her own right".<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/tv/ultimate-spider-man-tv-characters-120228.html</ref> In the season two, episode "Kraven the Hunter", it is revealed that Ava's father was [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|the previous White Tiger]], rather than her brother until he was killed in a fight with [[Kraven the Hunter]] just like her grandfather before him. Eventually, Kraven came after Ava (the current keeper of the amulet). Unlike Ava, the amulet's raw feral power proved too much for him to keep under control and induces a harrowing transformation into a humanoid [[white tiger]]. Upon Ava reclaiming her amulet, Kraven was defeated by Spider-Man and Ava. In season three episode "Cloak and Dagger", White Tiger is one of the heroes controlled by [[Dormammu]] to invade earth. After being free of Dormammu mind control, Ava gets a new costume which has more stripes on it. In finale season four, "Graduation Day, Pt. 1 and 2," she, Iron Fist, Nova and Power Man are with Spider-Man for the last time to find [[Doctor Octopus]] and protect [[Aunt May]], and fight the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] that becomes the new Lizard, and defeat them. She is then trapped with the others in contracting shield in the Triskelion and in the end is released by Spider-Man.
** The episode "Return to the Spider-Verse" Pt. 1 features an alternate universe version of Ava Ayala (voiced by [[Cree Summer]]) who is a vampire that is loyal to Lizard King. Thanks to the Siege Perilous fragment and a UV Light, Spider-Man and Kid Arachnid were able to cure everyone of the vampire strain.
