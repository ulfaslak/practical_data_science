'''Margaret''' "'''Peggy'''" '''Carter''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is usually depicted as a supporting character in books featuring [[Captain America]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], she first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #77 as a [[World War II]] love interest of Steve Rogers in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequences. She would later be better known as a relative of Captain America's modern-day significant other [[Sharon Carter]].

[[Hayley Atwell]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], beginning with ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011), and continuing in the [[Marvel One-Shot]] ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'', ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), the television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' and ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Marvel's Agent Carter]]'', ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019). Atwell will return to voice an alternate version of the character called Captain Carter in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] animated series ''[[What If (comics)|What If...?]]'' on Disney+, which will debut in mid 2021.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared, unnamed, as a wartime love interest of Captain America in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #75 (single panel) and #77 (May 1966), by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/characters/peggy-carter | title=Peggy Carter | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=21 December 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/20053/#147873 "If a Hostage Should Die!"], ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #77 (May 1966) at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> She appeared again as the older sister of [[Sharon Carter]] in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #161 (May 1973). She was later [[retcon]]ned as Sharon's aunt due to the [[floating timeline|unaging nature]] of comic book characters (see ''Captain America'' Vol. 5 #25 (April 2007)). The character has appeared frequently in Captain America stories set during [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Peggy subdues the soldiers and holds Nick Fury Jr. at gunpoint in order to straighten him out.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 9 #12-13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Abilities==
Peggy Carter is shown to be a superb hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist. She excels in using firearms and is an experienced tactician and commander.

As Dryad, Peggy wears a type of battle armor that is strong enough to protect her from a missile attack and keep her insulated when it is ablaze.
