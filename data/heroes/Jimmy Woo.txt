'''James Woo''' ('''Woo Yen Jet''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[secret agent]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Entertaining Comics|EC Comics]] writer [[Al Feldstein]] and artist [[Joe Maneely]], the [[Chinese-American]] character first appeared in ''[[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]'' #1 (October 1956) from [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s predecessor of Marvel. Woo has since appeared occasionally in a variety of Marvel publications.

The character is played by [[Randall Park]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. In ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', he is an FBI agent and Scott Lang’s parole officer, a role he is slated to reprise in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]''.

==Publication history==
Jimmy Woo was the hero of the [[spy fiction|espionage]] series ''[[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]'', named for his [[antagonist]], a "[[yellow peril]]" [[Communist]] [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]].{{clarify|reason="communist mandarin"? Is this a joke?|Obviously we're talking about fiction, but we shouldn't do so matter-of-factly as though such material isn't nonsense.|date=January 2018}} While the short-lived series named after that villain ran only four issues (October 1956 - April 1957), it featured art by Maneely, [[Jack Kirby]], and [[John Severin]].

Kirby took over as writer-artist with issue #2 — [[inker|inking]] his own [[penciller|pencil art]] there and in the following issue, representing two of the very rare occasions on which he did so. On the final issue, the inking was done by [[Western fiction|Western]]- and [[war-comics]] veteran Severin. Also, other artists drew the covers: Severin on #2 and #4, [[Bill Everett]] on #3.

Well regarded{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} for its relatively mature storyline and in particular for Maneely's exquisitely atmospheric art,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} the book nevertheless failed to find an audience. Woo and other characters from the series were brought into the Marvel universe a decade later, beginning with the "[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]" story in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #160 (Sept. 1967). Woo joins that espionage agency in ''[[Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (1968 series)|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' #2 (July 1968).

Woo went on to be featured in the 1977-1979 Marvel series ''[[Godzilla (comics)|Godzilla]]'' and the 2006-07 Marvel series ''[[Agents of Atlas]]''. Before the cancellation of the 1990s [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] Marvel imprint [[Razorline]], as produced but unpublished titles of its various series were preparing to blend the Razorline into primary Marvel continuity, Woo as well as [[Nick Fury]] and other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents guest-starred in ''Wraitheart'' #5.<!--sources for previous sentence include:

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:JimmyWoo ST.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jimmy Woo, from ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #166 (March 1968). Art by [[Jim Steranko]] & [[Joe Sinnott]].]]
James Woo is an [[Asian-American]] [[FBI]] agent assigned primarily to investigate and apprehend the [[China|Chinese]]-national mandarin known as the Yellow Claw, a [[Fu Manchu]] [[manqué]] (author [[Sax Rohmer]] had a Fu Manchu novel titled ''[[The Yellow Claw]]''). The Yellow Claw, who attempts world domination, claimed in 2000s comics that his American rubric is a mistransliteration of the Chinese characters for "Golden Claw".<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' #4 (Jan. 2007)</ref> Complicating matters, the Claw's grandniece, Suwan, was in love with Woo in the 1950s series.

In [[retcon]] stories, Woo is the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent assigned in 1958 to oversee the 1950s superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], a short-lived predecessor of the later, more established team of that name.<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' Vol. 1, #9 (June 1978)</ref><ref>the 2000s miniseries ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]''.</ref>

As a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Woo went on to join its "[[Godzilla Squad]]" to hunt down the giant monster [[Godzilla]] (the character from the long-running series of films from the [[Japan]]ese [[movie studio]] [[Toho]]). This unit, led by [[Dum Dum Dugan]], employed such weapons as a [[Mecha|giant robot]] called [[Red Ronin]] (for which Woo was shortlisted as a pilot candidate), and was headquartered in a smaller version of the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]], known as the Behemoth.<ref>''Godzilla'' #1-24</ref>

Woo was temporarily replaced by a [[Life Model Decoy]] (a form of [[Android (robot)|artificial human]] utilized by S.H.I.E.L.D.) of the self-aware, renegade "Deltan" class,<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1 (June 1988)</ref> and went through five such bodies before dying with other repentant LMDs.<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #6 (Nov. 1988)</ref> Woo reemerged from stasis, along with other high-ranking officers that had been taken and replaced.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD'' Vol.2 #44</ref>

In 2006-2007 stories, Woo attempted a secret raid of a group identified as [[Agents of Atlas|The Atlas Foundation]]. Going [[AWOL]] and taking several other willing agents with him, he infiltrated an Atlas Foundation location, resulting in all the recruits being killed. Woo was critically burned and lost higher brain function. The former 1950s Avenger [[Gorilla-Man]], by now also a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, gave the organization a classified record of the 1950s team, of which S.H.I.E.L.D. had no prior knowledge. Gorilla-Man rescues Woo with the aid of fellow 1950s teammates [[M-11 (comics)|M-11]] and [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]], who restores Woo to his 1958 self.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' vol. 1 #1</ref>

Along with his teammates he follows the Atlas Foundation all over the world, unlocking secrets about his teammates former lives, restoring [[Namora]] to life,<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' vol. 1 #4</ref> and eventually confronting Yellow Claw, who reveals that the whole ordeal was only a test. As Woo passed it flawlessly, he commits [[suicide]] by having the [[dragon]] Mr. Lao devour him, ending his long life and granting to Jimmy Woo his role as Head of the Atlas Foundation, with Mr. Lao's service and Suwan's hand.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' vol. 1 #6</ref> Woo later surfaces in New York, where he and [[Spider-Man]] shut down a rebellious cell of the Atlas Foundation.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

During the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, it is shown that Jimmy is now the head of the Pan-Asian School For The Unusually Gifted, a [[Mumbai]]-based school for Asian teenagers with superhuman abilities. Jimmy Woo runs the school with Sanjar Javeed as a fellow teacher.<ref>''Infinity: The Hunt'' #1</ref>

Jimmy appears alongside several Asian American superheroes ([[Amadeus Cho|The Hulk (Amadeus Cho)]], [[Kamala Khan|Ms. Marvel]], [[Shang-Chi]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]] and S.H.E.I.L.D agent Jake Oh) for a charity event in [[Flushing, Queens]].  Later while hanging out in New York City, they are attacked by an invading alien army. During the battle, the heroes and a number of civilians are transported to a base near Seknarf Seven, the aliens' home planet, and learn that they will be consumed.  Dubbing their new group "the Protectors" Jimmy rallies the group and civilians to prepare for battle. After elaborating an escape plan, Prince Regent Phalkan, ruler of Seknarf Seven, arrives with his soldiers and demands that three of the humans turn themselves in. When Amadeus, Jimmy and Jake offer themselves to the aliens, the remaining Protectors and civilians use their gadgets to disable the alien equipment enabling the heroes to fight them easily and for Amadeus to turn back into the Hulk. But when the aliens kill Jeffrey, one of the civilians, the group charges towards them.  Jimmy comes close to killing Phalkan, only to be stopped by Amadeus. After the battle, Jimmy contacts the [[Alpha Flight]] Space Program who then arrive to rescue the group and arrest the Prince Regent, who [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] reveals to Jimmy was actually exiled from Seknarf Seven for treason. Amadeus and Jimmy later have a discussion until they are transported back home. A few days later, Amadeus, Ms. Marvel and Silk visit a children's hospital while Jimmy watches the event on TV.<ref>''The Totally Awesome Hulk'' #13-18</ref>

During the ''[[War of the Realms]]'' event, after the Protectors perform a demonstration for Jimmy's school, he offers them membership to the Agents of Atlas; during the meeting they are suddenly alerted by the news of [[War of the Realms|Malekith's invasion of Earth]].  Most of the New Agents of Atlas head to [[Seoul]] while Ms. Marvel joins Jake Oh and the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] in New York.  The Agents find Seoul under attack Malekith's ally Queen Sindr and her Fire Goblin forces from [[Muspelheim]] and team up with the Korean heroes [[White Fox (Marvel Comics)|White Fox]], [[Crescent (comics)|Crescent, Io]] and [[Luna Snow]] who are defending the city.  Jimmy is knocked unconscious when their aircraft crash lands, forcing an unprepared Amadeus, now going by Brawn, to take charge of the team.  After Sindr threatens to summon a volcano in the middle of the city and kill millions of innocents, Amadeus uses Bruce Banner's technology to teleport Atlas and their new allies away from the battle, allowing Sindr to annex [[South Korea]].  Afterwards Amadeus teleports the Chinese heroes [[Sword Master (Marvel Comics)|Sword Master]] and [[Aero (Marvel Comics)|Aero]], [[Philippines|Filipina]] heroine [[Wave (Marvel Comics)|Wave]], and the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian]] goddess of Fire and Volcanoes [[Pele (deity)|Pele]] from [[Shanghai]] to help assist in the fight against Sindr.  The newly summoned heroes are less than pleased for being taken out of their previous battle, but Pele quickly puts a stop to the infighting, warning the group that Sindr plans to melt the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice caps]] if they do not work together.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>  Jimmy, Amadeus and White Fox contact Codec from [[Tokyo]]'s Future Avengers, [[Triumph Division#Red Feather|Red Feather]] of [[Manila]]'s [[Triumph Division]] and the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King Sun Wukong]] in [[Beijing]] to form a battle plan.  After formulating a plan, Brawn confronts Sindr and her forces directly while Aero, Wave and Luna use Sindr's black Bifrost to travel to the [[Arctic]] to decrease its temperature; Jimmy and the remaining members are teleported to Northern China where Shang-Chi begins training them for their final fight.  After a long fight, Amadeus is eventually overwhelmed and is taken prisoner by Sindr, who begins flying with her forces to Northern China.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>  As planned by Brawn, the Queen of Cinders and her forces arrive in Northern China with a captured Brawn, only to be taken by surprise by the Agents; Pele reveals herself to be M-41 Zu, a mystically enhanced android created by Jimmy and the Atlas foundation, who absorbs Sindr's energy and self destructs, weakening her.  With Shang-Chi's training the group defeats her, although at the cost of Sun Wukong sacrificing himself.  Despite given the chance by Jimmy to surrender, Sindr flees using the Black Bifrost, only for the Agents to follow her with Brawn's teleporter, where they help [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] defeat her and her remaining forces at the [[Great Wall of China]] near [[Beijing]].  While the team recuperates in [[Shanghai]] after Malekith's defeat, Brawn confronts Jimmy for withholding the truth about Pele from the team as M-41 could have been used to defeat Sindr in Seoul earlier.  Jimmy justifies his actions, saying that using the android earlier would have killed civilians and that he hid the truth to guarantee the team's success, noting that "Pele" was able to lead the team when Amadeus could not.  Amadeus then warns Jimmy of the ramifications for impersonating a god and tells him that the team can longer trust him. After Amadeus leaves to check on his teammates, Jimmy quietly congratulates him and the rest of the group.<ref>''War of the Realms: The New Agents of Atlas'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the ''War of the Realms'' event, Jimmy has resumed his duties as the head of the Atlas Foundation while Amadeus is appointed as the leader of the New Agents.  While Amadeus has a video meeting with Jimmy from the Atlas bunker in Seoul, their conversation is interrupted when the city is suddenly merged with other Asian and Asian dominated cities into the portal city of Pan by Isaac Ikeda.  Meanwhile, Jimmy has sent the original team to [[Thailand]] to rescue a captured [[List_of_Avengers_members#Infiltrators|Avenger X]].  During the mission, the group encounters a dragon named Mr. Thong, who reveals himself to be an enemy of Mr. Lao.  Thong mocks the Agents and the Atlas Foundation being pawns for Lao and warns them of the upcoming ''Clash of Dragons''.  After the Agents relay their encounter, Jimmy has the team find out more about the dragons, noting that he might have kicked off the upcoming war.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #1. Marvel Comics</ref>  While Jimmy and Lao are monitoring the New Agents, Lao forbids Jimmy from contacting them, believing that they are not yet ready to be trusted.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' Vol 3 #3. Marvel Comics</ref>

==Reception==
Jeff Yang, curator of the "Marvels & Monsters: Unmasking Asian Images in U.S. Comics, 1942-1986" exhibit at the [[Japanese American National Museum]], called Jimmy Woo a "positive exception" to the "largely negative" depiction of Asians and Asian-Americans in comics at time when "the view of Asians was shaped by racist, xenophobic wartime propaganda."<ref>{{cite web |last=Wada |first=Karen |date=2013-12-08 |title=‘Marvels & Monsters’ exhibit explores comics’ portrayal of Asians |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/comics/marvels-monsters-exhibit-explores-comics-portrayal-of-asians/ |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2013-12-09}}</ref>
