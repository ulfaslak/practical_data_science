==Fictional character biography==
Eric Savin was a lieutenant colonel in the [[United States Army]] at Camp Killian, and was put in charge of Project: Ultra-Tech. There he met the love of his life, Lieutenant Gina Dyson. While on patrol, Savin stepped onto a freshly planted mine which blew him into pieces. He was dead for 2.3 minutes. Gina immediately performed cybernetic surgery on him. The surgery was successful — Savin was alive, but resurrected as a cyborg by [[Mako (comics)|Mako]]'s Project: Ultra-Tech. Dyson aided him in battling Mako's robots and apparently slew Mako in combat.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #26-35</ref> He then goes by "Coldblood-7" from there on; the 7 in the name was a mere wordplay on his real name as his surname is pronounced in the same way.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #26</ref>

Coldblood became an urban soldier cyborg, operating as a freelance mercenary. He evaded capture by [[Mechadoom]].<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #4</ref> Coldblood hunted down and fought the third [[Deathlok]] in Paris. He then joined forces with Deathlok and [[Siege (John Kelly)|Siege]] in defeating [[Harlan Ryker]]'s cyber-warriors.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #18-21</ref>

Coldblood gave in to his cyborg-form at one point but was brought back to the human side in him with Gina's help.<ref name="Marvel Comics Presents #32">''Marvel Comics Presents'' #32</ref>

In later missions, Coldblood was hired by [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]] and had to get a stolen biochemical weapon back from Dr. Jonathan Cayre's lab. Coldblood gained the help of the original [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] team and succeeded in his mission.<ref name="Marvel Comics Presents #32"/> Again later, he worked together with fellow cyborg [[Deathlok]], [[Silver Sable]] and the [[Wild Pack|Wildpack]] against the villain group [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]].<ref>''Beyond'' #4</ref>

In the 2006-2007 ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Coldblood was one of the many super-heroes against the [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]], and was arrested.<ref>''Civil War'' #3</ref> He is seen being transported to the Pro-Registration super-prison 42 built within the [[Negative Zone]], but almost immediately suffers a paralyzing, psychotic break apparently due to the sensory warping effects of his new environment and his own anguish.<ref>''Civil War: Frontline'' #5</ref> Later, he is seen in the background behind [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] and the others just before the final confrontation after being freed during the exodus created by the resistance.<ref>[[Mark Millar]] (w), [[Steve McNiven]] (p), [[Dexter Vines]] (i). ''Civil War'' #6 Marvel Comics.</ref> Coldblood then participated during the battle between both sides, and was later referred to being [[missing in action]].<ref>''Civil War: Battle Damage Report'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Eric Savin was converted into the cyborg Coldblood-7 by Dr. Gina Dyson and other Project: Ultra-Tech surgeons following designs by Mako. This gave him superhuman strength, reflexes, speed, stamina, durability, and enhanced sensory systems including night vision. He can see into the infrared. Coldblood also has the ability to interface with virtually any computer system, and, by mentally entering "cyberspace", to communicate with such systems. He has a wetware-grafted computer grafted to his organic brain, a plasti-steel-reinforced skeleton, an artificial heart, synthetic hemoglobin, and artificial right eye. His legs are clearly cybernetic, while his arms are composed of synthetic skin and muscle over a plasti-steel skeleton. The right half of his face is an armored cybernetic implant. The exact limits of his strength are not known, but he is able to engage effectively in combat with Deathlok; an arguably much more advanced cyborg. His artificial muscles do eventually fatigue, but he can perform at full exertion for many hours without tiring. The organic portions of Coldblood's body still require food, drink, oxygen and sleep; however his artificial blood and organs grant him considerable resistance to diseases and radiation. His in-built computer analyses his sensory input; tracks targets and is capable of seeing through illusions, detecting holograms and so forth. It requires a recharge of electricity every twelve months of active service. The portion of Coldblood's organic brain that accessed his personal memories was removed during surgery that made him into a cyborg.

Coldblood wears body armor and uses conventional firearms, including a .357 automatic gun implanted in his artificial left hand. Mako and Project: Ultra-Tech also specially designed a high speed automobile for him, with built-in guns. It can be either remote controlled by a device in Coldblood's left wrist, or automatically by his in-built computer.

Coldblood is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, highly trained in commando fighting and is a superb marksman with conventional firearms.
