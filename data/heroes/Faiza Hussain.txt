Faiza was created by writer [[Paul Cornell]], first penciled by [[Leonard Kirk]]. First appearing in ''[[Captain Britain and MI: 13]]'' #1 (May 2008), Faiza Hussain is used as the title's "[[Point of view (literature)|point of view character]]".<ref name="MarvelBI">[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3312.British_Invasion "British Invasion"], [[Marvel.com]], March 24, 2008</ref>

==Characterization==
Cornell has been aided in the development of this character by a panel of Muslim women:<ref name="DBS">[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12839 DAMN BLOODY SKRULLS: CAPTAIN BRITAIN AND MI: 13], [[Comic Book Resources]], April 29, 2008</ref> Mona Bayoumi, Safiya Sayed Baharun, Farida Patel, and Sohere Roked.<ref name="CB&MI3#2">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = The Guns Of Avalon | Title = Captain Britain and MI: 13 | Issue = 2 | Date = August 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

Faiza Hussain, originally written in early scripts as "Fai'''s'''a", is named after the former [[England cricket team|England]] [[cricket]] Captain [[Nasser Hussain]]<ref name="DBS"/> and although she is a [[British Muslim]] character, creator Paul Cornell has stated he does not want Faiza to be a pillar for the entire British Muslim community:  
{{cquote|I think superheroes are too prone to being standard bearers for whole communities.|30px|30px|Paul Cornell<ref name="PConFH">[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12839 Super Spy Weekend: Faisa Hussain], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 9, 2008</ref>}}
He also did not want her to say anything religious until in a situation where an everyday religious person would and steered her away from the normal [[cliché]]s associated with Muslim characters.

==Fictional character biography==
Faiza Hussain is the only daughter of a family of [[Pakistan]]i heritage who live in [[Chelmsford]] in [[Essex]].<ref name="PConFH"/> A [[London]]-based [[Muslim]] medical doctor, and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[superhero]] [[fangirl]], Faiza initially gets caught up in the [[Skrull|Skrull's]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] as she is performing battlefield [[triage]] while the Skrull attack is going on around her.<ref name="CB&MI13#1"/> While tending to the wounded, alongside the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], Faiza Hussain is struck by a Skrull laser weapon, this weapon seemingly gives Faiza powers which she uses to help Black Knight fend off more Skrulls.<ref name="CB&MI3#2"/>

After the defeat of the Skrulls, Faiza Hussain became the wielder of [[Excalibur]],<ref name="CBMI4">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]]| Story = The Guns Of Avalon | Title = Captain Britain and MI: 13 | Issue = 4 | Date = October 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> and joined MI:13 as Black Knight's [[Steward (office)|steward]].<ref name="CBMI5">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Pat Olliffe]] | Inker = [[Paul Neary]]| Story = Hell In Birmingham | Title = Captain Britain and MI: 13 | Issue = 5 | Date = November 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> When [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] attacked the United Kingdom he personally attacked Faiza's family, injuring her mother while kidnapping her father and sending forces to attack the members of MI:13. In the aftermath of the attack, [[Pete Wisdom]] deduced that attack's aim was to keep Faiza (and Excalibur) out of the battle. He gives Faiza the codename "Excalibur" because he wants Dracula and his forces to hear and know that the mythical blade is still an active part of MI:13.<ref name="CB&MI13#11"/>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Faiza appears as a member of the Champions of Europe alongside [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], [[Captain Britain]], [[Guillotine (comics)|Guillotine]], [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]], and [[Peregrine (comics)|Peregrine]]. Alongside [[Squirrel Girl]] and Enigma,
the Champions free Paris, France from a Hydra invasion force. <ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #7 (2017)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Faiza Hussain is a trained doctor,<ref name="CB&MI13#1"/> and appears to have a wide knowledge of the superhuman population. Although being an unpowered character in the first issue, Paul Cornell stated Faiza's power(s) would manifest during the first few issues of ''Captain Britain and MI:13''.<ref name="PConFH"/> In issue 2 this came to pass, when Faiza Hussain showed an extreme level of control over [[biological organism]]s; she was able to disassemble a human body into its component parts while keeping the subject alive and stopped a horde of Skrulls by stopping their bodies from being able to move.<ref name="CB&MI3#2"/> She is seen to use these powers not only on living organisms, but also on other kinds of materials (like Black Knight's clothes).<ref name="CBMI4"/> The extent and classification of these powers are yet to be revealed, but Black Knight described them as purely defensive.<ref name="CBMI5"/>

In a Q&A Cornell outlined her powers:

{{cquote|She can safely open up a body, see what's wrong with it, and sort it out on a subatomic level. This has the incidental effect of halting shape-changers like Skrulls in their tracks (and anyone else who knows what's good for them). She has trouble doing this to magic beings.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20085 X-POSITION: Paul Cornell], [[Comic Book Resources]], February 17, 2009</ref>}}

Faiza's control over biological organisms does not work on any character or being infused with magic.

She also wields the sword Excalibur.

==Other versions==
In the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' crossover, Faiza Hussain briefly adopts the mantle of Captain Britain from Brian Braddock in case he would die battling Ultron.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' #15AU</ref>

This version of the character returns in the  two-part ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' tie-in, ''Captain Britain and the Mighty Defenders''. While she refers to herself as Captain Britain, she has no memory of what, where, or who "Britain" is due to the recent destruction of the Multiverse.<ref>''Captain Britain and the Mighty Defenders'' #1-2</ref>

== In other media ==
Faiza appears in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]'' as a playable character.
