'''Shang-Chi''' ({{zh|t=上氣|p=shàng qì|l=rising of the spirit}}) is a fictional character, often called the "Master of [[Kung Fu]]", appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]]. Shang-Chi is an extraordinary master of numerous unarmed and weaponry-based [[Chinese martial arts|wushu]] styles, including the use of the ''[[Gun (staff)|gun]]'', ''[[nunchaku]]'' and ''[[jian]]''. In later years, upon joining the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], he gains the power to create countless duplicates of himself.

==Publication history==
The character was conceived in late 1972. Marvel had wished to acquire the rights to adapt the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' television program, but were denied permission by the show's owner, [[Warner Communications]], owner of Marvel's primary rival, [[DC Comics]]. Instead, Marvel acquired the comic book rights to [[Sax Rohmer]]'s pulp villain [[Fu Manchu|Dr. Fu Manchu]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/entrevista_starlin_eng01.cfm|title= A success written in the stars|date= March 3, 2001|publisher= [[Universo HQ]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101125065341/http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/entrevista_starlin_eng01.cfm|archivedate= November 25, 2010|deadurl= yes}}</ref> They developed Shang-Chi, a master of kung fu, who was introduced as a previously unknown son of Fu Manchu.<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 161|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Capitalizing on the popularity of martial arts movies, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jim Starlin]] created Marvel's ''Master of Kung Fu'' series.

Shang-Chi first appeared in ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15 (December [[1973 in comics|1973]]) by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Jim Starlin]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Cooke| first = Jon B.| title = Comic Book Artist Collection: Volume 3| publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year = 2005|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|pages = 6–7|chapter= Everybody was Kung Fu Watchin'! The Not-So-Secret Origin of Shang-Chi, Kung-Fu Master!|isbn = 1-893905-42-X}}</ref> He appeared again in issue #16, and with issue #17 (April 1974) the title was changed to ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu]]''. Amidst the martial arts craze in the United States in the 1970s, the book became very popular, surviving until issue #125 (June 1983), a run including four giant-size issues and an annual. ''Special Collector's Edition'' #1 (1975) cover-titled as "Savage Fists of Kung Fu" reprinted stories from ''The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #1-2; ''The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Special'' #1; and ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2265|title= Special Collector's Edition}}</ref> He did several crossovers with other Marvel martial artists, including the [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] ([[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]]). He appeared regularly in ''[[The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]''.

Shang-Chi had two more short series: the ''Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black'' one-shot (1990) and the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] miniseries ''Master of Kung Fu: Hellfire Apocalypse'' (2002) with artist Paul Gulacy on art again. The character had two stories in the [[anthology]] series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', including one by Moench that ran in the series' first eight issues in 1988, and co-starred in the ''[[Moon Knight]] Special'' (1992). In 1997 a story arc starring Shang-Chi ran in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #514-516, and was intended to lead into a miniseries for the character in 1998.<ref>{{cite news | last = Middaugh | first= Dallas | date = August 1997 | title = ''Journey into Mystery'' to Launch New Titles | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = #72 | page = 23}}</ref>

Although spun out of licensed properties, Shang-Chi is a Marvel-owned character and has been firmly established as a part of the [[Marvel Universe]] with guest appearances in numerous other titles, such as ''Marvel Team-Up'', ''[[Marvel Knights]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''. Most of the original, licensed characters in the supporting cast have been phased out in the more recent series and stories.

In some of his modern appearances, mention is made of his villainous father either in cryptic terms or using a variety of new names, due to Marvel no longer having the rights to Fu Manchu. In ''Secret Avengers'' #6-10, writer Ed Brubaker officially sidestepped the entire issue via a storyline where a rogue group of S.H.I.E.L.D agents resurrect a zombified version of Fu Manchu only to discover that "Fu Manchu" was only an alias, and that Shang-Chi's father was really Zheng Zu, an ancient Chinese sorcerer who discovered the secret to immortality.

Shang-Chi returned as a main character in the 2007 ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' comic book.

==Fictional character biography==
{{cleanup-tense|date=September 2011}}
===''Master of Kung Fu''===
Shang-Chi was born in the [[Hu'nan]] province of the [[People's Republic of China]], and is the son of [[Fu Manchu (comics)|Fu Manchu]], the Chinese mastermind who has repeatedly attempted world conquest and had a thirst for blood.  His mother was a [[White Americans|white American]] woman genetically selected by his father. Shang-Chi was raised and trained from birth in the martial arts by his father and his instructors. Believing his father was a benevolent humanitarian, Shang-Chi was sent on a mission to [[London]] to murder Dr. Petrie, who his father said was evil and a threat to peace.  After successfully assassinating Petrie, he encountered Fu Manchu's archenemy, Sir Denis Nayland Smith, who revealed to Shang-Chi his father's true nature.  After meeting his mother in [[New York City]] for the truth, Shang-Chi realized that Fu Manchu was evil. Shang-Chi fought his way past Fu Manchu's guards at his New York headquarters, telling his father that they were now enemies and vowing to put an end to his evil schemes.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Steve Englehart|Englehart, Steve]]|penciller= [[Jim Starlin|Starlin, Jim]]|inker= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]|story= Shang Chi, Master of Kung Fu!|title= Special Marvel Edition|issue= #15|date= December 1973}}</ref> Shang-Chi subsequently fought his adoptive brother [[Midnight Sun (Marvel Comics)|Midnight]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve|penciller= Starlin, Jim|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= Midnight Brings Dark Death!|title= Special Marvel Edition|issue= #16|date= February 1974}}</ref> and then first met his close ally [[Black Jack Tarr]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve|penciller= Starlin, Jim|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= Lair of the Lost!|title= Master of Kung Fu|issue= #17|date= April 1974}}</ref> Shangi-Chi became an ally of Sir Denis Nayland Smith, and opposed Fu Manchu, and battled the Si-Fan assassins.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve|penciller= [[Paul Gulacy|Gulacy, Paul]]|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= |title= Master of Kung Fu|issue= #18|date= June 1974}}</ref>

===Return===
Some time later, Shang-Chi returned from China and rejoined Tarr, Reston and Wu. They battled Argus' terroristic group, formed to cause the United States to act more aggressively against all terrorists. In order to gain information, Argus had Wu tortured, cutting off her left hand as a message. She was rescued by Shang-Chi and the others, but not before he suffered a dose of a slow-acting poison.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= [[Tom Grindberg|Grindberg, Tom]]|inker= [[Dave Cockrum|Cockrum, Dave]]|story= Crossing Lines Part 8: Kills|title= [[Marvel Comics Presents]]|issue= #8|date= Early December 1988}}</ref> Before the poison could kill him, he was cured of the its effects by Fu Manchu's [[Elixir of life|elixir vitae]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Moench, Doug|penciller= [[David Day (comics)|Day, David]]; [[Dan Day (comics)|Day, Dan]]|inker= Day, David; Day, Dan|story= Bleeding Black|title= Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black|issue= #1|date= February 1990}}</ref>

Still working for MI6, he goes on to collaborate with [[Pete Wisdom]] of MI-13 in facing the [[Welsh dragon]], which had turned amnesiac and become a human crimelord.

==Powers and abilities==
Although it has never been determined exactly how extensive Shang-Chi's fighting skills are, he has beaten numerous superhuman opponents.  Shang-Chi is classed as an athlete but he is one of the best non-superhumans in martial arts and has dedicated much of his life to the art, being referred to by some as the greatest empty-handed fighter and practitioner of kung fu alive. Much of his physical abilities seem to stem from his mastery of chi, which often allows him to surpass physical limitations of normal athletes.  He has also demonstrated the ability to dodge bullets from machine guns and sniper rifles, and is able to deflect gunshots with his bracers. Shang-Chi is also highly trained in the arts of concentration and meditation, and is an expert in various hand weapons including swords, staves, [[kali stick]]s, nunchaku, and shuriken.

Following exposure to the cosmic radiation from the Incursions, Shang-Chi was able to create an unlimited number of duplicates of himself.{{issue|date=May 2016}}
