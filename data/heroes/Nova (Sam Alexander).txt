He first appears in the episode "Back in Black" where the Nova Centurian Helmet that is in his possession is being sought out by the Nova Corps. Rocket Raccoon and Groot try to take on the bounty for it where they end up fighting Sam until Star-Lord breaks him up. As Drax the Destroyer trains him in combat, Sam detects a signal that leads him to a secret lab on Spartax where [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] is and she manipulates him into freeing the Universal Believers' patriarch [[J'son (comics)|J'son]]. In the episode "Knights in Black Helmets", Nova accompanies J'son and Mantis to a Xandarian spaceship inside the stomach of a space whale that stores the Nova Centurian Helmets.
