'''Theresa Maeve Rourke Cassidy''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Debuting under the codename '''Siryn''', she later retired the name and started using '''Banshee''', in honor of her late father, [[Banshee (comics)|Sean Cassidy]], who first used the alias.

Like her father, the X-Men's [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], Theresa is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses a "sonic scream" capable of incapacitating and injuring an opponent's hearing and sending powerful vibrations through the air. She can use these vibrations to fly. Her name refers to the [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]] of [[Greek mythology]].

Theresa was raised by Banshee's cousin and nemesis [[Black Tom Cassidy]] without Banshee's knowledge. By her early teens, she left Black Tom and eventually joined the X-Men offshoots [[X-Force]] and later [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]].

==Publication history==

Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Steve Leialoha]], Siryn first appeared in ''[[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]'' #37 (April 1981), where she appears as a villain. Along with many young mutants at the time such as [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Multiple Man]], she featured in the limited series ''[[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]]'' (1987). She was one of the first members of ''[[X-Force]]'' (vol. 1) (1991), beginning in issue #3, and remained a regular in that book through issue #100 (2000).  As a love interest of [[Deadpool]], she concurrently appeared in one of his earliest solo titles-- ''Deadpool: Sins of the Past'' (1994), and sporadically appeared in ''Deadpool'' (vol. 1) (1997) and ''[[Cable and Deadpool]]'' (vol. 1) (2005). In 2006, she rejoined forces with Multiple Man as a member of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (vol. 3) through issue #244 (2012), in which she becomes The Morrigan and leaves the team and general publication.

==Fictional character biography==
{{cleanup-tense|date=September 2011}}

===Early life===
While Sean Cassidy was working on a deep undercover mission for [[Interpol]], his wife Maeve gave birth to their daughter, Theresa, at Cassidy Keep, County Mayo, Ireland. Not much later, Maeve dies in an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing. With no means to contact Sean, his cousin [[Black Tom Cassidy|Tom]] takes care of Theresa. When Sean returns to learn of his wife's death, he is devastated. Before Tom can even tell him of the existence of his daughter, Sean lashes out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve. While Sean flies away in anger, Tom falls into a chasm, breaking his leg as a result of the attack, which leaves him with a limp. Tom swears to make Sean pay and vows to never tell him about his daughter, raising her himself instead.{{issue|date=October 2013}}

Tom (now known as Black Tom) trains Theresa as his apprentice in his criminal activities. While still a young teen, Theresa accompanies Black Tom and his then-partner, the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Here, employing the name Siryn, she aids them in a theft of [[vibranium]], and battles the original [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #37. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> Due to her inexperience, she performs poorly in battle and is defeated by Spider-Woman again during Black Tom's temporary capture. Initially believing her to be seriously hurt, Black Tom resolves to break all association with her so that she will not be exposed to further danger. While in custody, he exonerates Theresa of responsibility for her crimes,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #38 Marvel Comics.</ref> and writes a letter to Sean explaining who she is. The X-Men bring Theresa back to their headquarters, where she is joyfully reunited with her father.<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]]. ''Uncanny X-Men'' #148 Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Muir Island===
[[Image:xforce90.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''X-Force'' #90 in which Feral injures Siryn.]]
Theresa soon moved to [[Muir Island]], home of the research laboratories of [[Moira MacTaggert|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]], a longtime ally of [[Professor X]]avier.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} During an overnight visit to Xavier Institute, Siryn, [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Illyana Rasputin]], and a young Muir Island resident named Amp battled robotic duplicates of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] after accidentally releasing them from the [[Danger Room]]. Later in the evening, Siryn engaged Kitty in a vicious fist fight after Amp convinced her that the young X-Man was trying to sabotage her chances with a young man named Dimitri. After the fight was broken up by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], the girls reconciled and left on friendly terms.<ref>[[Van Lente, Fred]]. ''Wolverine: First Class'' #6 Marvel Comics.</ref> She also accompanied Wolverine and Kitty when they were asked by Professor Xavier to act as bodyguards for the mutant pop-star [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]. Dazzler was so impressed with Theresa's rendition of "[[Amazing Grace]]", that she asked the young mutant to act as a [[backing vocalist]] for her concert.<ref>[[David, Peter]] (w). ''Wolverine: First Class'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While living back on the island, Siryn started a romantic relationship with the mutant known as [[Jamie Madrox]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  This version of Multiple Man turned out to be one of his many duplicates and not the original Multiple Man, leading to the end of the relationship.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  During this time Siryn and Multiple Man traveled to [[New York City]].<ref>''Fallen Angels'' #1 Marvel Comics.</ref> She and Madrox began a search to help the [[New Mutants]] find two of their members, [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], who had run away from the school.<ref>''Fallen Angels'' #2 Marvel Comics.</ref>  In the course of this adventure, Siryn and Multiple Man found Sunspot and met the association of street-level mutants known as the [[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]].<ref>''Fallen Angels'' #3 Marvel Comics.</ref> They were transported, with the Fallen Angels, to [[Devil Dinosaur]]'s planet.<ref>''Fallen Angels'' #4.

Later, back on Muir Island, she fell under the mental control of the [[Shadow King]].<ref>Claremont, Chris. ''Uncanny X-Men'' #278 Marvel Comics.</ref> Before long, she was freed from the Shadow King's control.<ref>Claremont, Chris. ''Uncanny X-Men'' #280. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===X-Force===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2009}}
[[Image:Deadpool3-56.PNG|right|thumb|200px|Deadpool and Siryn, by [[Karl Kerschl]]]]
Siryn becomes a core member of [[X-Force]], a [[paramilitary]] superhero team and for a time was its field leader. As a member of X-Force, her teammate [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] develops a romantic interest in her while Siryn begins an ongoing flirtation with the mercenary [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]. Deadpool and Siryn initially became involved when the two met while fighting Black Tom Cassidy and the Juggernaut. Though Banshee warns Siryn that Deadpool was a madman and a murderer, she found herself quite taken with him, even looking past his horrific appearance. Due to this kindness, Deadpool becomes infatuated with Siryn and often sat outside her window as she slept in the X-Mansion. At first Siryn is unaware of this, but she is comforted in knowing that he is watching over her. Over time, Siryn became the voice of reason and sanity in Deadpool's ear, attempting to sway him to the side of good. She assists him in some of his missions, such as when Deadpool felt he needed some blood from the [[Hulk]] in order to cure problems with his own healing powers.<ref>''Deadpool''  Vol. 3 #4</ref> In the end Siryn becomes overwhelmed with balancing her duties with X-Force and the demands of Deadpool's somewhat faulty sanity. She promises him that she would consider progressing their relationship if he continues on the path of good, and once she has her X-Force responsibilities secured. Warpath continues to seek Siryn's affections, and makes his dislike for Deadpool clear during a visit to the baseball diamond used in the movie, ''[[Field of Dreams]]''.<ref>''Deadpool'' (vol. 3) #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Siryn confronts varied adversaries during her time in X-Force. She helps put down a coup in the other dimensional realm of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. She confronts the forces of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] and the interdimensional media mogul known as [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]. She even battles [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] forces on more than one occasion. She also confronts more down to earth problems, particularly [[alcoholism]]. Warpath helps her to cope with her drinking problems, and as of recent issues of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] she is leading a sober lifestyle.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

She becomes a vital part of the team, as opined by an aspect of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]],<ref>''[[X-Force]]'' (vol. 1) #68. Marvel Comics.</ref> which saves the entire team from a near-death experience.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

She leaves when [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], a former teammate turned villain, slashes her throat, destroying her vocal cords and rendering her temporarily [[speech disorder|mute]] and powerless.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 1) #90 (May 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Thanks to the aid of Deadpool, Siryn has since fully healed from her vocal cord injuries.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} Deadpool tracked down [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and stole a sample of his blood to heal her.<ref>''Wolverine'' #154 - #155 (Sept, Oct 2000), Marvel Comics.</ref>

Siryn joins the [[Paris]] branch of the international mutant task force [[X-Corporation]], claiming to atone for her father's sins for his failed X-Corps idea. There she reunites with old friends such as Multiple Man, [[Rictor]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], and works for the first time with [[M (Marvel Comics)|Monet St. Croix]].<ref>''New X-Men'' (vol. 1) #128, Marvel Comics.</ref> Their first mission does not go well and Siryn has to deal with the loss of teammate [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]].<ref>''New X-Men'' (vol. 1) #130 (Oct 2002), Marvel Comics.</ref>

===X-Factor Investigations===
Siryn leaves X-Corporation to become a member of [[X-Factor Investigations]]. As part of her initial duties for X-Factor Investigations, Siryn investigates the murder of a woman who died in a movie star's penthouse, on behalf of the victim's sister.

Siryn and X-Factor Investigations manages to incriminate the star, and to thwart Singularity Investigation's assassination attempt on [[Rictor]].<ref>David, Peter (w). ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #8-9 (March - April 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> Damian Tryp Jr. is so infuriated that he later ambushes Siryn and beats her, leaving her to die in an alley.

While recovering from her injuries, Cyclops approaches Theresa and informs her Banshee has died.

The girl attempts to send the Morrigan back but she ignores the girl and takes Theresa; furious that she has been using the name Banshee, one of the many names associated with the Morrigan. Taking her to a lighthouse, the Morrigan offers Theresa a choice; apologize and worship her or die.

'''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #244.

Working with Layla, the duo attempt to summon the Morrigan but instead Theresa is teleported to Ireland. During the confrontation, Theresa asks if the Morrigan can heal Lorna but the Morrigan advises her she cannot as Lorna does not believe in her. The Morrigan reveals she is tired of being a goddess and misses her own father; if she wishes to truly help Lorna, she will need to become the Morrigan. Theresa agrees and then hurls a sonic lance through the Morrigan, killing her. In that moment, Lorna is completely healed of her insanity. Theresa teleports back to headquarters, appearing before Madrox as the Morrigan and telling him goodbye. Theresa lets him know she never stopped loving him and if he needs her, all he has to do is pray before departing.<ref name="XFactorV3#244"/>

''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #262. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Siryn is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses sonic powers similar to those of her father, [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], although she is able to use her powers in ways that Banshee apparently cannot.  Like her father, she has the ability to emit high-decibel "sonic screams" to create various sonic effects with her vocal cords. She can vary the pitch to deflect [[projectile]]s, and she even used it to deflect lasers once.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} She possesses an enhanced sense of hearing and can use her voice for echolocation to detect objects. While screaming, Siryn is able to fly at the speed of sound. Siryn has especially potent sonic attacks. She can shatter objects; project concussive blasts of sonic force (a "sonic lance"); cause immediate pain, nausea/vomiting, and unconsciousness. She has shown a degree of resistance to what would be harmful and painful sounds and vibrations to normal humans or mutants without sonic-based powers.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #30 Marvel Comics.</ref> She possesses psionic powers to create a force field that protects her against her own sonic vibrations to assist her ability to fly, and to help direct her sonic powers.

She is vulnerable to losing the ability to use her power effectively by overstraining and overusing her sonic screams or injury to her throat and [[vocal folds|vocal cords]].<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 1) #90 Marvel Comics.</ref> She lacks fine control of her abilities when in extreme distress: screaming in pain during her pregnancy, she unwillingly shattered every window in the complex, causing the medical staff to writhe in agony.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor #39 Marvel Comics. (2009)</ref>

Unlike her father, Siryn is able to influence and control other human beings with her sonics, as well as cause them to enter a [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] state. Siryn can cause the intended person to fall in love with her without regard to gender or sexual orientation and carry out her wishes and commands, like mythical [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]].<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #1. Marvel Comics. January 2006</ref> Siryn once utilized this ability on [[Spider-Man]], forcing him to divulge the truth about the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] of the mutants.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #8. Marvel Comics. August 2006</ref>

In addition, she can prevent others from hearing external sounds by a certain vocal pitch so that she can secretly deliver messages to them.<ref>''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Since becoming the Morrigan, Theresa has gained numerous undefined mystical abilities. Her known powers include the ability to teleport by her own free will or to people who summon her using the correct ritual; heal her followers and people with a personal bond to her; some form of immortality or longevity as the previous Morrigan mentioned she was over two millennia old.<ref name="XFactorV3#244"/> She is able to revert Jamie Madrox to his human form and absorb laser blasts from a gun that can destroy Layla Miller's force field.<ref>David, Peter.
