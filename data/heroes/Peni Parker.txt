== Fictional character biography ==
Peni's father as the original SP//dr, protected the city of New York from crime and other dangers. After his mysterious death, his daughter, Peni Parker was approached by her [[Aunt May#Spider-Verse|aunt]] and [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|uncle]] to be the new pilot of the SP//dr. In order to do so, she needed to be bitten by the sentient radioactive spider which controlled part of the suit. After being bitten, she became the new protector of the city. She eventually teams up with [[Alternative versions of Daredevil#Spider-Verse|Daredevil]] – who had known her father – to take some criminals down and, eventually, battle [[Mysterio#Spider-Verse|Mysterio]]. Then, when taking a subway to go to her school, she's approached by [[Spider-Ham]] and Old Man Spider to join the Spider-Army to fight the [[Inheritors (comics)|Inheritors]].

After the events of [[Spider-Verse]], in school she's approached by a girl named ''Addy Brock''. She asked Peni if she was really the SP//dr pilot, but Peni ignored her and then Addy stated that Peni is not as special as she thinks. She tries to talk to Ben and May about being special, but she gets ignored. When improving the Web Shooters on the SP//dr, she notices Addy walking in the base and follows her only to find another mech-suit similar to the SP//dr, but black with the name [[Alternative versions of Venom#Spider-Geddon|VEN#m]] and then she gets furious at her aunt and uncle for not telling her about the new suit. When a kaiju-like creature named [[Morbius the Living Vampire#Spider-Geddon|M.O.R.B.I.O.U.S.]] started to drain the city's electrical energy, SP//dr went after it, but was quickly pushed aside. In order to defeat M.O.R.B.I.O.U.S., they send VEN#m to defeat the creature. It was successful in stopping the monster, but the creature caused VEN#m to malfunction, resulting in the mech suit eventually gaining a mind of its own. The black suit started to consume Addy, and when May went to fix the problem manually, it started to consume her as well. SP//dr started to battle VEN#m, but the black mech suit was more powerful and it nearly destroyed SP//dr. Afterwards, Peni, then remembering the improved Web Shooters, was able to defeat VE#m, but was too late to save her Aunt May and Addy. Peni and Ben have a heart to heart moment, but then the Web-Warriors appear to recruit Peni again to help defeat the Inheritors who had returned in the event of [[Spider-Geddon]].
