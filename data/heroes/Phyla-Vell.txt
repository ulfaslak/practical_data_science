'''Phyla-Vell''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She has gone by the names '''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]''', '''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]''' and '''Martyr'''. She was created by [[Peter David]] and [[Paul Azaceta]] in ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 5) #16 (January 2004).

Her name is derived from the [[scientific classification]] [[phylum]], one of the levels of organization ([[taxon]]s) for classifying [[life]]. This is a reference to the fact that her brother [[Genis-Vell]]'s name comes from [[genus]], one of the other classifications for life forms.

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Phyla-Vell.png|thumb|upright|Phyla-Vell as Captain Marvel. ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' #17 (February 2004). Art by [[Paul Azaceta]].]]
After [[Genis-Vell]], then known as Captain Marvel, previously destroyed and recreated the universe, the "new" version was subtly altered with Phyla-Vell's existence being one of the changes. It is revealed that she is the second artificially created offspring of Captain Mar-Vell who was created by her mother [[Elysius]] in the "new" universe because her first attempt (Genis-Vell) had been so successful. Initially her origin conflicted with previously established storylines, but this is resolved in ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 4) #18 (February 2004).

She fights her brother Genis-Vell, who was insane at the time,<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 4 #17-18 (January–February 2004)</ref> in the process helping to restore his sanity. She then tries to lay claim to the "Captain Marvel" title, though her brother refuses to give it up.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 4 #19 (March 2004)</ref> Phyla is next seen at the trial of [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #12-13, 2006</ref>

The ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 4) series heavily hinted that Phyla-Vell is a [[lesbian]], and in #25 (September 2004) the character admits that she is attracted to [[Moondragon]] and invites her on a tour of the "[[spiral nebula]] near Renault VII". Before Moondragon can accept the two wander through a portal.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 5 #25</ref>

===Annihilation===
{{Main|Annihilation (comics)}}
Phyla later appeared during ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' where she had been visiting her father's grave with Moondragon when the pair were attacked by [[Thanos]] who ripped off Moondragon's ear and gave it to Phyla, telling her to go to [[Drax the Destroyer]] and how his actions would determine Moondragon's fate shortly before teleporting away with Moondragon. Drax has indicated he will not be stopping his pursuit of Thanos.<ref>''Annihilation'' #2</ref>

Phyla then goes with [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and [[Star-Lord]] to lead a final battle against [[Annihilus]], being saved at the last second by a massive energy wave caused by the just freed [[Galactus]], which left only the three heroes and Annihilus as survivors.  Ultimately in the battle, Phyla manages to steal away the [[quantum bands]] that Annihilus took from [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], weakening him and allowing Nova to finally bring an end to the Annihilation Wave.  She is then seen re-united with Moondragon, and deciding it's up to her to become the new Quasar.<ref>''Annihilation'' #6</ref>

===Annihilation: Conquest&nbsp;– Quasar===
{{See also|Annihilation: Conquest}}
Phyla had her own mini-series as the new Quasar, stating July through October 2007, called ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]&nbsp;– Quasar''. The series was written by [[Christos Gage]] (who wrote ''[[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]]''), penciled by [[Mike Lilly]]. Phyla is finding it hard to follow the footsteps of the former Quasar and also to follow in the Mar-Vell family’s footsteps. The story is a lot about her trying to handle this power, and seeing if she can contain it.  She’s on a quest, and the object of the quest has real importance, not only to her, but to the entire storyline. Phylla and her lover Moondragon follow a voice to find the saviour for the [[Kree]] race who is attacked by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]. In the end it turns out 'the voice' is the [[Supreme Intelligence]] of the Kree; thanks to the Supreme Intelligence they find a cocoon, in which [[Adam Warlock]] is restoring. The cocoon breaks open and Phyla and Moondragon ask Warlock to help them fight against the Phalanx. This story was continued in the main mini-series ''Annihilation: Conquest''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Back To Space In Marvel's Annihilation: Conquest|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=102941|website=[[Newsarama]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135443/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=102941|archivedate=September 29, 2007|date=February 26, 2007}}</ref>

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
{{See also|Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)}}
Following Annihilation, she joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #1</ref> While helping [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] search for Cammi, an Earth girl who he had taken into space before the Annihilation War, they consult a psychic to get a lead on Cammi's whereabouts only to be informed that Moondragon was trying to contact them.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #7</ref> They attempt to consult [[A'lars|Mentor]], who apparently kills them.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #9</ref> Mentor sends Phyla and Drax to [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]] where they encounter [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] and the [[Dragon of the Moon]].  After losing the Quantum Bands to Maelstrom Phyla is offered as a sacrifice to the Dragon so that Maelstrom can be in its good graces.  While inside the dragon she apparently makes a deal in exchange for Heather Douglas.  The dragon then releases them, with Phyla wearing a new red and black costume adorned with skulls and wielding a new sword, and they return to the world of the living where Phyla refuses to elaborate on the deal that she made with the Dragon.  It is later learned from Maelstrom that she agreed to become the new avatar of Oblivion.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #12</ref>

===Martyr===
Now calling herself Martyr, Phyla-Vell is a more abrasive and aggressive figure. When the Guardians attempted to negotiate with the Inhumans to stop the War of Kings, she ruined the attempt by taking [[Crystal (comics)|Inhuman princess Crystal]] hostage instead; this led to battle between the Inhumans and Guardians, while she continued to escalate.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #14</ref> Eventually, the Inhumans would try to end the war by detonating a weapon that shattered space itself, creating a multiversal Fault.<ref>''War of Kings'' #6</ref>

When [[Adam Warlock]] stopped the Fault's growth by using a redundant timeline, one where he became the villainous [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], Phyla-Vell revealed that her deal with Oblivion was to kill "the Avatar of Life" and she'd know what to do when the time came. Knowing he would now become Magus, she ran Adam through but this failed to stop his transformation. Several of the Guardians, then stranded in the year 3009, were then sent back in time to stop Magus' creation and Phyla was prevented from making her move. This time when Warlock was transformed, she engaged him in combat - but Magus magically teleported her own sword from her hands and slew her with it.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #17, 19 (December 2009)</ref>

However, Phyla was revealed to still be alive, along with Mantis, Gamora, Cosmo and Major Victory, but trapped in suspended animation and prisoners of the Magus.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #22 (January 2010)</ref> She then breaks free and frees the other Guardians, but after a fierce fight she is misled by Maelstrom into freeing [[Thanos]], who was concealed inside a cocoon. When the two teams of Guardians reunite, Phyla-Vell is reported as the first victim of Thanos' rampage, her remains seen by [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] but never shown on panel. She is later mourned by the Guardians on Knowhere.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #25, 19 (June 2010)</ref>

Phyla is later shown in [[Hell]] when Thanos and [[Deadpool]] venture there in search of the missing [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Tim Seeley|penciller = Elmo Bondoc|inker = Elmo Bondoc|colorist = Ruth Redmond|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D. White|story = Part Three|title = Deadpool vs. Thanos|volume = 1|issue = #3|date = 14 October 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>

Gamora later discovers Phyla trapped inside the [[Soul Gem]] alongside Adam Warlock.<ref>''All-New Guardians of the Galaxy'' #3</ref> When [[Kang the Conqueror]] later shows Warlock a vision of the future, Phyla is seen as one of the heroes who has been defeated by the mysterious villain that has collected all six Infinity Gems.<ref>''Infinity Countdown'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Phyla has superhuman strength. She can fire energy blasts and fly. She also acts like an "energy sponge,"  absorbing any energy attacks directed at her and returning them as energy blasts. She has cosmic awareness and is a proficient fighter.

She then came into possession of the [[Quasar (comics)#Quantum Bands|Quantum Bands]] formerly owned by [[Wendell Vaughn]]. The Bands grant vast energy manipulation powers, such as absorbing and transforming energy on a stellar level, forming solid energy constructs and forcefields, allowing for space travel and providing protection from telepathic attacks, but gaining the Bands has caused her to lose her cosmic awareness.

While searching for Heather Douglas, Phyla lost the Quantum Bands to the villain Maelstrom. She has gained unknown new powers by becoming the new avatar of Oblivion. However, Wendell has stated that her Quantum Sword will still draw power from the Quantum Bands and that they will always be a part of her.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #12, 19 (May 2009)</ref>
